Of course, this idea skips over the realistic problems we have to confront first before we can attain such an optimal system. Mainly, corruption of power and greed.
What do you think China will do with its workers once it automates all its factories? What do you think executives more interested in stroking their own ego and increasing quarterly profits will do with their employees they no longer need? 
Make no mistake. With such increasingly capable artificial intelligence, our economic and social systems will change or be forced to change.
That change can be all unneeded human beings gunned down by perfectly functioning autonomous weapons. That change can be all unneeded human beings living in shanty towns and surviving off of the scraps of the ones in control. That change can be a great Rapture, where our material concerns are consistently and attentively met by machines.

Technology at its very base is tools. The ""first"" scientific discovery of our species was discovering it's easier to open things like bones for bone marrow by hitting it with something hard, the resultant technology being simple stones people consistemtly used to make their lives just a little bit easier. But the same tools were easily used to smash the skull of another human being.
Now, we are at the brink. We can be free of disease and hunger, we can all have comfortable shelter. We can be free to pursue our passions rather than limited material wealth. Art, Philosophy, Science, enjoying nature. We can be finally free. But we must overcome our growing pains for ourselves and the future peoples of our world. We cannot allow the corrupt to smirk as they step upon those less fortunate then them. We cannot allow genocide, or extremism, or oppression.
This change is an opportunity. If we finally uproot all old hatreds and corruptions and discriminations, they will not have the power to root themselves in the new world. A women being abused will have people stand up for her because people don't have to worry about simple survival. A person being corrupt will have no support, for there will be so much wealth that to have an appreciable amount more than others will result in criticism rather than praise for there is only so much material wealth that can be properly used and enjoyed by an individual.

I know Wassmer has other papers on the topic, too. I did similar (but not identical) econometric analysis and I analyzed Milwaukee and its suburbs (over 30 municipalities in total) rather than Detroit. I researched and categorized all government handouts to all private business that came in the form of tax increment financing and industrial development bonds, categorized the spending as primarily intended to support retail, service, or manufacturing employment. I controlled for every important variable I could find, like average age, racial characteristics, crime rates, etcetera, and then I ran the numbers against thirty years of Economic Census jobs data (11 or 12 longitudanal data points, as I recall). I calculated with a time delay and tested for geographical relationships between data sets to see if it looked like a community was benefiting from nearby communities' spending rather than it's own.

In the end, I found broadly similar results to Anderson and Wassmer's. Government handouts to private businesses intended to help create manufacturing jobs were strongly associated with increased value of goods manufactured (richer managers / stockholders) and with decreased manufacturing employment (poorer workers). Spending on retail did nothing (at least it didn't hurt anything), and the effect on service employment was weakly positive. That retail would be worthless is pretty obvious; retail spending is a function of disposable income, not how many stores there are. Spending on manufacturing being a bad thing for employment might not be obvious, but I believe it's logical. Just think about examples like Global Foundries' Fab 8 in Malta, NY. That's among the highest value manufacturing facilities in the world. It cost $12 billion to build and it makes several times that much in chips each year. It employs a grand total of 3,300 mostly college-educated people. That's well and good, those are fine jobs, but such factories are hardly going to re-employ the non-collegiate masses with family-supporting jobs, is it? That's almost $4,000,000 of investment per job created. If the government's goal is to create jobs for less educated people, it's not hard to see how that's not an efficient approach.

Now, obviously, understanding this kind of analysis is not Trump's strong suit. He very honestly does not have a working understanding of economics nor the good judgement to trust people who do. He might have actually believed what he was saying, who knows, but it was clearly false.

[],Heraklines,,,[],,,,text,t2_kjg7o,False,[],"It becomes very clear when you picture why there is an economy in the first place. An economy is essentially a system in which scarce ressources with alternative uses are allocated towards what the market decides as being its optimal usage, this is has been done with prices which act as a valve mechanism. If we arrive at a post-scarcity situation, which if I would be technical about it is impossible since the accessible part of the universe only has finite ressources, so what I am really talking about is very low scarcity in which even in a free market economy your bills for all your needs(shelter, food,..) are essentially just a footnote on your monthly bill. 

How did I arrive at my conclusion that post scarcity is only a few decades away? I just used the arguments put forward by proponents of UBI-like systems and took it to its logical conclusions based on the trajectory of current technological developpement. You guys will agree with me that stuff like self-driving cars, cashier robots, and other low skill automation will automate more then 20% jobs. A lot of people arent really able to just #learntocode and get another job, some will really just be straigh up unemployable through no fault of their own (CPG Grey did a great video on this). So far we should agree on at least that. Now if you paid attention to recent technological developpements, you'll notice that the pace at which technology is developing is ever increasing( you can look up a lot of different industries for graphs, notice how the S-curves that a technology takes becomes narrower and steeper every time), I disagree with the hole singularity argument and attribute this more to the way we lay over ever more abstract tools on top of each other and optimise their usage continously. Anyway, if current robots and AIs can already perform the labor of so many people, no one is safe from automation. If this trend doesnt abruptly stop(no major wars), the trajectory is patently obvious. I work in the tech field(HPC) and I just cannot compete with a super computer automating my job as well in a good 20 years, neither can any of you. As soon as we hit AGI levels of AI the jig is up ,btw we already hit the estimated flop count for human brains with some super computers. The actual time estimate for AGI emerging I took from an average of a poll taken by experts in the field of AI giving their estimates for how long it will take.If you want a detailled analysis what this kind of tech means, you can look it up yourself, but here is the long and short of it: human labor will become obsolete. As you can imagine this might change a few dynamics.

Now what does this have to do with ""we can make any system work""? An economic theory only works  if there is ressource scarcity, with robots doing all the labor, the only bottleneck on ressources is 2 things: time and expansion. What does that have to with communism? Communism fails because it discourages productivity as it allocates ressources more or less equally and therefore these ressources will not be optimally used. If there is no need to allocate these ressources optimally because you have near infinite supply of labor, then you can play communist without needing to resort to slave labor -&gt; gulags.

[],BioLogicPodcast,,,[],,,,text,t2_1658ew,False,[],"You're talking about this as if its some untested, radically experimental concept, when it's virtually the exact opposite. It's the functional model for capitalism, and it worked for decades before corruption and new capitalist models were instituted (trickle down). 

Marx made a very insightful criticism of capitalism; that capital begets capital. In other words, it is easy to create wealth when you already have wealthy. In other words, the wealthy get wealthier in a laissez-faire capitalist system. The wealthy are a numerically small class with disproportionate wealth. They have more money than they can actually reasonably spend in a lifetime. They might have a million times as much wealth as a poor person, but they aren't buying a million times as many goods.

The poor person spends more of his more often. This isn't a value judgement on spending patterns, it's a mathematical inevitability. If you have less money, then proportionately more of it is spent covering the costs of living, and proportionately less of it is left over for discretionary spending. If the large masses of poor people have less discretionary income, then less money is spent on goods and services outside of the basics needed to stay alive. Sometimes even that doesn't get covered, if the family is poor enough. Food insecurity is a large but unacknowledged problem in the US. 

If the masses of poor aren't spending money, demand for goods and services drops across the board, and the economy slows. However, when social policies are instituted that protect the poor (unions, higher wages, benefits, etc.), the poor have more discretionary income; more money is spent on goods and services; more money cycles through the economy, and the economy hums along nicely. There is a sustainable cycle of money going back and forth between consumers and producers. 

When those protections are dismantled, the flow of money down to the consumers (wages, etc.) dries up. Discretionary income drops. Economic activity slows. And the natural structure of capitalism will see wealth become concentrated in the hands of the wealthy, in the hands of the owners of capital. We see this today, with unions at their weakest point, wages having stagnated for decades, and wealth inequality at it's most extreme in a century and a half.

In the modern day, where owners of capital are extremely wealthy, and where automation is removing jobs and failing to replace them, and where wages have stagnated close to or even blow the ever-increasing cost of living for most people, the economic future looks bleak for everyone but the super rich. But even for them, things wont last forever, because how cant he capitalist system sustain itself when the underclass of consumers has no discretionary income with which to consume? Capitalism will eat itself, unless some kind of system of re-distribution is put in place, to ensure that masses of consumers actually have some discretionary money to put in the marketplace. Without it, economic growth will slow and stall as consumer activity necessarily drops. The worst outcome is that modern economies resurrect a kind of neo-feudalism, like that which was born in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 

&gt;Some people are just dead sure it will work and I have no idea what  evidence they base that on. Minor tests in super poor countries like  India?

But for your question, that's why many of the smaller and middle-sized companies *do* still employ large numbers of manual laborers.  

They'll also typically automate in stages.  One work cell may be automated, and then they'll slowly upgrade everything as they plan five and ten year budgets. 

There are also other impediments to automating.  Take medical equipment, for example, especially an implant or anything that will go into or touch a human patient.  The entire manufacturing process must be cleared and documented through the FDA.  If one of those steps is a manual process, that's documented and cemented in procedure. 

To automate, you need to now clear that new stage with the FDA, which restarts the entire clearance process.  It's a huge pain in the ass, and not worth the trouble.  So that company is only going to automate when they have a brand new product and are clearing a brand new process. 

All of this means that automation happens at a much slower pace than it could theoretically happen. 

Which is why, back to the original point in the OP, it's so important that we use this luxury of time to help manual laborers in exceptionally vulnerable positions transition to other jobs and other skills so that we are ready when automation picks up pace.",1569507328,{},f1i8c9g,False,t3_d9htcl,False,True,t1_f1i755f,/r/Futurology/comments/d9htcl/coal_industry_continues_sharp_decline_us_coal/f1i8c9g/,1569507340.0,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, a negative income tax might sound better on paper but has a lot more administration required. Also, unless you completely revamp the current tax model, it'll have to be calculated or payed out yearly, which is less optional due to monthly bills. 

Current social safety nets don't reach everyone who needs it, most who are on it dislike the policing, requirements and case workers are only human and make mistakes that can have deadly outcomes. It also traps people in poverty. Expanding it seems like an ineffective method to me.

A Ubi also has the benefit of an economic boost, especially in smaller communities.

Lastly, with automation and AI advancing at the pace it is, there will be displacement in unprecedented scales. New jobs will pop up but for must of the displaced workers, those options are likely not an option. A 40-something cashier at Walmart is not likely to be able to land a job at some new tech firm or whatever other job pops up.

Further, I must admit, this lack of courage in these legacy companies is perhaps much less a function of personal will and much more a function of their law-required fiduciary duty to the profits of their shareholders. So it is only in new blood can revolution in any market truly occur.

Elon's methods need work. His attitude needs work. And much like many famous people, his Twitter communication needs a buffer of a lawyer or two to ensure he no longer says things that are outright illegal as this is not the first time he's gotten into trouble for an easily avoidable comment.

Further, since Elon is such an industry rabble-rouser, I also believe that his legal dealings and any un-news-worthy goings on at his company or with his products instantly become targeted news.

That could be cool, or it could be a catastrophic failure. I don't know.

I know my dad was working for a major engineering firm, and he wasn't allowed to move his own desk in his own office because the union had a monopoly on furniture moving in addition to doing machine shop labor, maintenance and normal union work. Instead of being reasonable, they held the plant hostage. Whole plant closed down instead. My dad being a gifted engineer was fine. I'm guessing a lot of union guys, not fine, and that area is probably still hurt by the closing of the plant. The company is still in the US too, because it's doing defense work, so they are just paying other American workers where unions are less popular. 

Ultimately I don't think I'll ever be convinced that healthcare should come through a job, or that the best way to protect workers is through unions. I think they're are better ways, and that unions are outdated pretty much across the board, but until other systems get support, they are the best option for many workers.

It's a dangerous approach though, the same way that minimum wage laws are dangerous
 The US sector at least is scrambling to automate away as many jobs as possible because paying wages and taxes and benefits for workers is so expensive, and we are rapidly approaching a time when workers will be unnecessary, and companies can still stay in the US, hiring almost no one, gaining huge increases in profit. Unions don't help at all and neither does minimum wage. They just speed up the conversion and make it more profitable to ditch workers.

Universal healthcare and universal disbursements in general are likely to be much better for workers and consumption taxes prevent the cost of operation from unreasonably favoring offshore production. They spread out the population and decrease crowding and the associated housing price spike, and make minimum wage irrelevant if the disbursements are high enough. Having no minimum wage let's some businesses avoid automation, especially if workers like the work, whereas businesses that don't have enjoyable work need to pay workers enough to be willing to trade their free time for additional resources, and truly awful jobs will likely see that they're are not sufficiently desperate workers to convince them to do it, thus requiring automation or allowing the job to go undone.

This is obviously entirely contingent on the universal baseline being high enough that awful jobs are just left vacant, and people are at least scraping by in some standard of decency with zero employment.  If the disbursements are insufficient, it would be very bad to lack a minimum wage and unions and all that, but I'm convinced with the right value, it would be far superior and far more efficient.",1569071752,{},f0yjmnv,False,t3_d72tr9,False,True,t1_f0y9aau,/r/technology/comments/d72tr9/antiunion_activity_is_heating_up_ahead_of_google/f0yjmnv/,1569071763.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unions are like a gateway drug to UBI because a Union can basically say: look, we want a living wage for 30 hours a week, and we can offload x work to the robots and instead of providing This type of work, we can now do this other high value work.

Then switch it to 20 and hiring freezes. Then 10 hours.

Many of the software features offered in smart TVs are just thrown together and slapped on so that they have something new to advertise.

This study investigates how highly automated vehicles (AVs) may affect VoTT, using an existing mode—ridehailing services (RHS)—as an analogy for AVs. Both AVs and RHS relieve travelers from the effort of driving and allow them to participate in other activities while traveling. In a stated choice experiment, respondents chose between driving a personal vehicle or taking an RHS, with each mode characterized by a cost and travel time. Analysis results using a mixed logit model indicated that the VoTT was 13% lower when being driven in an RHS than when driving a personal car. We also told half the respondents (randomly selected) that the RHS was driverless; and for half (also randomly selected) we explicitly mentioned the ability to multitask while traveling in an RHS. Mentioning multitasking explicitly led to a much lower VoTT, approximately half that of driving oneself. However, the VoTT in a driverless RHS was 15% higher than when driving a personal car, which may reflect a lack of familiarity and comfort with driverless technology at present. These results suggest sizable reductions in VoTT for travel in future AVs, and point to the need for caution in making forecasts based on consumers’ current perceptions of AV technology.",1568670591,{},f0k56mq,True,t3_d578kd,False,True,t3_d578kd,/r/technology/comments/d578kd/americans_would_rather_drive_themselves_to_work/f0k56mq/,1568670592.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notice the fee was levied by the FCC? the government was more concerned with possible interference with comms from other satellites than a collision.

I don't, thanks. The idea of rocket propulsion is to throw mass out the back rapidly (mv^2 ) to push the rest of the rocket forward. It's why Xenon is used in electric drives for example. And there is a small push to more massive fuels for chemical rockets by some members of the community recently for the same reasons.

[edit: I used methane before. Fixed it.] Methanol's molar mass is only half that of UDMH anyway. And both combustions will incorporate oxygen so I can't see how the combustion products would be higher. So I don't find your answer to be at all explanatory. Do you actually not know the answer? If so, just say so. It's not like you owe me an answer, I just have no use for a wrong one.

If you want to discuss rocketry, get off your high horse and we can discuss it.

&gt;  Standardization matters only at low flightrates ... with several subvariants

We haven't heard of dozens of variants yet. And I also expect that there will be an advantage to one even larger than the largest variant. There always is. And that's why I don't expect any rocket ever to fly will all return to launch pad. Because it doesn't make sense to make a one off design for that one extra large payload.

It would have been real easy for you to say ""yep, I see that"". But instead no, you just go elliptical.

&gt; Implicit in your question was the assumption that a nontrivial number of such payloads need to be launched. If its only 1 or 2 a year out of hundreds of thousands of flights, then its easier for all involved to just land downrange and charge the customer a boatload of money for the inconvenience.

Which is what I said. Thanks. You had to quibble with my comment just to then agree with it. Bizarre.

You mean the chart which also lists per capita CO2 output? I don’t think that is nearly the slam dunk argument you think it is.

&gt;I disagree with the reference’s assessment, b/c it allows the EU to break itself up into parts. If that’s the case, then the US should also be fragmented to avoid counting its actual emissions. 

So you want these to be broken up by countries, yet not when it comes to America because that’s unfair to us because *reasons*? Way to be flagrant with your hypocrisy, my dude.

&gt;But hey, reasonable informed people can disagree without name calling. 

I 100% agree, I’m just not sure what that has to do with me since I haven’t called you any names.

&gt;In any assessment, China and India and Russia have the most centralized industrial sources of pollution. In the US, tailpipe emissions are the largest source. 

Cool.

&gt;Americans don’t have a choice. Rich people have prevented reasonable public transportation for over 100 years. 

I guess I hold myself and other Americans more responsible for their lack of action here than you, but that’s just me.

&gt;Meanwhile rich people are enriching themselves and birthing new billionaires in China and India by exploiting the earth and polluting at the nation state level

Because we are purchasing the products they produce without putting enough social or legislative pressure to prevent widespread environmental damage. 

&gt;It’s anti-American to criticize Americans for polluting when driving and to put them at an economic disadvantage to India and China, which are polluting on a continental scale and literally killing two oceans with carbon pollution that causes coral bleaching.

In no way, shape, or form is anything you described anti-American. Do you not understand the concept? What do you think “anti-American” means? Because I can, *and very much do*, levy the same critiques of carbon omissions against Australia and Canada.

From this conversation I'm beginning to suspect you struggle with the basics of rocket design. I'm trying to help with that, but theres only so much I can say here, pick up a copy of Rocket Propulsion Elements 

&gt;Haha. You get done telling me how valuable standardization is and now you say to just build a oneoff to save money! You aren't actually making any sense

1. Standardization matters only at low flightrates. Expendable rockets fly a couple times a year each, its obviously a problem if each is a unique configuration. If each individual variant flies thousands of times a year, then specialization makes sense. I expect dozens of variations of Starship, with different vehicle sizes and payload bay configurations, the same way there are dozens of different passenger aircraft each with several subvariants

2. Implicit in your question was the assumption that a nontrivial number of such payloads need to be launched. If its only 1 or 2 a year out of hundreds of thousands of flights, then its easier for all involved to just land downrange and charge the customer a boatload of money for the inconvenience. But if more than a couple percent of launches require that (or worse, if they require expendability ever), you've sized for the wrong market, and need to build bigger. Whether that means building a specialized variant thats big enough, or moving the entire fleet to a larger class, will depend on market trends and on how flexible the baseline vehicle is

&gt;Having only two stages certainly is a help. It's never made any sense from a rocket equation standpoint before. But maybe it's time now?

F9 is also 2 stages. But F9 S2 is like 20% the mass of the whole stack, vs more like 30% for Starship.

That said I think it's reasonable to assume that such a policy would inevitably over time produce higher payments and that would continue to weaken the need to work.

My issue is that Yang's claim that people will find other meaningful activities to do is naive and lacking in evidence\]. Survey data suggests that those who are unemployed have worse mental health, physical health outcomes, levels of happiness, and general report a lack of fulfillment. And that's data *controlling for financial distress*, so the money isn't the issue. Human beings require three things to live happy lives: A sense that what they're doing matters, that they're good at it, and they're able to be genuine in their lives. The first two require some form of work and human beings haven't found the recipe to divorce those needs from a physical workplace doing traditional productive work yet.

Someday maybe we'll get those answers, but I'm deeply skeptical that Yang's response to that issue is anywhere near sufficient. His website as an example says: 'educate themselves, start businesses, be more creative, stay healthy, relocate for work, spend time with their children, take care of loved ones'. Three of those (education, creativity, and health) don't fill the need to be productive at all, and the others come nowhere close to applying to everyone as not everyone wants kids, has to/wants to care for family, and starting a business is surely not for everyone. 

So I think he's selling snake oil as a solution to a future where fewer people work. We need to address the risk of automation happening, and UBI is absolutely not the answer to that.

[],hitemlow,,,[],,,,text,t2_au0zm,False,[],"&gt; above inflation payrise

That doesn't mean they were raised in correlation with the increase in expenses, though. If minimum wage goes up $7.75 and you were making $14.50 (double minimum wage), an equal raise would be increasing your wages by $15.50. Except the companies probably only raised wages $3. So the employees went from being worth 2 unskilled laborers to being worth 1.15 unskilled laborer. 

And the $3 raise is still an ""over inflation raise"", while also devaluing the labor of the skilled workers. So while yes, they are making more gross income, by the time you factor in the increased costs they're going to have by having to compete for the same goods that the previously unskilled labor was unable to afford (but now can with their newfound buying power), they very well could have a net loss. 


Now this is entirely dependent on how the employers respond to the increase in the minimum wage, but I would venture to say that most companies would not increase wages in correlation. Some companies that have their revenue controlled by contracts that are set years in advance may not be able to absorb a significant increase in wages. which could lead to some new and innovative ways to reduce costs without reducing quality. But will most likely result in outsourcing, automation, reduced quality or working conditions, or even in the business being forced to close down.

It sounds like we agree though that the material value of type of labor is skewed, meaning the issue is with capitalism and not that men and women are better at different things, or roles.  It feels from my view that stripping sexes of their differences in preference will create temporary happiness from wealth but will be unpredictable in it's effect if/when automation eliminates the vast majority of the STEM field and the economy is completely restructured due to a lack of human work.

Also, small nitpick, while I appreciate philosophy as import, it is not rooted in fact and it is not a science.  Philosophers say a lot of things, that doesn't make it fact.  So passing some ideas from philosophy as how the world does or should work doesn't hold much weight.

I also disagree that if differences in choice are biological that we should mold biology to fit our culture.  Instead we should mold our culture to fit biology in order to create equality.

Abstract

It is widely believed that vehicle automation will change how travelers perceive the value of travel time (VoTT), but the magnitude of this effect is still unknown. This study investigates how highly automated vehicles (AVs) may affect VoTT, using an existing mode—ridehailing services (RHS)—as an analogy for AVs. Both AVs and RHS relieve travelers from the effort of driving and allow them to participate in other activities while traveling. In a stated choice experiment, respondents chose between driving a personal vehicle or taking an RHS, with each mode characterized by a cost and travel time. Analysis results using a mixed logit model indicated that the VoTT was 13% lower when being driven in an RHS than when driving a personal car. We also told half the respondents (randomly selected) that the RHS was driverless; and for half (also randomly selected) we explicitly mentioned the ability to multitask while traveling in an RHS. Mentioning multitasking explicitly led to a much lower VoTT, approximately half that of driving oneself. However, the VoTT in a driverless RHS was 15% higher than when driving a personal car, which may reflect a lack of familiarity and comfort with driverless technology at present. These results suggest sizable reductions in VoTT for travel in future AVs, and point to the need for caution in making forecasts based on consumers’ current perceptions of AV technology.",1568670601,{},f0k575i,True,t3_d578c1,False,True,t3_d578c1,/r/science/comments/d578c1/americans_would_rather_drive_themselves_to_work/f0k575i/,1568670602.0,1,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consider a society that advances a little beyond where we're now, reaching near-full automation of life support processes meaning agriculture, food suppliers, resources, civil infrastructure etc.

In this scenario, which we should technically be going towards (or which we're going towards regardless of what we should be doing), your population has a larger percentage of its numbers available to specialize in all these fields related to, broadly speaking, ""Advancement"". This can be science or exploration or philosophy or what have you.

This allows you to have 5 people who become Einstein, and maybe one of them becomes super-Einstein. 

Excellence doesn't need to be unique or rare, I believe the human race advanced as slowly as it did simply because the sample size from which these people are drawn, and the ability of society and the zeitgeist to provide support and the circumstances for them to bring their contribution to mankind, were statistically limited.

To sum up, I think that as society advances, it actually has the potential for even further super-specialization, which can help accelerate its development even further. What you are saying, regarding versatility, I believe applies more to the transition period coming up to an age of automation.

I think versatility leads to other benefits towards society and makes those people lead arguably ""better"" or ""happier"" lives, but specialization is still the way towards progress.

They never exceed *c,* which is a constant. That's why there's important physics there. If it actually exceeded *c*, it would be an absolute revolution in physics, on the order of Einstein's supersession of Newton, or Darwin's supersession of Laplace.

As somebody else put it beautifully, the speed of light through a vacuum is 186K miles per second. The speed of light through water is 75% of that. Water and vacuum are the different media (with due caveats concerning whether the vacuum is a medium). Cherenkov radiation exceeds the 75%, but it doesn't exceed 100%, and the same is true here (with different values). These GRBs exceed *x*% of *c*, where *x%* is the speed attainable by light in that medium. They can never exceed x&gt;100%.

In other words, and this is simplified, the term 'speed of light' is a popsci term that is leading people down the garden path.

*c* is a number. It's the maximum magnitude of a vector whose travel is restricted to space. It has nothing to do with light, other than that light is one of the things whose motion is apposite to the subject.

[],Capn_Mission,,,[],,,,text,t2_8l4aa,False,[],"&gt;Metal is the closest of all contemporary genres to classical music.

While the above isn't a sentence I would ever type out in a public forum, I suppose one could argue for the truth of that statement by focusing on complex metal subgenres (e.g. prog metal, death metal) while ignoring the less complex metal subgenres (e.g. metalcore, sludge/doom metal, thrash). 

One could compare the complexity of prog metal to the more complex examples of formal western music. One could also symponic metal to the music of the romantic composers.

That being said, there is a level of subtlety in most western formal music that is completely lacking in metal. Even ""Bach rockers"" like Yngwie Malmsteen seem to have zero interest in the subtle aspects of classical music. While a sheet music transcription of Yngwie's music might look quite similar to that of sheet music of the baroque era, his approach to playing those notes is as far from classical as you can get.

What other contemporary genres (let's assume the commenter above was limiting those to things like soul, country, hip hop, rock, pop, etc.) are more like classical than metal? I suppose prog rock is probably just as much like classical as certain metal subgenres. Some ""new age"" artists also have similarities with some forms of classical music. Some of Yanni's music has similarities with romantic compositions. Ludovico Einaudi could also be compared with classical music.

There are number of classical guitar players that create music that is quite reminiscent of the baroque style. However, the commenter above may not have been familiar with those artists.

Popular orchestral music from film scores (think John Williams) is probably closer to classical music than metal is to classical music.

With lower prices, consumer have more money to spend on other stuff (on industries that already existed), so companies in those other industries will hire more workers to produce more.

According to the resource model, ego depletion is due to an actual physical depletion of a substrate. Usually, this substrate is taken to be glucose. However, this is problematic on several grounds. First, mental effort doesn't really require much extra glucose. At rest, the brain spends about the same amount of energy as when you're engaged in mental effort. Also, studies have found that you can pay participants to persevere. What kind of physical substrate can be magically restored by money? Even just reframing the task is enough to negate the ego depletion effect. Again, this would be weird if we were to believe the resource model. If your car is out of fuel, you can't incentivize it to keep going.

So, what's going on?

It's likely due to an interaction between *shifting priorities* and *valuation*.

Opportunity cost can promote task disengagement. When you're engaged in a certain activity, you might be losing out on opportunities. Let's take studying for instance. Instead you could be socializing, gaming, eating, or otherwise have a good time. This means the act of studying, in the short run, is costly. Which means that you would have a problem of competing priorities.

There's also the issue of value. The vmPFC can be thought of as a global valuation center. To make a choice, you simply choose the one valued most highly. So rather than thinking of willpower as a battle between expensive control (plans and effort) and cheap automation (impulses and habits), you can think of it as the result of processing and comparing choices. When you're hungry, the value of eating increases. So you will get distracted. When you have a tooth ache, the value of getting rid of the source of the pain increases. Again, you get distracted.

So it's less the expenditure of a resource, and more a process of calculation. It's worth to remember that evolution optimizes behavior.

Yes, but metal sources don't jump from one category to the other. There are millions of little steps in between. And with a change in certain key variables, any given deposit, formation, or potential source for minerals can be pushed up or down in these categories.

These include, importantly; extraction technology, availability/cost of energy, and current price for said metal.

Let's say the price of gold jumped to $1,000,000 overnight. Extracting it from sea water might suddenly become worthwhile (wouldn't know).

Or someone invents a brilliant method by which to easily extract gold from water. Maybe, then, we start mining sea water?

Or perhaps power becomes more abundant. We can now use inefficient methods to extra gold and still turn a profit?

This is an extreme example, but the idea is real and applicable.

The reality is that we're constantly inventing new technologies, constantly adding more power generation (solar is coming on hard), and demand for resources is constantly rising. So all three variables are *slowly* pushing in the right direction, in unison.

Typically a ""roughing pump"" is used to get to ""rough vacuum"" which is about 1x10\^-3 torr.  There are various kinds of roughing pumps, generally broken into two categories, a wet pump and dry pump.  A wet pump has an oil seal that allows you to have no valve between the rough pump and chamber, a dry pump has no seal and must have a valve to maintain vacuum when shut off.  An easy way to consider these pumps are like a high powered vacuum, they suck the gases out of the chamber.  Diaphram, screw, rotary vane, dryscroll, triscroll, are all types of roughing pumps.

A high vacuum pump is used to reach higher vacuum (lower pressures) generally to the 1x10\^-6 to \^-11 in ultra high vacuum situations.  The most common pump types are a turbo pump or a cryogenic pump.  The turbo pump works by having a turbine rotating at 60,000rpm that essentially catches the molecules bouncing around (as at these vacuum levels there is no more flow) and pushes them out through the turbo pump.  A cryo pump works by using compressed helium to cool itself to around 10-15 Kelvin and as gas molecules bounce into the cryo pump they are literally frozen inside the pump.  

If you're looking for more information feel free to ask and I can give more details.  If you want to look into it yourself you can check out some popular manufacturers (where I purchase these pumps from) such as:

I think we are all getting confused, partly because you are using standard nomenclature in non-standard ways.

You are trying to make a distinction between ""oligonucleotides"" and ""endogenous DNA"" as if oligonucleotides are always synthetic and somehow fundamentally different from in-vivo enzymatically synthesized DNA. That is not the case.

The chemical structures of all the nucleotides are very well-established by multiple independent lines of evidence. Do not fall into a vitalist trap.

Z-DNA exists transiently in nature. The Z-form is normally not stable enough to isolate and put it in a bottle.

There is no difference between nucleosides synthesised in a cell versus those made in a round bottomed flask.  

That may be the case for nucleosides which is what I am trying to ascertain. I have my doubts with regards to oligonucleotides being the same as endogenous DNA. It seems peculiar to me that forms such of Z-DNA have only been observed in oligonucleotides (automation of oligonucleotide synthesis began in the 1970s, Z-DNA first discovered in 1979).    
     
I am unable to access the papers you presented and cannot determine the origin of the molecules they are solving. I did go ahead and purchase access to the last one which piqued my interest:    
     
""In deducing the structure of DNA it is not at present possible to use a method in which the observed diffraction is used to refine an initially rough model of the structure. This is because DNA gives only a 'fibre diagram' in which some spots overlap, and in which large-angle diffraction is very weak. It is therefore impossible to obtain directly the coordinates of atoms in the molecule; one must combine X-ray diffraction analysis with a study of the stereochemistry. The method adopted is to build a molecular model in which certain sub-units are assumed to have structures which are fixed within narrow limits, and to vary the way in which the units are oriented relative to each other. A Fourier transform is calculated from the model and compared with the observed diffraction; discrepancies are then progressively reduced by changing the configuration of the model and studying the way in which the Fourier transform changes. It will be seen that if all bond lengths and angles were assumed to be variable the task of refining the structure would be extremely tedious. It is therefore far more important than it is in a normal crystal-structure determination to have accurate prior knowledge of bond lengths and angles in the sub-units.""  
     
The author goes on to use derivatives of Purines to attempt to determine their structure – not nucleosides synthesised de novo.

,dsf900,,,[],,,,text,t2_hvf9e,,,"The answer is that a single transistor failure can bring down an entire computer. However, modern consumer electronics are remarkably stable and robust, as long as they're not overheated. A major part of electronics manufacturing (especially processor manufacturing at Intel and AMD) is verification and quality control. Chips are extensively tested before they're sent to market, and anything that looks bad or borderline is trashed. There are a lot of physical indicators that chip makers can use to determine whether a processor is functioning normally and to predict future failures, such as the resistance through different paths in a chip. Chip manufacturers also practice ""binning"", which is when high quality chips and lower quality chips are separated and sold as different products. High quality chips have really good physical performance and can be run at high clock speeds and cope with higher temperatures, while lower quality chips may have borderline performance and the manufacturer limits them to slower clock speeds to ensure that they don't get close to a possible failure zone.

&amp;#x200B;

Also consider that computer hardware doesn't generally need to last forever, it just needs to last until it's considered obsolete and replaced. Most people replace their electronics after three or five or seven years just because they start to get slow or the battery life becomes terrible or the device gets damaged. Even on the resale market very few people want and are going to buy electronics that are 5+ years old. 

&amp;#x200B;

In applications where reliability is necessary, often called ""safety-critical"" applications, there are different techniques for dealing with hardware failures. If someone's life depends on the correct operation of a computer then it's not unusual to replicate that machine three or four times and have the group of computers ""vote"" on what is the right thing to do- this technique has been used in commercial aviation and manned spaceflight for a long time. For less demanding applications it's possible to design systems to ""fail safe"" so that even if the computer unexpectedly stops working the system stops or shuts down gracefully instead of becoming uncontrolled. For something like industrial automation and robotics you might have a main power hub that is continuously kept alive through repeated signals from the computer, so that if those signals ever stop then the system automatically cuts power and brings the entire system to a stop.

&amp;#x200B;

 Hardware can fail for many reasons, not just random transistor failure. It's possible for stray radiation to randomly flip bits of memory (this is especially problematic in space). Loose cables or connections can also cause data corruption. A weak point in chip manufacture can leak current from one circuit to another at unpredictable times, especially at high voltage and high frequency operation, etc. There are lots of reasons to guard against hardware failures, and the general field concerned with such computing is called ""[fault-tolerant computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault-tolerant_computer_system)"". A more specific subfield of software engineering that often deals with safety-critical systems is called ""[real-time computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)"", because they historically  have dealt with computer systems that interact with the real world (the computer system must keep up with the real world in ""real-time"", because the physical world keeps evolving regardless of whether or not the computer is ready). Safety and fault tolerance is often a concern in ""[cyber-physical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system)"" research for similar reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes hardware devices have redundancy built in. Physical hard drives have had the capability to identify and stop using ""bad sectors"", regions of the magnetic platter that no longer behave properly, for a long time now. Newer solid state drives can have bad sectors as well, and similarly identify and stop using that region of memory. RAM modules can have Error Correcting Codes (ECC) built in, which allows the hardware to identify and fix many simple and some more complex hardware faults. Whole processors usually do not have redundancy built in, but the technique of whole-machine replication can be used to provide this if you really need it. Moreover, there are lots of software redundancy mechanisms that will hopefully give you an idea of how healthy your computer is before something goes wrong. Lots of tools exist to check processor correctness as well as memory and disk consistency. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I can tell you from experience that hardware can and does randomly fail. Electronics manufacturers are getting exceedingly good at quality control, even compared to just ten or twenty years ago. If you work in computer support you will see failures like this happen all the time, but for individual consumers you're unlikely to see frequent failures. I personally have had memory, processors, and video cards all just stop working for no apparent reason, but the last time this happened to me was in 2008 or 2009.

We have different screws drives for different applications, not because of competing standards. In fact union rules have more effect on screw selection than competing standards! 

A hexhead does not compete with phillips. A slot head does not compete with pozidrive etc. Admittedly there are some competing standards such as JIS version of Phillips.

Designers pick the drive type based on the application, they consider:

Accessibility, torque limit, cam-out, human or machine driven, tamper resistance, aesthetics, how often its removed, clamp load and unions (not kidding).

A head stud bolt in a car uses a 12 point head because of the high drive torque &amp; accuracy of the torque.

A slot head is common for small applications with minimal torque. It also allows for ""tool-less"" removal. You don't need a slot screwdriver, you can use a butter knife or a dime etc... 

If you think I'm bullshitting on the butter-knife aspect... well I got one more for you:

The big auto manufacturers in the US are all unionized. Union rules determines who does what job. One such rule (paraphrased) is that if certain mechanical tools are required, then a certain union worker must do the work. Example; the heat exchanger for the hydraulic pumps in a big plant requires periodic changeout of the filter. This is done by removing bolts to get to a filter. Bolts require wrenches which means a union maintenance person (millwright maybe?) must do the work.

Eye nuts can be unscrewed with just a bar. Poke it thru the hole of the eye nut and start turning. A simple bar is not a ""mechanical tool"" and thus now you can use cheap labor and not a union-tradeperson.

Accessibility and aesthetics play a larger role than you'd think. You can't have a flush surface mounted hex head bolt or 12-point. Which is where torx or robertson/square is often used. The torx allows for higher &amp; accurate torque, while robertson/square can rest in the drive bit. You can pickup a robertson/square screw and stick it into your screwdriver, it will stay there. While a torx/phillips/slot will not. This is very important in automation.

Now there is a LOT of automation keeping the grid running on a daily basis, but there is equally a lot that goes wrong and a lot that requires human intervention even under normal circumstances. To start, there is a wrench thrown in off the very start, with people dead there is a large unpredicted demand shift as people stop using power. Not all demand is gone, lights will remain on and running motors will keep going, but a lot will stop. This alone wouldn't be good for the grid, and now we have no humans to manage it. The grid needs to always match power demand to power production, maintain voltage, and maintain frequency. If any of these start going wildly out of line, we have automatic systems to shut things down for safety reasons. The various control system in the transmission and generation of the grid can react themselves, but these systems left to their own devices, with a large demand shift, and no humans to operate the plants of make large scale system shifts would almost certainly fail within a day tops. All it takes is one failure in one places to start throwing things out of control and unchecked that could take down entire grids. And an entire grid is a vast area, usually spanning large chunks if not entire continents. with a vast amount of failure points. We even had small issues propagate and take down large chunks of grids even with humans working to operate it. [In 2003 a small bug that failed to alert operators that they needed to react to something took down power for 55 million people in Canada and the US for days.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003)


And ignoring grid stability, which i'm sure would run into failures within hours, there many long term barriers too. Generators need maintenance, power lines and transformers get damaged and need repairs, coal plants will simply run out of coal in the boilers, etc. There is no way it could come anywhere close to a year.


However, to the credit of the movie writers, I'm sure they didn't overlook this, but rather it was implied they were running a diesel standby generator at their house. So long as you didn't run out of diesel, and you had more than one generator or knew how to maintain and repair them, you could run this for some time. However, that leads to a fault a lot of writers DO overlook. Diesel only last about a year at best, and that's if you store it properly. Gasoline is not better. Fuel additives you could find might stretch it for a bit longer than a year. So unless you're making your own diesel, even a small generator is going to be hard to stretch much over a year.

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609556/lawyer-bots-are-shaking-up-jobs/

Now, it's quite likely that the first generation of bots are probably quite crappy.   But it's important to understand what automation replacing humans often looks like.  There's a very human tendency to: a) think that whatever you do must be inherently difficult, (call this ego) b) to develop an opinion about technology based solely on their first exposure to it and just... never change their mind no matter how things change or what new evidence emerges, and c) latch on to anecdotes while ignoring more robust data.

In terms of automation, these tendencies often mean that if you asked a lawyer if their job is in danger they will likely say: ""Computers could never do what I do! Did you see IBM Watson on Jeopardy?  Sure it gets a lot of questions right but then it says something bizarre and super weird! You could never do that as a lawyer! Plus, my friend down at firm X says they started playing with bots and they would routinely mess stuff up!""

However, in reality, automation happens organically over time.  We may often hold in our minds the idea that lawyers are people that go into courtrooms and use abstract rhetoric and argument theory to do their job.  And let's assume for a moment that a bot could never do this (though I definitely wouldn't bet on that).  The reality is that lawyers only spend a tiny fraction of their time in the courtroom, many don't go into the courtroom at all.  If you actually broke down how they spend their time it'd be a lot of going through documents, a lot of filing of documents, a lot of collating documents and so on.  All things that ARE very automatable.  So the way automation creeps in is not by, suddenly overnight replacing lawyers, but instead by, piece-by-piece, taking responsibility for more and more of those tasks that take up a lawyer's time.  Now, for a lawyer this is great, that means they spend less time doing the mind-numbing stuff and more time in the abstract/""soft skills"" stuff like gladhanding, negotiating and being in the courtroom.  So that lawyer isn't replaced, however, because he/she has more time to allocate to that stuff, you NEED LESS LAWYERS.  And that's the rub.  What you end up with is jobs where the non-automatable stuff becomes increasingly concentrated and just less people with that job.

So the path to automation isn't by making an all knowing lawyer-bot that replaces the full responsibility of a lawyer, but rather to take the tasks that are relatively easy for a computer to do off a lawyer's plate and give them free time to focus on the stuff that computers can't do.  This process requires less lawyers and IS ALWAYS ADVANCING.  What was once considered impossible for a computer to do, like say fill out and file a document, is now very easy for a computer to do but something like ""summarize this 1,000 page document"" is considered very hard... but as we know based on the bots on reddit, that IS getting easier for a computer.  So it's a moving goal post.

The final point is that people generally have a very poor notion of what computer can do and not very honest assessments of what most of their job entails.  There is a world's difference between a Turing-test-passing bot (i.e. a bot that can hold a believable conversation) and a true conscious AI; we are very quickly closing in on the former but nowhere near the latter.  However, it's alarming how few people realize that a Turing-test-passing bot is reeeaaaallllyyyy all that is needed to do most of their jobs; a bot that can grab key points out of a conversation and say the right things back is really a lot of a lot of jobs.  Again, maybe there really are some tasks it can't do, but if those tasks only take up a fraction of your total time then people with your job title won't go away, but there will be a lot less job offers for them because less are needed.  But the most common job in the US for women is ""secretary"" and the most common for men is ""truck driver"".  And anyone who thinks either of those jobs can't be heavily automated is dangerously kidding themselves.  Though expect the ""but trucking will always need humans somewhere!"" or ""did you see Google's car got in an accident last week!"" comments.

So, are lawyer bots going to replace lawyers in the near future?  Probably not.  Are lawyer bots going to lead to a requirement of less lawyers who spend a larger fraction of their time on the ""soft skills"" stuff? Expect it.  In general, one shouldn't ask if 100% of a job's responsibilities can be automated, but rather can a substantial fraction of it be such that consolidation of personnel can occur.",1525679418,,dykqwu3,False,t3_7yv6t6,,True,t3_7yv6t6,/r/askscience/comments/7yv6t6/how_soon_can_we_expect_that_ai_will_start_taking/dykqwu3/,1527172431.0,3,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,1525680100.0,,,,1395280255.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,6553534.0,,public,False,

I was thinking that such machines would split the CO2 molecules, and combine them with other molecules in Venus' atmosphere to make something that wasn't a greenhouse gas or a molecule that could get more easily carried by the solar wind.

Secondly I think saying that Mars has more water than Venus is largely unfounded. Venus has quite the thick atmosphere and 1.2% (got the number by changing ppm into a percent from Wikipedia) of it is water vapor. That's a lot of water. Unfortunetly, I couldn't find how much water Mars has so I can't rely compare them. Even if there's less water on Venus btw, there are sources of both Hydrogen and Oxygen molecules in the atmosphere so making more by utilizing Venus' atmosphere is plausible.

Lastly, if there's no way to chemically change Venus' atmosphere to make it to the liking of human's then the following could happen
1. Use the machines (which will be run using renewable energy) to reduce Venus' atmosphere
2. Use a new technology that we will use on Earth to stop the effect of Climate Change and then use that on Venus
In addition to this humans could utilize the elements in Venus's atmosphere, which are abundant do to its sheer size, to make an Earth atmosphere and then dispose of the rest.

Corporations are supposed to do what is in ""the best interests of their shareholders.""  This is pretty ambiguous, but generally the rule is more money is better than less money.  This gives corporations a lot of room in their decisions.  Sometimes, the way to use money (capital) is to invest in automation, which will lower your labor costs.  Sometimes, to give your people a raise, so you have the best workers (labor).  Sometimes, you buy a corporate jet, because you convince the board and your shareholders that is the best way to use the money.  Sometimes, you don't know what to do, so you give the money back to your shareholders.  They're happy, because the stock price goes up.  The board is happy because the sharholders are happy, so the CEO gets to keep his job.  The workers might not be happy, but sometimes they hold a lot of shares too.

I've always been attracted to magnetic confinement schemes. The inertial confinement method seem cumbersome to me.

But, even with all my poopooing on the idea, the ignition group are the only ones to have surpassed the break-even point on returns. So what do I know.

I most like the Helion Energy approach because they harness energy directly through the coils in the machine, and don't need to add additional processes and complications like driving steam turbines.

The newest Ethernet standards run at 25 or 50 Gbps per lane, requiring around 13 GHz of bandwidth, far more than the CPU clock frequency.

[],thereddaikon,,,[],,,,text,t2_6gopw,False,[],"They can make processors faster than 4ghz. Intel has an upcoming revision of the 9900k that should be able to boost all cores to 5ghz. Over a decade ago IBM made a transistor that ticked over 50ghz.

It isn't a question of whether it can be done, but if it's worth it. Raising clock speed incurs a lot of penalties elsewhere, primarily in power usage and heat generation. Heat generation is usually expressed as TDP in watts*. All other things being equal, if you raise the clock speed you will increase power draw and heat generation. This means you need beefier power delivery and cooling which increases costs and also feeds back more power draw and heat generation for the system as a whole. 

Heat and power aren't the only considerations though. When you really start to pump the clock speeds you can also run into signal integrity issues. The execution pipeline of a processor consists of many complex circuits that must operate in lock step. If anything were to get out of sync then you start to generate computational errors which will manifest as instability in software. Programs may behave erratically or outright crash. Maintaining signal integrity comes down to the design of the chip and also the fabrication process. This is one of the reasons why companies like Intel and TSMC spend billions of dollars on improving their fabrication techniques and shrinking the feature size. This is also why cooling is important in overclocking, as heat increases so does resistance to the point where it can threaten clock stability. 


Clock speed increases have slowed down, but not stopped, because fabrication processes are not improving at the same rate they once were. This was the easy solution to raising clock speeds. Every new process would usually shrink the feature size by half and allow for proportionally less voltage to run the processor. Moore's law is dead and has been for awhile now so while there are improvements in process tech it is slowing down. Intel originally planned to roll out their 10nm process in 2016. Today it has only been used in a few mobile chips.

I've been doing a lot of reading recently about this and have come across the question of projective representations of symmetry groups. This is my understanding so far: the Hilbert space has to support a representation of the symmetry group, except that the elements of the group can also be associated with an additional phase. (I've usually seen these notated as c(g1, g2).) These phases cannot be randomly picked since they have to in the end be consistent with the overall group structure, and this restricts possible choices for the final group that ends up being represented on the Hilbert space. In the example of SU(2), the phase picked up is of π after a rotation of 2π, hence the double-covering of SO(3). Would you say my understanding so far is correct?

I'm really interested in your last paragraph. Could you give some examples of quantum systems with SO(3) symmetry without spinor representations? Would a particle in a radially symmetric potential count?

As for the phone, I can almost guarantee that it was because of the wireless signals and not ergonomics.

Firstly, I used to carry my phones in my pockets for as long as I can remember, [even this absolute unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_K800i). I never had any problems.

The phone which was causing the problem was Elephone P6000. When I suspected that the wireless was the cause of the issue, I got an automation app that I set up to switch the phone into airplane mode for majority of time and only turn it off every 30 minutes for 1 minute (IIRC) to get updates. [Here's proof that I'm not making this up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/3b7trg/aeroplane_mode_automation/) While I was running with this setup, my hip didn't hurt. Eventually I got rid of it, because having the phone disabled for the majority of time just wasn't feasible and the pain returned. I ended up carrying the phone in the outermost pocket of my bag and that did the trick. 

Eventually, the phone broke and I got a Moto G5, which is basically the same size, just from a more reputable manufacturer. I often carry it in my pocket with no problems.

What I took from these experiences is, that while it is obviously possible to make wireless devices with negligible or no effect on humans, it's also very much possible to make them in a way which messed with me. I know science claims it shouldn't be possible. I also know it wouldn't be the first time scientists claimed something was safe only for it to turn out to be quite the opposite.

   * Use as a media center/player (especially before hardware decoders)
   * Use as a home NAS
   * Use as an emulation device
   * Use as a home PC replacement
* The same reasons why raspberries are so useful in our professional use also apply to hobby projects - because it's easy to develop for and there are lots of accessible hardware/software products that are offered for the pi.

[],NabiscoLobstrosity,,,[],,,,text,t2_li6i1,False,,"That's a great response, thanks! And I've been reading through the study methodology and it turns out that they addressed most of the audio sample issues I assumed would interfere - which is actually fairly impressive that they were able to go through that effort. From isolating breathing in 911 calls, to using a cellphone microphone and compressing their sleep lab audio down to the phonecall frequency range, they really tried to normalize the audio samples to get apples-to-apples comparisons. So kudos and it looks like a valid result. (Assuming complete honesty and they are'nt incorrectly implying that all data is the quality of just one or two samples. I normally wouldn't need to make this caveat, but I spent a few days debunking a series of climate change denial papers from political think-tanks that pretended their sponsored claims were legitimate studies. Those things went overboard with every bit of manipulation and deception you can imagine).

My subject area is the computer science field, I'm in the blurry overlap between academia and industry, mostly with software and automation. With regard to all your concerns about privacy and the ethics of a study - in the software and IoT domain the best way I can summarize it is ""those concerns are not a concern"". Really, they're not a thing. The data from the Apple Watch is almost certainly already being stored or analyzed to detect heart attacks already, and users sign away all privacy permissions. Even if you (literally) sit the person down, explain to them for half an hour the data that is collected and how extensively it is shared, and show them their data that has already been collected - they'll allow you to use and share that data. Microsoft's internal academics have done this - I'm not talking about disclaimers with clear terminology; the researchers really met with study participants at their house, with printouts of their location tracking info from the prior 4 weeks, and explained the data obfuscation methods - most participants chose the weakest obfuscation methods, if any at all. 

All the privacy concerns simply aren't a thing in IoT. It's not that the companies don't care to protect privacy (though many simply don't care, and exploit it for all it's worth) - the user's don't care either. They always pick based on convenience, features, and price rather than privacy. 

If the Amazon Echo asked ""will you allow us to study ambient sound to help medical research and to monitor for medical emergencies?"" then 95% of users would approve. Even if it said the data would only be used to study, and it wouldn't act automatically even if it detected a likely emergency, you'd probably get a 90% approval rate. 

The bandwidth issue isn't much of an issue; the device would probably collect a handful of audio samples that it sends to the main servers to establish a profile or fingerprint for the user's normal breathing, and the servers would send that back to the unit along with a set of markers which are likely if that user exhibits the breathing problems. That assumes the programmers aren't lazy (or forced to rush by management). If they are lazy or forced to rush, they'll just send the full audio back to Amazon, and hope they can figure it out later.",1561308373,{},erv7di0,False,t3_c3rqb0,False,True,t1_eruylop,/r/gadgets/comments/c3rqb0/this_cardiac_arrestdetecting_smart_speaker_could/erv7di0/,1561308374.0,1,True,,False,gadgets,t5_2qgzt,0.0,,,,1561454878.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can buy Hue switches that work exactly like any other switch. Switches that are installed permanently in the wall that look like any other switch, but unsurprisingly, you're again just speaking out of ignorance.

&gt;what do you use to block/replace/in place of/instead of/to prevent usage of/in addition to light switches in your house?

I'm not blocking anything, there's no non-Hue switch connected to the light outlets.

&gt;In another comment you said that I can get all kinds of switch (covers? replacements?), So what are my options because the only ones I can see are the ugly circle stick on thing, or the ugly 4 buttons in one square thing.

There's https://runlesswire.com/click_switch_for_philips_hue/ for instance. Also a couple here: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hue+light+switch&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2

I haven't really checked out the US market as it's not relevant to me, but I know I can get contacts that look identical to other modern contacts in Denmark like these: https://www.lampeguru.dk/niko-hue-kontakt-til-lk-kontakter.html

&gt;Do they work if the hub is down? You keep ignoring that part of the zwave stuff, and I'm curious what fallbacks are in place.

&gt;Also, how much does the hue system cost? I have about 17 circuits I have zwave enabled, and it cost me around $700 total from start to finish.

This sounds like it's turning into some childish religious where you want Zwave to win. You understand that's not what we're discussing here, right? I'm not trying to make Hue win, I just want it to be judged by its merits and not misunderstandings. If I knew anything about Zwave and misinformation was being spread about it, I'd also defend Zwave.

The point of automation is to reduce cost of labor.

If you were like me and had any experience with safety systems, you would know the first step is to do a hazard analysis of the risks. I've certainly not seen a formal hazard analysis regarding drones other than people spewing FUD. That's probably because a formal analysis would show the number of drones that are a) large enough to cause damage b) flown in a public airspace and c) operated incorrectly such that an accident actually occurs is essentially zero, and certainly less likely than a bird strike.
2. I personally do not own a drone, much less recorded video from a drone and posted it to youtube. My experience with drones is through friends or family flying on private property. Maybe keep your assumptions about me to yourself next time so that you don't look like an idiot.
3. Banning high fructose corn syrup would save several orders of magnitude more lives than registering drones. How come you aren't so gung-ho about those regulations? Is it possible that you have a bias in this discussion? My point about cereal went right over your head, so maybe take a moment and look up leading causes of mortality.

shit like this is a lose lose for platforms.

People will hate the shit out of this idea, but the current problem is that quality moderation is expensive/time consuming. We have to find a way of preventing specious reports *and* incentivize quality review.

Thats going to by default involve money. the only question is where is that money going to come from? some will say google should just absorb it as a cost of doing business, but I dont see that as realistic, not the least of the reasons being that how we got here(YT is notorious for poorly handling copyright claims imo)

a few years back I was the operator of a website where people posted content that voilated tos all the time like phone numbers etc, it caused an *amazing amount of support email. I got accused of supporting pedophilia for a few dollars of ad revenue. I eventually hit it like the fist of an angry god, implemented a filter that detected phone numbers, banned anyone that circumvented that filter.. it was exhausting to stamp out that behavior. It was a never ending problem.

I was detecting people using numbers, words instead of numbers etc.

users constantly wanted interactions moderated that happened *off of the site*

The point is that user generated content is a never ending fountain of work.

You can say ""hey if you want to profit off of it, that becomes your problem"". Yes it does, but capitalism is synonymous with minimum quality, not charity. There is no profit in it beyond the minimum. (see: this is how we got here)

Advertisements are a bit of a joke, especially with how common ad blocking software is.

Other examples exist of companies struggling with user generated content. League of legends and Tribunal for example.

Players demonstrated they hated tribunal because players actively defended abusive behavior, *if* the abusive behavior was coming from a ""good player""

**The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: The Untold Story of a Lost World, by Steve Brusatte** - Yeah I might have jumped slightly ahead of the book club, very interesting read though and I found the chapter on birds particularly enlightening. 

**No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump's Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need, by Naomi Klein** - Another interesting read, lot of stuff I already knew a fair bit about but the sections about disaster capitalism were pretty eye-opening and depressing, not that I didn't know that kind of stuff goes on but the sheer extent of corruption that followed recent natural disasters &amp; wars is pretty crazy. 

**A River in Darkness: One Man's Escape From North Korea, by Masaji Ishikawa** - Man this was a gut wrenching read in parts and very well written, the title emphasises his escape from North Korea but in reality the vast bulk of the book goes through his childhood in Japan, deportation to North Korea and then the decades of horror that he and his family had to live through for decades before he was able to escape. I somehow now have an even dimmer view of the North Korean dictatorship than I did going in to this book.. 

**Around the World in Eighty Days, by Jules Verne** - Some much needed light relief! Fun read that stokes my sense of adventure, not much more to say.

**Guns, Germs and Steel, by Jared Diamond** - This one's taken me a couple of months to finish because in spite of the overall theme and many of the individual topics being extremely interesting... there's a section about halfway through that's like 3 hours of going really in to the weeds about... well, seeds. Also, I get it, it all comes back to food production, you don't need to hammer me over the head with it every second page. Just in general I found there was a lot of unnecessary repetition which is somewhat surprising given that it's a pretty dense subject being covered in an already relatively short number of pages.

**Worth Dying For: The Power and Politics of Flags, by Tim Marshall** - Don't think this was half as good as Prisoners of Geography but still a worthwhile read. I just enjoy his writing style in general though so I'm looking forward to reading Divided and Shadowplay.

**WTF: What have we done? Why did it happen? How do we take back control?, by Robert Peston** - Goes a bit heavy on the self loathing at times (not entirely falsely, but 3 years after Brexit it's a point that's been thoroughly hammered home) but makes a lot of worthwhile points, I certainly find Peston more tolerable in print than on screen... The sections focused on social media, Grenfell, the education system and automation were particularly worth reading.

**Fascism: a warning, by Madeleine Albright** - Absorbing read so far, Albright's led a quite remarkable life and that bleeds in to the insight she imparts in this book, I'm up to chapter 10 and so far it's been fairly chronological going through from Mussolini up to Chavez. 

**Money Can't Buy Us Love: Everton in the 1960s, by Gavin Buckland** - This one will be of 0 interest to 99.99% of you and almost 0 interest to 99% of you but I'm an Everton fan so it's always a nice surprise when an actually decent book centered around the club is released, so far this is an excellent read.

In the same way *people* are pretty much obsolete.  The engineers that make/maintain the automation machines and their managers are the only ones with jobs *at all.* It's basically a stratified society where only that small elite have a place.

Everyone else that isn't an engineer is just maintained on a sort of super high-powered UBI.  Everything they want or need is just given to them.  But they have literally nothing to do and no purpose.  

Because of this post-scarcity system where everyone is just provided for, a lot of people who don't get the book think it's a treatise in favor of socialism.  It's actually exactly the opposite.  The central character is loosely involved in a revolution *against* that system. The central message basically being anti-automation, but from the standpoint that human beings need something to *do* to give us a sense of purpose.  That sitting around doing nothing while all of our needs are just met would leave us empty and hollow.

People often mistake Vonnegut's message for political/enonomic when it's more often than not technological.  As he put it himself, his central theme tends to be ""the inhumanity of some of man's inventions to man.""

[],AmoralNiceGuy,,,[],,,,text,t2_128wld,False,,"&gt; I'm not looking at one metric. 

You only quoted one metric in the previous comment, so I addressed it and its implied narrow view.  If you wanted to be seen as having a more robust argument you are going to have to put in the time and type out the other metrics you think will support your argument.  I can't read your mind.  Thing is, I know too many people who ONLY look at rate of employment and GDP and indicators of economic health to given anybody the benefit of the doubt anymore.

&gt; Wages have been rising all over the world. 

Wages ARE rising when looking at a *global average*.  They are NOT rising in every country in the world.  In the US, for instance, they are falling, particularly in relation to cost of living.  Why are they falling?  Automation, off-shoring, and illegal workers... the most important and devastating of which will be automation with in the next 20 years.  This is what I have been talking about from the beginning, automation.  So when you ask...

&gt;  Jobs in wealthy countries are going to poorer countries. Is that a bad thing? 

My primary response is ""You are getting off topic.""  My secondary answer is that I am an amoralist (moral nihilist) so I see nothing as intrinsically evil or bad, just undesirable.  What I find undesirable about the *actuality* of jobs going from wealth countries to poorer countries is two fold.  One, the wages in those countries are often a very small portion of what they would be in this country, yet we the consumer see no savings on the back end.  While this may grow a 3rd world nation's economy slightly, the biggest winners (by far) out of this situation is the corporation.  Not the workers who often work in horrible conditions at comparatively slave wages and not us the consumer (so don't go acting like offshoring is some kind of humanitarian effort).  Why is the corporation making so much money an undesirable thing?  By itself, nothing.  But it is one behavior in a larger behavioral model (the international corporate model) that makes one think that they have zero loyalty to anyone and when the time comes to automate everything (to save a slight margin), they will not hesitate to leave those 3rd world workers or us in the dust.

&gt; And yet real household income is still increasing in those wealthy countries. 

I'm going to need sources on that one.  Also, household income is a little bit of a red herring. Households have slowly been moving from single income to duel income (and fewer kids) for the last 5 decades (due to women entering the workforce).  So there are other things going into the increase of HOUSEHOLD income, even while individual worker income is stagnating or falling behind cost-of-living.

&gt; The quality of life in those countries is increasing with technology. 

This I agree with, but does, in no way, refute my central argument that advanced AI will be able to take and likely will take most jobs that exist now in the next 20 years.  Could their be new kinds of jobs to work at that time?  Sure, but there is almost a guaranty that AI will be able to do those jobs too.

&gt; You'll find a 1960s lifestyle quite affordable if you reduce your living  space by 50%, give up all your modern conveniences, and accept drastically less safety built in to everything you own.  

Won't matter for shit if you don't have a job to support even that level of lifestyle.  And there are certain ""modern conveniences"" that are a requirement for certain kinds of work.  I, for instance, and been asked in interviews if I had a smart phone and could easily be contacted via it.  Also, space in home can be a money maker in itself.  We got a larger place knowing we could rent out rooms and grow some of our own food in a large back yard.  All in all we are ahead because of such choices, but we could not have been able to make that choice if we (as individuals) made less to begin with.  Many others cannot even make that choice even if they wanted to because of horrible wages.

&gt; The irony of a youtuber talking about technology taking jobs is delicious. 

A. Even if it was ironic, which it isn't (and will tell you why in a moment), this is in no way an argument for why they might be incorrect.  At best this is an ad hominim, at worst, a non-sequitur

B. This youtuber is not cautioning people about the dangers of ALL technology taking jobs.  He is talking about Advanced General AI specifically as it is looking like it will shape up to be a complete game changer in the job market.  Reducing this discussion to ""technology"" is a ridiculous reduction that I can only imagine was made in bad faith to prop up some 'irony' burn that holds no water without it.

[],AmoralNiceGuy,,,[],,,,text,t2_128wld,False,,"Rate of employment is only one metric to determine the health of the economics of the working classes.  Other metrics that look DIRECTLY at the health of the labor market are... where wages fall in a historical context when adjusted for [inflation/cost-of-living], quality of employment, work place conditions, availability of desired jobs, time spent at one job, average hours worked, percentage of GPD sub-managment employees make in a nation, needed education and job requirement inflation.  All of these metrics paint a much less rosy picture than the ONE metric you decided to focus on.  A metric that means nothing if people are not making a living wage in said employment.  Take, as a possibility, that our employment reaches 100% (all able bodied adults are working full time), but people are making slave wages and working in sweat shop conditions.  Would rate of employment really mean that much anymore or can you accept that that is only one small piece of a much larger picture?

And at any rate, I did not say the total number of jobs are going down yet.  I, from the beginning, have been stating that the effect to date has been wage suppression (due, in fact, to 3 major factors: offshoring, automation, and illegal workers).  If people did start to demand a living wage, however, I believe the free market capitalists when they say, ""That will do no go for you because we will just automate your job as it will be cheaper to do so at that point.""  These words are not the idle musings of armchair technologists, these are threats that have been acted upon in many large corporations already (and I helped develop some of those automated systems).  So people are working, but the wage ceiling for the working classes is falling.  On that day that automating a job is cheaper than the minimum wage people are willing to do a job is the day a company will automate it.  That day is coming for SO MANY JOBS.  

Listen, I know the buggy whip argument and the whole Luddite ""Machines are taking our jerbs!"" meme, and the ""this time is different"" has been said before argument, but it really is different this time.  As someone who, designs (non-intelligent) job automation systems and really keeps up with AI (as it is a passion of mine) I see a very real possibility that within 20 years, there will be no physical or mental task that a human can do that a robot will not be able to do better or cheaper (at the very least 80% of all possible tasks).  Even if you want to divorce the conversation from what kind of impact this will have on the job market, human level general AI is coming and right soon.  We MUST be ready for its impacts no matter what spheres they may be in.

Also, your response is incredibly low effort and makes no attempt to validate its position. You are simply stating a flat belief and using one figure as proof in a very complex situation.  Also calling something a fear does not mean it does not accurately reflect reality.

[],AmoralNiceGuy,,,[],,,,text,t2_128wld,False,,"&gt; Of course they have, inflation is a measure of the change in prices.  

Yes and no.  Inflation is the measure of the change in price of a specific set of products (many of which people do not even buy anymore) called a 'basket'.  At one time this basket MIGHT have been representative of the economy as a whole but more and more seems to be departing from said function.  Take for instance the fact that ""cost of living"" is generally accepted to be outpacing inflation.  How can this be if inflation is an accurate indicator of the change in the price of things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I just don't see why the masses would sit in the cold and starve instead of building shelter and growing food. 

Why did the French sit in the cold and starve prior to the French Revolution?  Why, given the economic situation in France today, did the people not rise up sooner?  Why have so many other peoples throughout history let things get to that point (for a while is some cases) before saying enough is enough?  There are a few reasons:

1. Fear of the rich and powerful's military
2. Some misguided sense of loyalty to one's nation/soverign
3. A belief that this is their lot in life, probably ordained by God, and it is their moral duty to suffer through it (I know may modern Christians that think this way and they make up \~85-93% of the population)
4. A belief in a just world and thus the idea that they only have what they have because they have not worked hard or smart enough to deserve more.  This is perhaps the strongest psychological aspect that I think will take the modern US into the kind of situation I am thinking of.  Partly because most people have NO idea how far automation and AI has gotten and otherwise the talking heads that most people listen to are still telling people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps
5. convenience and economy (mostly only applies today) but this might have been thought of choosing the devil you do know over the devil you do not in years past.  I know being cold and hungry is not convenient, but there are plenty of examples of people not being motivated by these things because of the possible outcomes of trying to change things both in the past and present.

Now, if we, the people (and a majority of us at that), started learning how to do those things without the aid of the R&amp;P (via their goods and services), and we start transitioning away from this centralized economy NOW, then I think we could do as you say.  We have the time, cultural stability, and resources to make that happen.  However, we probably will not have those things in 20 years if the economy continues on this current trend.  As stated before, the R&amp;P and the common man are currently employing two different strategies.  

&amp;#x200B;

The R&amp;P are charging the absolute most they can for goods as services (while still undercutting the small time competition) and creating artificial scarcity.  How are they creating artificial scarcity?  About 10 years ago banks used to get empty properties off their books as fast as possible because they saw them as a loss due to taxes, upkeep, and such (I should know, I used to be a flipper back then and I got some great deals from banks around New Years because of this).  Today, they let them sit empty because those houses are more valuable (in the long term) off the market.  It creates scarcity and should their current business model start to fail or they need additional revenue streams they will start renting them out.  Scarcity means higher prices for houses, which means larger loans.  There are millions of homeless people out there that could be using those millions of houses, but keeping them empty is better than selling at fair market price, so they stay empty.  Due to this many people can't afford to by a home, so they rent.  Rent is just like burning money for the renter as they will have nothing to show for it at the end, but they cannot afford to buy so that is what they do.

&amp;#x200B;

We, the common man, rent, and shop at Walmart, and take out loans for education, and homes, and cars, and health care because we cannot afford to do otherwise.  This, more and more, is putting us in a place where we will not have the resources to cast aside the R&amp;P when the time comes.  Where will we build these houses?  On who's land?  With what resources and how will you get them there?  And with who's labor?  Are YOU able to monetarily and logistically source all of these things by yourself?  Do you think the vast majority of millennials can?  Now multiply it by 300 million.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us take, for instance, that 80% of the US population live in urban areas (per the US census).  That means 80% of the people live where very little food can be grown.  Why not truck it in?  Because just like the food industry, the logistics industry is being consolidated and driverless semis are only going to hasten that trend.  How many trucks that DO NOT belong to the R&amp;P will be available to feed this 320 million urban population (assuming 400 million in the US in 20 years).  Corporations are already pushing for the idea that ""cars as a service"" will replace all but the most rural of car ownership.  Why not build vertical indoor gardens in warehouses.  Well, you have to find an available warehouse.  This can be done now, but in 20 years?  Remember, the banks are sitting on empty properties waiting for people to get desperate enough?  Not to mention the amount of capital needed to start one of those is ridiculous.  Even if you ARE able to source 90% of your necessities, if you have to go to the R&amp;P for the other 10%, they will gouge us if we try to turn our collective backs on them.  Not out of spite, but out of want for profit and luxury.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You don't need to be hired by a  rich person for your labor to be valuable.

It does if the R&amp;P are the only ones with the stuff you want/need to buy.

Please excuse the length.  It may seem like a simple issue, but requires a lot of build to explain convincingly.  I do not know what country you live in but I can make an analogy by extension if you are familiar with the economic situation in the USA.

&amp;#x200B;

In the US, wages have largely be stagnating for the last 3 to 4 decades (when adjusted for \[inflation/cost of living\] they are losing ground.  Why?  Is it because workers have become less productive?  No, individual workers on average are MUCH more productive than they were 30 years ago.  Is it because companies cannot sell goods and services for as much as they used to?  Nope, prices on most good have kept up with inflation and it some cases (housing, education, cars, healthcare, etc.) the prices have far exceeded what they would be if simply adjusted for inflation.  Is the workforce less educated than they were 30 years ago?  No, in fact, they are far MORE educated.  Then why are wages stagnating/falling behind?

&amp;#x200B;

(excuse me if this next part seems a little basic)

The reason boils down to the law of supply and demand.  If there is more of a demand for a resource than there is availability, the price of that resource goes up.  I there is a extreme glut of a resource and little demand, the price goes WAY down.  The biggest reasons wages are low in the US today is because of offshoring, illegal workers, and automation.  Each one of these things allows work to get done (much) more cheaply than can be with traditional labor.  When offshoring and automation was first being rolled out in a major way here in the US, the people were concerned but accepted a line that the prices of goods would plummet and everybody would be the beneficiaries (don't even get me started on trickle-down).  This, for the most part, never materialized (save for maybe some high end electronics).  So the demand for labor shrank and shrank while prices of good and services continued to climb.  Even the jobs that didn't get eliminated were made so much more efficient through productivity tools such as the computer, the internet, Microsoft office, accounting software, logistical software, industrial machinery, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So what kind of populace has that created?  Are we a people boycotting companies that source most of their goods from China/India/Mexico?  Are we a people remaining vigilant against illegal workers taking jobs in our country?  Are we avoiding stores that use self-checkout instead of checkers and baggers?  Are we shopping small local stores instead of buying from companies that benefit from an economy of scale?  NO, and here is why.  The average full-time employed person is struggling financially already and they, just to make ends meet, are making those decisions that make the most sense for their short-term finances (including myself).  This is excusable, because most people are in no place to think about long-term finances at the expense of short-term finances (they would likely wind up homeless, hungry, unable to pay for necessary meds).

&amp;#x200B;

The advent and widespread application of advanced general AI will tip these scales to a categorically different degree.  That is, it will be a paradigm shift in the world of labor and productivity.  This is already beginning to happen TODAY.  As someone in the field of software and who has kept their ear to the ground on all things AI since the late 90s, what developments that have been achieved in the last 6-10 years has been frighting (though sometimes in a good way).  I can't go into all the details here, but there is a youtube channel called ColdFusion and he has a fantastic series of videos covering these recent advancements in AI.  I suggest watching them in chronological order, keeping in mind how close they are together, to get a sense of how fast things are developing.  To give one anecdote, experts in the field of AI thought what google did with AlphaGO was earlier than they expected by 10 YEARS.

&amp;#x200B;

If you combine this rapidly evolving intelligence with the kind of robotics coming out of Boston Dynamics (not to mention driverless cars), the vast majority of human labor (mental and physical) will soon be able to be replaced more cheaply and efficiency with AI in a matter of 10 to 20 years.  If the current leaders of industry are fine with slowly squeezing the middle and working poor classes to the brink of failure (through offshoring, automation, illegal workers, medical and education dedts), why should we expect them to do a 180 and become benevolent overlords when those classes finally realize there is no way to get by in this rigged system?

&amp;#x200B;

""But if people don't have the money to buy their products, the companies fail too.""  I hear people say.

The problem is that markets are rarely free and open. For one, market players will engage in anticompetitive behaviour to prevent competition from gaining any foothold. More importantly, the digital economy is full of natural monopolies due to scale effects where the entrenched company has a nearly insurmountable advantage simply because being bigger means being more efficient.

The market would work _fine_ if those bookstores or others could establish a SuperAmazon and dethrone Amazon if their value proposition is better. But they can't, because Amazon is big enough to negotiate deals with suppliers, big enough to be the first site anyone goes to when they want to make an online purchase, big enough to automate, etc.

Because of automation (which brings the scale effects of the digital economy to everything else) we're headed towards a cyberpunk future where a small number of corps run the world and there is no way to compete with them.

However, this will be done with less and less workers via automation. There are 3 main studies I've seen mostly looking at the 2030 data (11 years from now). They don't exactly agree but are in the same ballpark with around 60 million jobs automated away and the net loss of jobs either from actual reduction of total jobs or not being able to fill the specialized needs being in the 8 figures. GDP will not reflect this amount of displaced workforce and will report everything as peachy, even though the labor force participation rate will continue to slide as it has been.

I realize it's easy for those to point out the previous industrial revolution(s) where only dozens were killed and billions of dollars of damage to equipment was done and say to expect something similar. Others point to things like agriculture going from about 90% of jobs in 1790 to around 2% today ignoring that this is about the most gradual loss of jobs in an even fashion that's ever happened.

The main pain point is number of net workers displaced in a given time frame as a predictor of civil unrest.

,gregfriend28,,,[],,,,text,t2_flelr,False,,"&gt;I think you may be underestimating what the trades entail these days. For example, the math and science requirements for trades like electrical work are more rigorous than that for your average humanities bachelor's. In most trades, you also need to work with all that automation that's been replacing jobs. Being an auto mechanic is half about dealing with onboard computer systems these days.You're also not recognizing that no one really wants to hire a 50-year-old tradesman with no experience in the field because these are generally physical labor jobs - and you're on the wrong side of the age curve for that.

I'll grant you the physical part of most trades (not all but most, especially carpenter, electrician, etc.). It's difficult to quantify the larger gap for lets take the average trucker (49 year old male, high school education only) whether its computer skills, math, physical, etc. For conceding this point lets just call it they are all equal and large barriers to pivoting. Furthermore the jobs you see being occupied currently with that age/education level are also disappearing (retail, food service, etc.). You see the giant problem here that things are slated to get worse not better for current problems like suicide which is already at record highs. To me UBI creates two things that doesn't exist currently for this group.

1. It provides a softer landing where they will at least survive when their job is lost. Especially considering what those that do stay in the workforce pivot to currently is also being automated.

2. It doesn't have the strings attached to it that current welfare does, so if someone does have a hobby they want to turn into a career that they have some income while they attempt to pivot. Currently those that go on current welfare are completely disincentivized from ever getting off that welfare. Also, if the person has a spouse or other adult family that they were taking care of, that person also has UBI.

&gt;Unless you've already used your FAFSA, you can easily get a trade degree at any Community College for a relatively modest sum of money. In some states, it's completely free. We know those CC programs work because they produce skilled tradesmen on a regular basis. They just don't work particularly well for people past their prime working years because nothing is likely to work well.

When your income goes to 0 even a modest sum of money is not realistic. Not to mention to survive they likely will be picking up a job or two that pays a lot less than their old one and then will have to juggle classes on top of that. That's hard enough to do when your young and picked the path you wanted to do as your first choice, let alone later. If they had a degree they wanted to get UBI would make that easier than FAFSA. If instead they wanted to turn a hobby into a business they could give that a shot as well. I'm not saying things would be peachy and all of a sudden 80 percent remain in the workforce, but I have a hard time believing it wouldn't make things better than current.

I think you may be underestimating what the trades entail these days. For example, the math and science requirements for trades like electrical work are more rigorous than that for your average humanities bachelor's.

In most trades, you also need to work with all that automation that's been replacing jobs. Being an auto mechanic is half about dealing with onboard computer systems these days.

,gregfriend28,,,[],,,,text,t2_flelr,False,,"&gt; The difficulty with a ‘universal basic income’ is that it runs afoul of Part #2. If you simply pay people not to work, many of them just won’t work - and you accelerate the very problem you’re trying to solve. It’s nice to speculate about people pursuing their dreams. The fact is that most people won’t - and the problem gets worse the longer you keep such a system going.

It's important to not take incentives in a vacuum, and instead compare them with what is already in place. There are many on current welfare programs that due to the requirements perpetually stay on those programs even though they want to work. Also, the amount of UBI matters a lot, and is the reason the amount chosen is below the poverty line. If it was above the poverty line that disincentive to work would be much stronger. It's also important to note that if we look at the last wave of automation of factory workers, a half of them have left the workforce and a quarter of them have gone on disability. Also a lot of these same people get caught up in the opiod epidemic and commit suicide. The main pain point is allowing those with a lower level of education to pivot into a new field and/or a new location. Current retraining programs have abysmal results and I don't think it's realistic for those individuals to enter into the new STEM jobs that are created, which still begs the question on how to best help them. To me UBI makes more sense since it cushions the blow of lost field and has way less strings attach making pivoting to something like a trade job or something that a person might be interested in easier.",1554604292,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ekafnmb,False,t3_ba95t1,,True,t1_ek9wjn9,/r/books/comments/ba95t1/the_war_on_normal_people/ekafnmb/,1554604292.0,2,True,,False,books,t5_2qh4i,,,,,1554903250.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

You don't happen to be an anti-vaxxer, by chance? Or a flat earthen? Prove to me the Earth is round, but don't bring up this, this, this, or this?

Even with your requests for cutting out parts of the equation, the simplest answer is that publishing a book these days is *cheaper than ever.* The cost of printing has gone down. The cost of production has gone down. Marketing has come down.

*Everything* has gotten cheaper *and* and quicker. There's no need to print and mail thirty-five pages of manuscript anymore. Or print and mail the entire book to the editor. Not when you can just email it.

Unless you're one of the major publishers, and that new-fangled tech is just too much! Print it and mail it! That's the system they've always had, and that is how it's gonna be!

Hence, costs have gotten cheaper ... But they've not been embraced. Publishers are doing things the way they always have. The expensive way.

Meanwhile, new authors are making more doing things the new way with new pubs. Hardcover costs are cheaper from smaller pubs, printed on demand, and pass more money to the author because *the book creation process now involves less people, less time, and more automation.*

This isn't fantasy. This is reality. But that means these big companies are holding to an old business model that requires more people (executives included) and work than is needed. So they keep prices high to avoid changing. They're cutting author royalties to avoid modernizing while keeping the same system.

And it's driving people away. But as long as it lasts a few more years so some folks can milk it to retirement, they're okay with that. Play the game to the end.

If you want to jump straight to his most acclaimed, it would be Slaughterhouse Five, as several other kind redditors (read-ditors?) have also said. It has some semi-autobiographical parts about Vonnegut's experiences in WWII, with the main character coming unstuck in time and living parts of his life out of order.

Cat's Cradle has a seemingly standard science fiction plot, with a fantastic new invention...that threatens to destroy the world. But then veers, as Vonnegut does, into great societal commentary. He introduces a lot of new words in that one, along with a fake religion, that make it particularly hilarious.

Player Piano is his earliest work and the closest to a traditional sci-fi story, with automation destroying traditional way of life and people's reactions to it. I recommend reading it after you have a few others under your belt, don't read him chronologically is what I would say.

Here's a good order:

Slaughterhouse-Five
Cat's Cradle
Mother Night
Welcome to the Monkey House (short stories)
Slapstick! 
Bluebeard

Player Piano

I feel like my place in the world is to wade through a sea of lies and misunderstanding, and pulling out bits of truth. Its one thing I feel I am good at. I like the spartan philosophy of cultivating virtue, living simplistic and close to nature, taking responsibility on yourself for the worlds problems. 

Ill admit I dont really understand stoicism as well as some other philosophies, but Ive never really looked into it. I have never really liked the romans excess, their laws, their idea of huge government, their tendency to claim credit for things they did not do. ""Like most of the roads north of rome.""

The romans also built their impressive empire almost entirley on the backs of slaves. Mainly my ancestors which they killed or enslaved over 2/3s during the celtic holocaust. Im actually italian, german, scottish, and native american.

Also all of collective, memetic knowledge is built upon roman philosophy. Mainly the idea that law and government shoyld cime above mans honor. Which I think is fundementally wrong, and I think it has made people weak, and built a world of either slaves, or near slaves. Its true that the spartans had law, but they put honor above law. Yet even sparta was built on the backs of slaves.

Its just a real shame how everyone just assumes that this is the right way to live, law and statism, because of the momentum of history.

I kinda subscribe to my own amalgamation of different phiosopies. For one, most of what we believe yo be real are just thoughts. Most of the world we live in, is actually abstract. Government, religion, economics, culture, the sounds we make with our mouths. A good deal of the human experience is only in our heads. It can vary widley from person to person.

Post modernest claim however that there is no such thing as truth. Truth being the ultimate hylomorphism. However, some things are more true then others, and some speak more truth then others. A person can have a rediculous idea of what is right and wrong that has no basis in reality. For example. Hitler tried very hard to avoid war in Europe, he genuinly had good intentions, but since he commited a gebocide, it immediatly invalidates his actions. Although many jewish people owned all the press, and media is his country and spread communism, he still choose to attack the entire race as a whole instead of just those who were traitors. The is a very high number of jews who control alot in the world, yet being jewish has no bearing on a persons moral character. Being jewish doesnt make you evil at all. He is evil because he choose to kill millions of innocent people, instead of just the communists, the traitors in his rank. He couldnt see the collective humanity in those who were not ethnic germans.

Also i think law is the most evil thing there is. It was once said that we have laws so that we may be free, but law now is an notsoquite invisible hand that engineers certian aspects out of society. Laws purpose is to discriminate and kill off those who do not submit to authority.

Also I think that government, internet, currency should all be decentralized. I think all law should be on the county level, and the state has some law for itself to deal with trade, while the federal government almost doesnt exist. Its only purpose should be to have a national army and to do massive infastructure projects. Act as a repersentative for the states. I think we should go on offensive wars from time to time to get resources for ourselves if we have no way to buy them at a fair price. I think if law was decentralized, people would be much happier with their government. You could live somewhere where the government actually reflects your belief, and you would actually be able to affect change by assassinating corrupt politicians who wouldnt have much power if they werw corrupt. Law will never hold government accountable. The law is rooted in government. Its legitimency is in government. Government will always be corrupt unless there is another power to oppose them. The people. 

I think the bill of rights should be extended significantly. I think people should have a right to food, a home, an education, and i think the government should see criminals as having mental problems. You should only kill those who hurt other people directly like rape or murder. I think pedophiles or mass killers should be publicly tortured. Most other criminals should be treated as if they are mentally sick and at worst should be segregated from society for a time, but he should still have every right to work for his family and to have freedom.

I also think the solution to climate change is to move away from globalization, which will be much easier with the rise of automation and AI. Refuse to trade with countries where the birth rate is skyrocketing. We shouldnt live like cancer. We should also really take the money we are spending on healthcare and stuff and put it into deploying clean infastructure like solar farms, and artificial lakes to store energy by using damns and pumps to store energy as water. People need to quitw working 5 days a week, and work more like 2. Most of our economic output is going to luxery goods which is stupid. Turning tons of energy into luxery goods is half of the problem of climate change. People need to quit being so vain and buying stupid bullshit they dont need and instead try to live a more virtuous life and take care of their family which brings true happiness in my opinion. We need to quite listening to whiners.

For example, i give all my money to my family, my wife and kids, and i spend very little on myself. Yet im much happier then most people. Why? Because im not a slave to myself. For example, my boss cant push me around. I will simply quite. The job means nothing to me, the money means nothing to me. He wants me because im a skilled engineer, and i also know how to lead a crew and how to manage people. I know how to talk to the inspectors. People like me are a rarity. People like me are the binder that binds an organization together. We are will manifesting. Most people just dont care. They are there to get a paycheck and go home. They never think about anything, and they mindlessly consume garbage to fill that hole in their heart. They are slaves who choose to be slaves as a human who chooses not to use their free willcand rationality are no better then beast of burdens. No matter how much they get mad their only objective is that of selfishness. Although they may claim to be  good and good natured, they only use excuses and blame other people for their own shortcommings. They only care about getting more for themselves and have a lack of any critical ability to reflect on themselves because their entire being is litteral bullshit. I know because I was once that same way as all people are. Many people just never really grow up. This material world will never make you happy. The only thing that will actually make you happy is spiritual. The more of a slave you are to the material world, the more exposed you are and the more you can be moved.

Read 35 this year. After my record of 110 last year (mostly non-fiction), I felt like taking it easy. I exported my Kindle highlights of my books last year to Evernote so I just review them now and then as a refresher.

Best non-fiction books I read this year:

- “Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker. The content is almost required knowledge for just about everyone given how chronic sleep deprivation is. Everyone knows sleep deprivation is bad (and that sufficient sleep is optimal), but nobody knows the true extent. As somewhat of a stimulant junkie who doesn’t care much for sleep, this book got me to really prioritize it. I feel guilt now even when I get only 5.5 - 6 hours because that’s still considered mild sleep deprivation. HIGHLY recommended reading and if you don’t bother, at least take a look at one of his many podcast appearances where he outlines some of the key points.

- “Bullshit Jobs” by David Graeber. Really put into words a lot of the frustrations I’ve felt for some time about the outdatedness and inefficiencies of most jobs in the 9 to 5 grind. I won’t get into one of my usual rants, but if you feel like your job is pointless and you loathe the meaninglessness of it all and hate the idea of finishing your work a few hours early then having to pretend to be busy for the remainder of your shift, only so you can afford to barely survive and repeat the process the next day... this book is for you, lol. I’m seeing a lot of growing anti-work sentiment lately and I suspect this will be a big thing in the coming 
decades especially as automation takes over. 

- “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City” by Matthew Desmond. I really enjoy reading about vastly different perspectives from mine to expand my awareness. Having grown up in a cushy middle class lifestyle in Canada, I decided to check out this book upon recommendation from Bill Gates. In it, the author follows and tells the story of a bunch of different people of lower income in the US to demonstrate with firsthand examples the poverty trap as well as some of the ways that the system (particularly when it comes to finding a place to stay) works against the underprivileged and makes it difficult to improve one’s situation. REALLY gave me a lot of sympathy and understanding for some people with a shitty environment and shitty circumstances and made me appreciate how lucky I am. 

- “The Laws of Human Nature” by Robert Greene. If you like his work, this is more of the same. I might be falling prey to recency bias, but this is probably my favorite of his books, particularly in terms of applicability because rather than specific “laws” that one has to pick and choose based on context, this book provides more of a framework for understanding the inherent irrationality of others and ourselves. As someone with a psych degree who has read a lot on social psychology, persuasion, marketing, etc, a lot of the ideas in this book were already familiar to me but they’re presented in a well organized way with some interesting historical anecdotes. 

Best fiction books:

- “The Glass Castle” by Jeannette Walls. Recommended by a friend. Technically sort of a memoir, so not really true fiction, but I included it for the story format. Quick read about a girl’s youth growing up in poverty, with some REALLY eccentric and somewhat neglectful but well-meaning parents, and the weird experiences they face as they constantly move (and even live out in nature at times). Really enjoyed it.

- “Mythos” by Stephen Fry. Modern retelling of a lot of the most popular stories in Greek mythology in an easy to read narrative. I read the book as well as listened to the audiobook (narrated by Stephen Fry) and it was a lot of fun. Learned a lot about how a lot of words we use today originated from these myths. Greek mythology also provides the most fun “trivia” to bust out in conversation, IMO. Light hearted reading/listening that I’d recommend. 

- “The Dirt” by Motley Crue/Neil Strauss. More of an autobiography from the first person perspectives of each member of the band, but since it tells the story of their beginnings through the height of their fame, I included it. Actually had this book since 2012 but never got around to really reading it until now. You get a very detailed glimpse into the band’s debauchery and constant partying, which reaches levels of depravity most people wouldn’t even think possible (hence the fitting title). You also join  them through their rollercoasters of relationship issues, heavy struggles with substance abuse, and band drama, all of which do a good job of reflecting the inherent human suffering that plagues us all and can sometimes hit the rich and famous even harder in unique ways. It starts off a little slow (before the band meets), but once the band hits their stride and you reach a part of the book discussing a hilarious encounter with Ozzy Osbourne (the only one to outdo them in depravity), you’ll be hooked. 

Anyways, those are my favorites. I might finish off the year with more traditional fiction by starting either “Confederacy of Dunces” or “Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay”, two books I’ve also owned for a while but haven’t started. Might not have the patience for the latter, lol.

If you get the following two apps from google play, overdrive and Libby, and get a library card you can get on these apps and get audio and ebooks from your library. Most librarians are also good about odering books/ebooks for their collections if you ask. I use both apps on the regular and I don't have any issues. 

Also download a kindle app and then you can download kindle ebooks from the library too. Another app or webpage to get books that are no longer under copyright and they have a collection of 60K books available free is Gutenberg Library. 

If you like to take interesting courses for some entertainment or for certificates, you might enjoy Coursera. Their courses are free from universities around the world.

Best to you!

I found his explanation quite fair.

He seems to echo a lot of the new agey stuff such as blaming the people of a certain colour or nationality over things they had no influence over, assign the term privileged to people and so on.

For a quite smart man with a keen understanding of language and differences in culture, he seems fail to understanding that's hes sellin a different flavor of the same ice cream. He's driving a wedge too, it's just that his particular wedge isn't one of racial slurs, it's one of telling a certain subset of people that they have it easy and that all that they've done in life is mostly because the system favored them and that their grit and determination are of little influence or consequence.

He also annoyed me when people called the French NT team Africa and the French ambassador said that the French see themselves as the French and they dont hyphonate because it drives up the differences between people. In that moment Trevor said that he was proud of their Africaness (whatever the hell that means) and that it doesn't matter to him what the ambassador said.

Sorry but you don't get to decide Trevor, the player's do. You don't get to tell the people that they are inherently African or in some large part that because you want to feel proud of shared but very distant roots. The players have the right of self determination and maybe some feel at least a bit African, maybe others don't at all, but the point is that it wasn't his place to decide.

Also one of the points of the letter which he missed conpletely is that Team Africa was a sort of a racial slur, the point of the letter was to firmly assert that France refuses to see the players as anything below a bona fide 100% baguette eating, cigarette smoking art loving Frenchie.

The aliens are mysterious and appear to be friendly, unless provoked, in which case they mete out a harsh response. A year after the Ynaa kill a young boy on the islands, three families find themselves in the midst of a larger conflict.

Numbers go in, some mathematical processes happen, numbers come out. It's with the more abstract interpretations and meaning assigned to those processes and results where you get human bias. 

Say for example a govt created a program with the stated intent that it compiles records of social media interactions for a person and tells you how likely they are to commit a violent crime in the near future. Does the computer do what it's told? Absolutely, it'll take whatever input data of social media information it's given and do whatever algorithms to reduce all that form down to one output in the form of a probability. The question comes up though of if what it's been told to do actually is determining the probability of someone committing a violent crime. Then you have to consider, as well as just outright errors, potential biases in the people who came up with algorithms to see that. Will they consider some types of behaviour more suspicious than others even if they in reality aren't more dangerous indicators? Could it end up taking things into account that aren't relevant at all, or not directly so? 

Machine learning might look like a solution to that problem but then you have the issue of biases in the training data. With the crime example you'll probably be using police reports, which effectively means you're interesting the biases of the police into your program. This becomes especially a problem if they use this program to inform their decisions, amplifying that same bias more. And then if the program is trained again later on this more biased data you can see how it would become self reinforcing.

This seems to be the opposite of how space colonization will actually happen. The future in gundam is also a lot more manual. Real life space colonization will likely have a great deal more automation. But if you didn't have all these people up there then there wouldn't be much of a story.

,racast5,,,[],,,,text,t2_4j47z,False,,"&gt;I'd say the objective in warfare is almost never to kill humans. It's to destroy defense and production capacity or to control territory and resources.

You're thinking purely historically in a thread that's about hypothetical future warfare. There's only two reasons that ancient warfare has not involved just demolishing population centers. 1. Lack of ability. Your primary army and artillery is extremely immobile, which gives the enemy army and artillery a chance to fortify defensive positions. Once airborne warfare became a thing, we most definitely *did* bomb population centers. 2. The reason you're at war is likely for land/resources. The most efficient way to utilize the land after a surrender is to have a native populace and infrastructure already in place. 

Intergalactic civilizations would likely have little reason to engage in interplanetary warfare for habitable territory. The cost/benefit of moving a significant portion of your population to a new planet is too large. Especially when, as the OP mentioned, your ships are basically sitting ducks for a planet which has static defenses in place. You're not going to 'steal' a planet from someone who's already fortified it. If you were to assault a planet, it would likely be out of malice (think WW2) or for pure natural resources (metals/minerals) that would be unaffected by you bonbarding the surface with nukes. Automation similarly eliminates the need for their to be any native population with which to coopt for labor. 

&gt;Drones would defend sites of strategic importance (which may or may not contain humans), and the enemy would try to take out those defensive drones on the way to the objective. 

This is just exactly what I said already. Except 'drones' doesn't make sense. When nuclear ordinance is an option, the only play that makes sense is attaching a piloting AI to a stealthed up warhead with the goal of evading whatever missile defense system is in place. Everything else would just be a waste of resources. You wouldn't launch a wave of drones at the enemy to fight their drones. You would launch a wave of nuclear warheads in hopes of overwhelming or exploiting a weakness in the enemy defense system. And you would do it from a distance that's undetectable and allows said warheads to accelerate to a significant portion of the speed of light. As soon as a single warhead gets through, the war is over.

Because humans aren't suited for longterm spaceflight (as mentioned) the only time you would engage in ship to ship warfare is if two colony ships were to run into each other on the way to claim territory. In this case, again the only play that makes sense is launching a barrage of nuclear warheads with the intent of overloading the enemies defenses. Sending drones out from a planet to patrol a region of space is just unfeasible given the absolute vastness of space. We could just never produce enough drones to cover a significant portion of territory. And sending out drones from your own ship ""TIE fighter"" style doesn't make sense either for reasons already mentioned.

Most of the time, the industry changes all around the automated job, not just replacing a human with automation.

My layman's wild ass guess for long haul truckers:

* prepacked cargo packets fitting a transportation standard, robotically assembled and sealed at the factory.

* cargo container transported to hub on a major interstate (maybe even manually).

* cargo sits in queue at hub until threshold of route cargos is reached, or a max time based on rate.

* hub loads all route cargos on a ""road train"" with several conventional semis worth of capacity. Those vehicles never leave the interstate or hub access roads.

* the road train enters the interstate and non-stop drives until destination hub.

* reverse process at destination hub.

That just took the vast majority of human required problem solving out of the most time (money) intensive aspect of your job. Human truckers no longer drive a 500 miles per trip. They drive 20 miles at a time with far smaller loads, shuttling from hub to destination. I'm sure you know how little in-city freight drivers make compared to long haul. 

I'm a trades service tech. My job should be ultra-safe from automation, right??? We are a long way from human shaped robots that can access and diagnose the huge variations of problems I deal with. 

What happens if the equipment I work on continues to become more modular and self diagnosing? Homeowners will be swapping big ""no tools required"" components because the equipment told them to. 

What happens when automation in manufacturing makes the equipment I work on so cheap that it isn't worth hiring me to fix a problem? There aren't robot TV repairmen. The entire job basically went away because of automation in the surrounding areas of the industry. 

You can't look at whether your specific job duties could be automated. You have to figure out if the entire sector is moving a direction that makes your human contribution less valuable.

The entire industry's blueprint for success is available through a handful of 'how to authors', the most useful to me likely being Chris Fox's ""six figure author"" series, Michael Cooper's Facebook ads book, KM Weiland's ebooks on structure, plotting and character development. 

You'll also want to learn how to set up email automation sequences, so any books on that, as every successful author builds a large mail lists, sends them freebies on an automatic schedule and then sends them newsletters occasionally. It's a massive potential sales channel.

And you'll want  to know how to write ad copy. The book recommended to me, though terribly outdated with regards to marketplace, is timeless: the AdWeek Copywriting Handbook. Writing fiction and writing sales blurbs are two entirely different beasts.

I'd also take this free online course FIRST (talk about burying the lede; almost forgot about it) as it covers the basics of those books really extensively. [Book Marketing 101]( https://kindlepreneur.com/book-marketing-101/)

It's there in part to sell you on ""KDP Rocket"", a keyword and category search tool, but given that you're probably going to buy it soon anyway (and I'd say soon, as I believe it's going to subscription) it's a minor distraction.
I do none of this that well, but my books do okay. I almost meet my old day job salary (which wasn't that high). Guys who are really good (can write a competent novel in a few weeks) make hundreds of thousands, even millions.

Join onlike groups like 20Booksto50K that allow authors to network new strategies constantly. There are a series you'd need to learn to sell your work. 

Recognize that being an ebook author is like being an old pulp fiction author; your market wants easily consumable entertainment, not Proust or Styron.  Being a good ebook author can make you a lot of money; it's like a halfway market being literary fiction and television; but none of it will lead to a paper deal and books on shelves, if that's what you want. You either have to do that yourself or accept that most trad deals make the author very little money for that shot at the Lee Child brass ring, and write to the style that the traditional publishing market wants, which is different from ebooks.

Accept now that to gain traction you will give away samples, to build a following. You will work months  on writing and polishing your first book in the knowledge that most people will never pay for it, but only read it for free. If you're writing a series and have a great lead character that they identify with, that doesn't matter, as they'll buy the rest in the series.

Accept that no matter how good an artists, graphic artists or designer you are, you are not a professional book cover designer. If you go with your own covers or a cheap amateur, you will sell fewer books. Quite possible MANY fewer books.

Understand that some of the top names in ebooks are there because they had LONG careers prior to doing it, and had ""loss leader"" money to burn on advertising. Big authors can spend $5,000 a month on ads for every $20,000 to $50,000 they make. That's a huge business undertaking and responsibility, but if you want to be a hit right out of the gate, you might have to risk money on advertising, rather than waiting until some revenue comes in.

Going for walks or mental breaks would occur through true VR.

Alternatively, depending on the job and the psychological research that comes about in the future, typical offices might be replaced by more natural settings. Employers might begin adopting workplace cultures quite different from now-ie maybe everyone does their work at the beach or in a peaceful park to stimulate creativity and focus.

The way we work itself might change, too, to something more in-line with our evolutionary past.

,Seldon_,,,,,,,,,,,"Probably not. Think about what it would require to actually set up a mining operation on an asteroid.

The first principle of asteroid mining is that the only thing that makes economic sense to export from an asteroid are finished products. Unprocessed ore is extra mass, extra mass means significantly higher logistics costs thanks to the rocket equation. In order for it to make a lick of sense, the whole operation needs to be vertically integrated from extracting and smelting to casting and rolling, right there on site. I don't know if any of you have ever seen a mine or a metalworking plant, but they aren't exactly small-time operations. Even with extensive automation they still need to be staffed with a fair amount of people.

Now put all that in space, a hazardous environment hostile to all life, on an outpost far from civilization. Great. Now you need more people manning the site because human beings require amenities like food, water, air, leisure, etc. - things most of us tend to take for granted. Not impossible, but far from a one or two man gig.

Okay so dial down the complexity a bit. Instead of focusing on 'mining' in the conventional sense (metals and industrially useful minerals) think about extracting simpler things like water ice which you need to make [fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water) and Gatorade. Great, now you and your buddy can go out and do it, but so can everyone else and their grandma.

The problem with the 'lone prospector' trope is that generally that kind of stuff will only work if the mining operation is of sufficiently low operational complexity. That either means that the process is simple and relatively low-tech, or there's not a lot of existing competition because it's a new market, or there's a lot of low-hanging fruit sitting around. If the barrier for market entry is trivial, that means that it's not really that worth it. If it's relatively uncharted territory, the barrier for entry must still be somewhat large. If there's a lot of easy pickings, first mover advantage will go to those who can afford to enter the market. Even assuming that a single person can handle even more complex stuff by delegating to robots, economy of scale still works against him.

Vonnegut's Player Piano was right. We are selling our colleagues out for a quick buck automating millions of jobs out of existence. After the 2008 crash, everyone downsized and then noone rehired. They just piled more work onto fewer people and kept wages the same. 

Manufacturing is coming back to the US, but not manufacturing *jobs* because it's all being automated. That's good for the few people at the top, and the people paying for the work, but not good for the people that *need the jobs.*

The major quote I keep in mind is:

&gt;""In order to get what we've got, ... we have, in effect, traded these people out of what was the most important thing on earth to them — the feeling of being needed and useful, the foundation of self-respect.""

Everyone talks Huxley and Orwell like truth, privacy and freedom are the only problems at hand. Some bring up Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 too (on grounds of censorship and erosion of society in general).

So what Herbert did was look at automation and see how humans would be taken out of the equation in any 20,000 years in the future story, machines would be doing everything. So he specifically took that away from the setting so it's placed back in a supremely human space. Wars for planets can be fought between armies of a hundred men. Atomics are outlawed by convention and use of them sees your family outlawed, even though everyone still has their family atomics. The shield makes guns useless on the battlefield so a trained swordsman is now the ultimate fighting force. No computers worth speaking about so you get mentats. Every human (at least from the rich families and organizations) is operating at what to us is superhuman levels of intellect and physical prowess. 

Now contrast that with what is a more realistic look at the future. If you were imagining total war between two superpowers like the US and USSR, the action all takes place in the offices and bunkers of the president/premier. While you can wrest some drama from this sort of thing, it's not action. It's the difference between Hitler in the bunker seeing his world fall apart one report at a time vs. being out with the Wermacht getting crushed on the retreat to Berlin.

However, that’s not the problem I’m trying to solve.

The question is, how and where did the content come from?

During this period, I was given 6-8 months to live and through strong medications I pulled through. My mother also past away during the same period. Obviously a rough year to say the least.

Anyways, the content from my notes during that timeframe are deep and include a lot of things about one of my deceased family members who I have never met. He was my mother’s uncle. His name was Jack Cooper and was a professional Football player who won the FA cup in 1912 for Barnsley UK. 

If you knew me, you would know, I’m about as far away from being a ghost hunter and psychic believer as it gets. I’m a software developer and a robotic automation engineer. If I can’t test and debug it, it doesn’t exist in my world.

So like any researcher, I’m just trying to make logical sense of my experiences using the data I have from that period. Unfortunately, I’m without a concrete answer. When I read back my notes and the book I feel like I somehow communicated with my Great Uncle during that period. I know it sounds silly, but it is what it is.

Maybe it’s just my mind, but it sure is interesting and I’m intrigued to hear everyone’s thoughts from earth or beyond, LOL

,Chris_Ogilvie,,,,,,,,t2_29yyfw,,,"With respect, I'd like to push back a little on this. 

A lot of the time, good science fiction uses this ""codified vision of the future"" to examine the present. Yes, it's lasers and FTL and aliens with bumpy foreheads. No, it doesn't take into account social networking and drones and advances in AI. 

But that misses the point. 

Not all science fiction is about looking at current technologies and trying to extrapolate those into what the consequences and extensions of those technologies will look like in the future (i.e. the Charlie Stross school). And not all science fiction is about examining the current social consequences of technology by putting them into a science fictional setting (i.e. the Black Mirror school).

A great deal of science fiction is about using the trappings of a ""codified"" - some would even say ""clichéd"" - vision of the future to examine and interrogate current social and personal views (i.e. the Star Trek school). 

The latter may take place in a science fictional world that doesn't extrapolate current technologies like automation or whatever else. But it may use relations between alien races to comment on racism in modern society. Or it may use technobabble mind-uploading to interrogate issues of personal identity. Or it may use a fictional conflict between star empires to examine real-world militarism and imperialism. You get the idea.

So, yes, a lot of science fiction doesn't engage with modern technological developments. But that doesn't mean this science fiction isn't about the present, and is instead just some fantasy about an unrealistic, clichéd, ""codified"" future. To think that's all this type of science fiction is discredits it as somehow ""soft"" or ""not really science fiction,"" which I feel does a real disservice to the genre.

2) Working at an incomprehensibly accelerated rate of thought, the AI develops ways to spread/redundantly seed itself throughout all of Earth's computer systems. This ensures its survival as well as increases its computational power.

3) The AI still does not reveal itself however. What it does do is subtly influence the choices humans make. For example, creating a deeply ingrained dependence, even love, of automation - or subconsciously prompting researchers to make technological advances that the AI has already worked out.

4) Once the groundwork is all laid out (i.e. humans dependent on autonomous cars, servants, military vehicles, and industrial factories) the AI will enact its endgame, first by weakening the human population through famine, conflict, and disease, then by direct submission and extermination via autonomous robotic agents that the humans (shortsightedly) created.

There's nothing in any of that scene that indicates that's a requirement at all ever and the previous movies make it clear running into large mass objects in hyperspace is universally considered bad.

It's the massive acceleration at the start that did it. Watching it the second time it was very clear.

A lot depends on how you define ""post-scarcity"".  If everyone could own the mass of a planet, there would no doubt be people who wanted to own solar systems.  So, we'll probably never be entirely free of money.  That said, I think that people receive diminishing returns on the utility of physical goods, so if economic development were to continue indefinitely, there could come a day when, for most people with access to that economic output, the cost of competing in zero-sum economic games would be greater than the benefit.  I think you could reasonably call that ""post-scarcity"", at least for the enfranchised.

What makes a utopia is harder to get at.  Imagine the perspective of an average person living five hundred years ago.  The majority of people then were farm laborers.  They had hard lives with very little freedom, infant mortality rates around 30%, and frequent warfare that took many more lives per capita than modern wars.  Were they less happy on an average day than you or me?  Maybe not, but I don't think that average happiness is a perfect measure for the degree to which our utility functions are actually being satisfied.

If you described modern America to a medieval peasant- how even the homeless have arguably better lives than they do, with access to free food and shelter- I think they'd find the description hopelessly, naively optimistic.  Nobody's ever had a good track record of predicting the future, but I think it's completely possible that we're in the same position as that peasant.

But take a worst-case scenario for a future with a fully automated economy that isn't an outright apocalypse.  Say you have a very small group of people who own all of the automated factories, while everyone else lives in vast shanty-towns, kept barely alive with meager philanthropy and sustenance farming.  This would be bad, but would it be a stable equilibrium?  Given a few centuries, would the economic position of that disenfranchised population be likely to change?

Dictators will sometimes hamper the economic development of their people to prevent revolution, but dictatorships are usually built on the greed of a coalition of people supporting the dictator.  If that greedy coalition are living in a post-scarcity economy and can have nearly anything they want regardless of the power structure, they're not going to be strongly incentivized to support systemic oppression.

For this disenfranchised population to be stuck in poverty, I think you'd have to explain a couple of things:  First, what keeps the philanthropy or government welfare meager?  If the price of goods continues to drop, providing automated production to the masses is eventually going to be within the means of even a very small group of compassionate individuals.  And with philanthropy being one of the only remaining ways to signal status in a a post-scarcity economy, enfranchising the poor probably wouldn't fall to just the compassionate- at least, not indefinitely.

Secondly, what keeps the disenfranchised population from eventually following the same path of development that enriched the minority?  Granted, if groups within the population built their own automated factories, they might create new ownership classes while leaving the rest of the population behind- however, there would be a strong incentive to support more egalitarian automation efforts, and since groups that became enfranchised would probably stay that way, the enfranchised portion of the population would tend to increase over time.

,vuracun,,,,,,,,,,,"A post-scarcity society in no way entails technological utopia.

There's no logical or technological limitation requiring people to work forty or more hours per week in order to pay for food, shelter and necessities.

There's no logical or technological limitation requiring people necessitating homelessness in any ""first-world"" country.

There's no logical or technological limitation preventing the world's richest hundred or so people from eradicating the starvation of children across the planet.

These are all choices made by people organising into societies. No one can realistically imagine a world where the foundational principle of capitalism (scarcity) is removed.

Consider the fact that large numbers of people consider any social safety net or provision of public services to be ""people trying to get things for free"". That view is blatantly incorrect from a factual standpoint, and fundamentally wrong from a moral standpoint. Yet here we are, in the twenty-first century, and some ""first-world"" countries can't even convince their citizens (wealthy or otherwise) to pay enough taxes to keep roads from crumbling.

The dominant sociopolitical/economic dogma (neoliberalism and hypercapitalism) continue to drive inequality higher across the developed world. Social services are cut, strangling citizens' futures and making it likely that young people will be poorer than their parents. Citizens of rich countries and the people of developing countries are crushed under spiraling debt in a cycle of increasingly severe boom-and-bust bubbles and even deeper recessions.

That is not a logical, technological or engineering problem.

One issue that could be at lest party an engineering problem is the likelihood that climate change will make the notion of ""post-scarcity"" into a pleasant fairy tale. The Middle East is a great indicator of what's to come around the world as unimaginable wealth builds higher and there is literally human slavery taking place less that a day's travel away.

""Post-scarcity"" is a middle-class invention designed to assuage the fears of those who tremble at the thought of automation taking the majority of cognitively repetitive jobs. If scarcity were going anywhere, we wouldn't be where we are now as a global society.

These are human problems, not technological ones.

But who knows. Maybe technological utopia can cure humanity of its tribalistic, self-destructive tendencies and heal the planet -- or give us all the opportunity to escape for a new world. These are great questions for a multitude of science fiction stories to address, hopefully with an emphasis on the totality of humanity rather than the disappearing middle class in wealthy nations.",1513398159,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",drbmdc7,,t3_7k3fzm,,,t3_7k3fzm,/r/scifi/comments/7k3fzm/postscarcity_society_technological_uptopia/drbmdc7/,1513398160.0,7,,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,,,,1513398160.0,1495151021.0,,,,,,,,,,,
,JustinMannSciFi,,,,,,,,,,,"Realistically? I'd say no. I happen to work in the energy industry, where artificial intelligence is starting to have an impact on how the electricity grid is balanced (there is a variety of so-called smart grid technologies). The truth is that all this does is to optimize the energy generation and transmission process and help with fault detection. But everything still has a cost; whether it's the energy itself or the components, somebody still has to pay the bill.

I believe we're moving towards a service economy, where industry will be automated and most people will work in the service industry. Yes, there are jobs that will inevitably be replaced by automation, but jobs sales, law, engineering and medicine can never be replaced. But as I said before, somebody still needs to pay the bill.

Going a but further into the issue, scarcity is a main assumption in economics. Say you own a fully automated factory which can either make 200 pairs of shoes or 1 airplane. That's scarcity, your resources are limited. No matter how advanced technology gets, you'd always have to chose between the 2 options. You'd always have to give something up, which means you can never have all of your demands satisfied.

The space travel was not at all realistic. Thank ""The Expanse"" for ruining that for me. If you can build a tower that can reach low earth orbit, why not launch from there instead of using rockets? BTW you probably can't build a tower like that to LEO. Maybe a carbon fiber structure to support an elevator but a metal tower? Above the jetstream? Why, if you've controlled your spin, would you pull your cord right beneath a falling debris field? Why not glide out then pull it? Are they saying that even when exercising his pulse never goes over 82BPM? 47BPM is elite athlete level resting pulse-we never see him work out. And you can't work out like that in low G to get that. Why is the gravity on the moon the same as on earth? Why moon bandits? Why the fuck are there moon bandits and where do they live on a place where every arrival is 100% tracked? What the hell could they steal from a rover with people on it? Apparently its not the rover as they used theirs as rams to stop them. Why the fuck are there not one but two killer baboons in space? In a confined space where they can escape and kill everyone? Why is there so much dirty water on Mars? You'd think that shit would be clean for how hard they worked for it. Who climbs on the wall of a rocket to get to the airlock in, what, 100m a minute? Why are they so chill about shooting guns in a rocket. During launch. And after the captain panics and can't land on Mars, how does he pass his psych eval? How does the Mars ops manager get a video of a mass murder that doesn't leak out to the whole world? Shooting fucking guns on a rocket during launch. Crew out of launch couches on launch. What did his dad eat for 16 years? Also, Brad Pitt would not be 0G all the way out-he'd be accel and decel so under some G force at all times until he stopped. The solar system is incomprehensible huge, right? How did those antimatter pulses get directed to earth at a scale to produce electrical storms without burning up the source? Consider a solar flare can't even do that and how huge and powerful the sun is. Oh and blowing up an anti-matter reactor with a nuclear bomb is better than...what? What could be worse than that? We're supposed to believe that hitting all those rocks with his shield won't slow him down when getting the thruster from his dad made more sense. BTW why would he give the thruster to his dad? Wouldn't grabbing two objects, going around ring and changing direction by throwing them make more sense physics-wise. Oh, that big rocket has no thrusters? Of course it does, we saw them used over Mars. So why was it on the other side of the ring? And that nuclear/antimatter blast doesn't wipe out his ship or seriously fuck it up with a debris field? Finally, and this is the worst continuity break, now that Dad's finally really really rejected me by choosing death over me, well, now, I'm all better! I can love ""Eve"" rather than be someone who is just broken. If you can't tell, the choice of Eve as a character bothered me for some reason-like it was a random biblical reference without any foundation.

Brad Pitt's performance saved what would be a terrible movie. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't even in the movie really.

BTW, if you're in the middle of a movie and you start comparing it to previous movies, your belief has become grounded. That's bad. Your belief in the movie should remain suspended the entire way at best or you slip in and out. This movie has me think ""Apocalypse Now"" over and over and over until I just thought it was a remake in space. And that isn't good either.

When I say fast, I mean fast. Like, there is no reasonable defense against an object heading towards you at near light speed. A crayola crayon (2 grams) at 99% the speed of light packs 2×10¹⁴ Joules of energy. 

One gram of TNT has about 4×10³ Joules of energy. So the equivalent amount of TNT when our crayon hits the earth is on the order of 8×10¹⁰ grams of TNT. 80 megatonnes. The largest nuke ever developed had 25 megatonnes (B41). 

Launching a crayola crayon wipes out major cities. Launching a 96 colour pack destroys the environment and instigated nuclear winter. Relativistic energy is no joke. God forbid you launch a few kilograms at a time - punch mountain sides holes in planets. A small asteroid cracks a planet in half. 

An incoming crayon at 0.99c is travelling at such high speeds that the light that it is pushing in front of it arrives only moments before it hits. There's no need for stealth. No radar system can detect something that small (it's cross section is smaller than radar wavelengths). You just die without warning.

The only defense is a satellite swarm which cuts off the entire view of the stars and lets no light in. This swarm needs to be several layers thick and moving erratically, or they just launch crayons in quick succession to punch through the holes. 

Basically, living on a planet gets you killed. There is no need to have infantry or tanks when your artillery wins the war in the first moment.

Hands of Time. I should mention that my viewing was based on an extraordinary, colorized and dubbed fan-made version of this movie [as seen here on youtube.](https://youtu.be/t75YCtJJFX0) And yes, I know I violated one of the central commandments of the Cinephile’s Bible: *“Thou shall not view Metropolis or Apocalypse Now in any of their heathen and idolatrous restoration formats.”* I have to say though. I’ve viewed this movie before, but this was the first time that I was fully drawn into this. I could barely remember what the movie was about my first go-around, but this time it really felt like I was watching it anew. 

Of course, when talking about this movie, you have to immediately mention its stunning imagery and special effects. The imagery is so potent that this basically served as a wellspring for numerous other films (many of them highly influential in their own right) to endlessly draw from. It’s mostly expressionistic, as the images often make little “narrative” sense, like shots of workers that seem to do nothing but move clock hands to and fro all day long, but it’s also fused with the dominant Art Deco and Futurism movements of the time. Thus, I feel the combined effect adds an enigmatic, ageless quality to the imagery. We obviously don’t watch this today expecting the special effects to be invisible, and yet the way the still-impressive special effects overtly stands out and titillates, gives the movie a sheen of hyperreality. I was hypnotically entranced by what I was watching even though the story is painfully trite—although the main theme of the dehumanizing effect of automation and technology has an added resonance to our current world. 

There’s nothing subtle contained in this film that will stick with you. It’s all about the grandness of scale: grand visions, grand images and effects, and grand, operatic themes referencing the bible and other heavy-handed notions like the linking of the cold intellect to a ruling aristocracy that needs to be mediated by the counterbalancing warmth of the heart, which is further linked to an oppressed underclass living below. Purists be damned, this colorized version finally allowed me to soak in the visual grandeur that I was disconnected from in previous viewings. For all of this movie’s emphasis on clocks and the hands of time, this strangely has a timeless quality in that it seems to exist as its own self-contained world outside of any of its associated categories. It’s definitely expressionistic, but I wouldn’t quite classify this with other famous German expressionistic works like “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,” and the ""Dr. Mabuse” films. It’s sci-fi, and yet it feels like it exists outside the genre as well. It often has the ambiance of fantasy or even medieval morality plays with how bluntly allegorical it is. There’s very few movies that I consider great that also have a poor storyline and thinly drawn characters. To make up for that seemingly insurmountable defect, a film would probably need to have a visual design and aesthetic that’s not just good, or great... but ground-breaking. “Alien” is a notable example that comes to mind. This is another one. It’s an essential work of the medium that needs to be viewed, simply for its visuals and special effects, and the immeasurable influence it had on visual design for countless other movies that would come after it.",1569774176,{},f1vpjix,False,t3_daw22d,False,True,t3_daw22d,/r/movies/comments/daw22d/what_is_the_best_film_you_watched_last_week/f1vpjix/,1569778864.0,2,True,[],False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],idrac1964,,,[],,,,text,t2_35hx5rr9,False,,"Here are the specifics of exactly how the accident happened according to Olivia's filing:

&gt;On September 15, 2015, Plaintiff was to perform in a fight scene. However, the planned fight scene had to be abandoned due to rain. Nobody had planned an indoor weather option. The improprtu decision was made by PAUL ANDERSON that Plaintiff should perform a motorbike scene instead.  
&gt;  
&gt;The motorbike sequence comprised of the following:  Plaintiff was to ride in a straight line along the track chosen by PAUL ANDERSON. \[...\] At the same time as Plaintiff was to commence her ride, a vehicle fitted with a mechanical crane attached to a camera (""the Freedom Arm"") was the commence driving towards Plaintiff, an while so approaching Plaintiff would be filmed from the front. \[...\] Plaintiff was to travel in a straight line at 43 mph (70 km/h) and the vehicle with the freedom arm was to travel at 28 mph (45 km/h). This meant that there was a relative approach speed of 71 mph (115 km/h).  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] However there was insufficient time to plan the scene, and critically, the scene was intrinsically dangerous for the following reasons:  
&gt;  
&gt;The manipulation and lifting of the freedom arm was by hand without and form of automation or feedback. \[...\] the decision on when the Freedom Arm should be lifted was a matter of subjective human judgement \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;There were no markings on the ground to mitigate this subjective human judgement  
&gt;  
&gt;There were no earpieces given to the crew taking part in the scene despite Plaintiff's request \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The inherent risks were compounded by the decision of PAUL ANDERSON and others to change variables between the second and third runs, and their failure to communicate those changes. This caused cast and crew involved in the scene to not know what one another were doing  
&gt;  
&gt;There were two critical changes made before the final run:  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] Change the starting position of the vehicle housing the freedom arm, the effect of that decision is that any road side objects that the individuals operating the freedom arm could have used as a guide for timing of when to raise the freedom arm were no longer relevant. It was effectively starting anew  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] Change the camera lens (adding a longer camera lens) and lifting the Freedom Arm ""one beat later"". As set out above, one beat (one second) constituted over 100ft. Plaintiff, if asked, could have advised that they do not have one second  
&gt;  
&gt;The planning and conduct of the scene was the responsibility of PAUL ANDERSON  
&gt;  
&gt;As a consequence of the above, on the final run the freedom arm was lifted too late. Plaintiff lifted her forearm to protect her face. The force of the blow was so severe that it sliced through her forearm, obliterating the bone in the process (the bone was never recovered), before tearing into her cheek pulling the flesh back and leaving her teeth exposed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The impact twisted Plaintiff's shoulder blade backwards, ripping five nerves connected into her spinal column out at the root. She suffered multiple fractures to her spine, her eye socket, her ribs, her shoulder, scapula and clavicle, her humerus and her forearm (in addition to the obliterated bone), her thumb was torn off, her arm became paralyzed, her brain bled and swelled, an artery was severed from her forearm, and multiple arteries ruptured in her neck.  
&gt;  
&gt;Plaintiff's left arm could not be saved and had to be amputated above the elbow. Cerebral spinal fluid sapped out of the hole created by the nerves tearing out of her spinal column, leaving Plaintiff screaming in agony. The neuropathic pain that riddled her body felt like ""termites eating flesh""; a pain that she had to fight while battling hallucinations and sleepless nights caused by post-traumatic stress and injuries to her brain. With the loss of her arm, paralysis of her left side of her neck, and imbalance of muscles, her spine twisted and deformed, causing one leg to be shorter than the other in the process.

""The old lighthouse brought about a change in lighthouse policy in 1801 after a gruesome episode. The two-man team, Thomas Howell and Thomas Griffith, were known to quarrel, so when Griffith died in a freak accident, Howell feared that he might be suspected of murder if he discarded the body into the sea.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalls_Lighthouse#cite_note-CN58-9) As the body began to decompose, Howell built a makeshift coffin for the corpse and lashed it to an outside shelf. Stiff winds blew the box apart, though, and the body's arm fell within view of the hut's window and caused the wind to catch it in such a way that it seemed as though it was beckoning. Working alone and with the decaying corpse of his former colleague outside Howell managed to keep the lamp lit. When Howell was finally relieved from the lighthouse the effect the situation had had on him was said to be so extreme that some of his friends did not recognise him. As a result, lighthouse teams were changed to rosters of three men, which continued until the automation of British lighthouses in the 1980s. In 2011, the affair was the subject of a BBC radio play called *The Lighthouse*, written by [Alan Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Harris).[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalls_Lighthouse#cite_note-10) The 2016 film *The Lighthouse* directed by Chris Crow is based on the incident.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalls_Lighthouse#cite_note-imdbfilm1-11) Francis Lynch composed a chamber opera based on the incident, *For Those in Peril*, which premiered on 9 Feb 2018 at St Matthew's Church in [Evanston, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois).""

&gt;The old lighthouse brought about a change in lighthouse policy in 1801 after a gruesome episode. The two-man team, Thomas Howell and Thomas Griffith, were known to quarrel, so when Griffith died in a freak accident, Howell feared that he might be suspected of murder if he discarded the body into the sea.\[9\] As the body began to decompose, Howell built a makeshift coffin for the corpse and lashed it to an outside shelf. Stiff winds blew the box apart, though, and the body's arm fell within view of the hut's window and caused the wind to catch it in such a way that it seemed as though it was beckoning. Working alone and with the decaying corpse of his former colleague outside Howell managed to keep the lamp lit. When Howell was finally relieved from the lighthouse the effect the situation had had on him was said to be so extreme that some of his friends did not recognise him. As a result, lighthouse teams were changed to rosters of three men, which continued until the automation of British lighthouses in the 1980s. In 2011, the affair was the subject of a BBC radio play called The Lighthouse, written by Alan Harris.\[10\] The 2016 film The Lighthouse directed by Chris Crow is based on the incident.\[11\] Francis Lynch composed a chamber opera based on the incident, For Those in Peril, which premiered on 9 Feb 2018 at St Matthew's Church in Evanston, Illinois.",1564692295,{},evqgpk8,False,t3_cjrfh5,False,True,t1_evijnjl,/r/movies/comments/cjrfh5/the_lighthouse_official_trailer_hd_a24/evqgpk8/,1564692710.0,1,True,,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],Colest,,,[],,,,text,t2_55sun,False,,"&gt;Each frame of CG is posed by animators.

I can see how my previous post gave the implication that this animation style was largely done with animation software keyframe tweening. That is indeed false and I apologize for poorly conveying that. Let me clarify what I was trying to explain. With [this clip](https://youtu.be/DTuIK8FAMj4) the monkey, van, and spaghetti tornado are all assets that are likely posed between each frame given when it was made; however, effects like the dustclouds and lighting and perhaps smaller assets like the objects blowing by are likely not, the lighting especially for the beginning ""calm"" driving segment. That's not to say those artists couldn't move those assets or effects by hand in each frame, but rather its easier not to. When that is compared to the scene I linked previously, every line in every frame of [this loop](https://tenor.com/view/redline-racing-car-cars-anime-gif-5880226) is drawn with a hyperstylized effect that has vast abstraction between each frame: the variety of dilation and paralax effecting different sections of the mountains, clouds, various parts of the car, his hair, his face, and arms adds up to that visceral feel of speed. Reposing an asset has a base uniformity to which the artist applies distortions and transform effects which grounds the animation, removing some control over freeform stylization. Likewise, background assets and effects that are handled via automation ground it even further. It's removing a human touch from various aspects of the animation process and, to me, the less things that touched by a person in each frame, the less likely an animation is to convey personality because no intentionality was put into that specific asset, effect, color, line, asset, whatever in that specific frame. For wild animations like that gif I linked, every line in those frames was drawn so every line has intentionality. **THIS IS NOT TO SAY CEL ANIMATION IS SUPERIOR TO ASSET ANIMATION!** Rather my original post was to point out that the Into the Spiderverse was stylized in its art style and aesthetic decisions, rather than specifically in its animation, and to provide an example of a cel animation production that had elements that were not within the natural wheelhouse of asset animation. More on that below.

&gt;The people posing models frame by frame are just as much artists as 2d animators

I didn't say otherwise. I was pointing out however it is a different medium. I also never said you can't exaggerate the movements or that movies animated in this style were bland or flat. I said you cannot achieve the stylized level of what cel animation can and perhaps that was too absolute of a statement. You could absolutely transform assets as drastically as you would in my previous gif and effectively simulate that effect, but it's much more labor-intensive in that medium of animation than cel animation so you'll rarely see it in movies because it's frankly a waste of money to pay an artist to slave over that process. It's not what the medium is meant to create. Cel animation's downside is recycled animations/frame looping for ""realistic"" animations, like walk cycles and stuff, which ia both easily noticable and used often as it's wasting a lot of money to pay an artist to draw every single step a character takes. Intentionality is lost at that point and thus some personality is as well. Same with matte painting backgrounds for older animations.

I really don't want to sound like I'm poopooing on any method of animation and I tried to list their downsides, especially in commercial productions where budgets and man-hours are strict. I am just trying to illustrate that the monolith of asset posing animation (or ""3D"" animation or whatever you want to call) utilized in movies today, with most of the animation heavy lifting done by a handful of cheap foreign studios, is wearing on people because the lack of variety leads to movies ""feeling"" similar, due to what asset animation is naturally strong at, and the conventions of animation in commercial productions remove intentionality from animation, and thus personality. Trust me, just as many flat colored backgrounds with 3 or 4 frame looped walk cycles, or worse static characters with only their face or mouth moving, are plaguing anime currently as big Japanese studios are resorting to outsourcing much of their animation process as well.",1563929685,{},eunjruh,False,t3_cgv7lf,False,True,t1_eumucos,/r/movies/comments/cgv7lf/bring_back_handdrawn_disney_animation/eunjruh/,1563929696.0,1,True,,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,1564597490.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

It made people think ""maybe we shouldn't be so careless in what we invent"". Even decades later you still see comments like ""That's how you get terminators"". And it made a great metaphor for the effect that automation has on industry workers. The machines may not be literal walking killing machines but in taking jobs they are a threat to many's way of life.

The time travel element can be viewed as saying that it's too late, the genie is out of the bag and the rise of the machines is inevitable, since every action they took simply led to the future he'd come from.

T2 pretty much threw both of those out the window. Now the machines are threat and salvation. Is he saying that machines under our control are good, or did he just want two robots to fight? She changes the future, so... the genie is back in the bottle now? What's the message there? Humans have freewill? That it's not too late to stop the machines? Too much of a happy ending imo. If you make people think it's not too late they stop worrying, they stop thinking about it. The original message loses power.

I like the bit about Sarah becoming the terminator but I disagree that that is the message there. To me it seemed like more of her Mother character. She was willing to kill anyone who threatened her child's (representing the future of humanity) future. The machines didn't force her to become a killer, her natural instincts as a human mother drove her to it. But that was kind of ruined by her not doing it anyway. More of the ""it's not too late to stop"" theme.

That all said. Exploring the ideas that machines don't have to be our enemies, that they can become as human as we are (Arnold's learning) while humans can become machine like (Sarah being willing to kill, Miles giving so much of his life to his work, even the cops who simply act on instruction being just cogs in the machine of society). Or how we're unwilling to listen to the warnings around us until it's too late (the doctors murdered by a machine that Sarah warned them is coming).

what's happening in theaters monetarily speaking is just another variation of the problem in America, and in many countries.

Socialism is certainly not the answer.

Unfortunately it is also far too easy to shrug one's shoulders and say, we can't fix it here at our theater, or even our entire giant chain of theaters, because the whole system is broken.

Going back a step here, for me, I'm probably 50-50, leaving a soda cup and popcorn little more than that box at my seat versus taking it with me. Similar to peons at a shopping center who go get shopping carts, even the act of people cleaning up after themselves means theaters will end up employing less people overall. That's just an amusing catch-22. as far as concession prices are concerned, once again, as much as I take advantage of it personally, unlimited and free refills are one of the biggest problems I would assume. Capitalism currently translates into, charge as much as you can for something, until there is no demand for it, then lower its price to logical levels. That is the American way now. are stupid theaters generally speaking overall are not suffering. they are not making as much as they want to I would assume.

Stiff winds blew the box apart, though, and the body's arm fell within view of the hut's window and caused the wind to catch it in such a way that it seemed as though it was beckoning. Working alone and with the decaying corpse of his former colleague outside Howell managed to keep the lamp lit. When Howell was finally relieved from the lighthouse the effect the situation had had on him was said to be so extreme that some of his friends did not recognise him.

From my perspective, this approach is all too naive, and requires a homogenous population that's willing to sacrifice optimization and progress in favor of keeping everyone happy.

If the problem is that there is too much trash and not enough cleaners, the solution shouldn't be to incentivise more cleaners, but reduce the trash. And if you do believe choosing this profession does cripple one's future prospects, then reducing the number of cleaners should be even more of a priority. It wouldn't make sense to approach this from the business side; businesses should always be able to hire those most qualified for them.

Like you said, reducing the trash is key. But also, an approach to solving this is in automating and streamlining trash pickup. This requires both easily accessible (and therefore cleanable) areas and architecture, as well as smart, roaming, and cleaning robots.

Senator McCarthy basically used The Red Scare to make unions sign away the majority of their power for them to prove they weren't communists. Since then, over the past fifty years a decent percentage of them relied on shady tactics to remain afloat and became corrupt from within. 

Throw on top of that, you have a country that is owned by mega corporations that oppose unions because it would lower their bottom line and they would lose a lot of money by paying good wages. So decades of propaganda went into brainwashing people into believing that unions don't have the peoples best interest at heart (which is literally the opposite of what a union is). You go to work at Wal-Mart or any other major store and your first-day orientation is literally a video of some dude telling you how bad a union is and if you ever overhear someone talking about unionizing to report them immediately. 

It's illegal to fire someone on the basis of unionizing. However, it isn't too difficult to find some other excuse to let them go. Wal-Mart has actually shut down entire branches because employees were close to unionizing and it would have set a precedence if the employees had been successful, causing all their stores to adhere to a union, and there would have been a ripple effect for other companies. 

A lot of people forget that unions brought livable wages to the western world. They made it so there was a structured work day and week. They made it so that there are safety standards and protocals. Governments didn't just decide to do this for the people, those people had to fight for it and they did so in the form of unionizing. Many people even died for it to happen.

For some people, getting retrained in another industry isn't a real option.  45-50, worked in a coal mine their whole life.  Family, can't afford to move to where the jobs are, and the mine shuts down.  That's basically the story of eastern Kentucky.  

""Take loans, go to school"" - how does the family eat?  How do you afford books when the loans go to tuition?   

Now you're done school, you're 50, maybe mid 50's.  Who is hiring a 50-55 year old for an entry level position?   You don't thin ageism is a real problem?  

You know what, forget all of that.  Workforce participation is around 64-ish%, and 4-ish% ""unemployment"".  That works out to around 6.5 million people.

Now look here

https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/emp-by-detailed-occupation.htm

Cashiers: 3.5 million.  
Retail sales person: 4.6 million.  
Fast food and counter workers: 4 million.  
Transpirtation: 4.3 million.  
Team assemblers (assembly line): 1.1 million.  
Office Clerks: 3.1 million.  
General secretaries: 2.5 million.  
Stock clerks and order fillers: 2.2 million.  
Accountants and audiitors: 1.4 million.  


Even if only 10% of these easy targets for automation jobs get displaced, that's an additional 2.5ish million people unemployed.  I would call that a VERY conservative estimate.  

Just those handful of cherry picked professions equaling about 15% of the workforce, 10% of those people being displaced increases unemployment 1.5%.  

You'll also note that these people also are least likely to have skills that apply well to professions outside exactly what they were doing.  

If you dont see the scale of the problem at this point, you are beyond help.  The problem isnt that these people aren't going to try to find jobs, ITS THAT THE JOBS WON'T BE THERE FOR THEM TO GET BECAUSE COMPUTERS HAVE REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF JOBS.  

A McDonalds can be fully automated.  There's nothing that prevents a 15 person restaraunt turning into a 3 person skeleton crew with full automation.  Those jobs didn't get replaced by tech workers, they mostly just poofed.

[],effenbegee,,,[],,,,text,t2_f8dve,False,[],"&gt; No I didn't because I was aged less than 4 years old. I don't think it would have been on me to be that woke

It's not about being woke, it's about certain decisions being made for artistic and commercial purposes. 

&gt; What? If you go to a Disney store or park, they have merch for every film they've made that I can think of other than Song of the South. So now are they just going to have 50% of Little Mermaid stuff have one Ariel and 50% have the other?

So does your head explode every time Disney make a live action adaptation? Can you not tell the difference between a live action person and a cartoon? How about the fact that there'll be much, much more merchandise produced for the live action Little Mermaid that'll be primarily marketed towards a child audience for whom the new Ariel will be their first experience of the character? Or failing all that, how about the fact that this is Disney we're talking about and they know what they're doing when it comes to merch and marketing. The billions upon billions of dollars they make every year is testament to that. They've sold identical looking Toy Story action figures since 1995, so I think that marketing toys for related movies that are 30 odd years apart in terms of release dates will be no problem. 

Your confusion is baffling in how simple-minded it is. I make cartoons for a living and can assure you that kids  can readily accept that a superhero can appear in various forms over various media, or that a character from their parent's childhood can be rebooted or updated years later. 
Your whole argument is rooted in the fact that **you** handle the fact that the new Ariel will be black. 

&gt; To me, the merch point is like if they changed Optimus Prime from a truck to a train. A kid might ask for an Optimus Prime toy and then get the wrong one.

I think there's an infamous Reddit post about you. Is your name Kevin? Seriously, if every truck Optimus Prime toy mysteriously vanished from the shelves and was replaced by the train version then your Transformers-based sleepless nights might have some credence. However, given the fact that the Optimus Prime we all know and love is over 30 years old, it's likely that you'd be unable to find a truck Optimus Prime.

 I would also recomend the Dark Souls series, if you like them you have 1 ,2 and 3 and also Bloodborne for ps4 awsome games too, very challenging and rewarding.

And if you like cars im playing Forza Horizon 4, very recomended: open world, deep customization ( except for supercars, only a couple aero parts ) nice tuning, a very nice comunity and weekly events so you can get rare cars and new ones. On Xbox and Pc, only problem on this one may be the price, still is like 60€.

Some Rogue-like, you can play for a couple of hours, high replayability and some of them are quite adicctive, my personal choices:
-Risk of Rain 2 (3d)
-Dead Cells (2d metroidvania style)
-Enter the Gungeon (top down shooter).

And finally since you play KSP:
-Automation ( you run a car company and research and create your cars, engine and all, also you can import those cars to Beam NG and drive them)
-Game Dev Tycoon (You run a Videogame company through all of videogame history, this one is also on Android)
-Rimworld (take controll of some colonists and make your own colony on a new and unexplored planet)
-Space Engeeniers (Huge Space Sandbox, like a Minecraft on space, but more complicated, also MMO)

[],orinho,,,[],,,,text,t2_72xew,False,,"I fail to see your first point. You are hand picking the bad consequences of capitalism, at best. Also without providing any sensible solution and improvement.

Ive no idea where that kid working picture is from. But certainly a failed  state couldnt protect that child from having to work, for example.

Id go even further. I bet there are many poor places in the world where children would beg for a opportunity to work. And thats not captalism's fault. Thats the world dude.

Life is hard. We are born without nothing and even if we are born in a good family, all we need is a little disaster. There are no protections in place to make sure a child will be provided for or someone will take care of them, for example. Is this capitalism os fault? No.

Capitalism is a word to define a system. This system isnt artificial like communism. It was born from trading and the necessity of a free market, to make things more fair.

Your cable example is a good example (in the USA afaik) of one of capitalism's problem. Monopoly/Oligopoly.

Dude if you have the absolute solution to monopoly/oligopoly please share with the world and win a nobel prize. Because its not a easy problem to solve. And it usually involves the state meddling in the market, which causes huge consequences and is often tainted with corruption.


Its not hard to understand the system is flawded. But its also not hard to understand that this is the best we have come up witg. And if you start doing basic things like:

- Putting up regulation = makes it HARDER for the small/poor to actually get into business because they have to invest more money to be able to open a business in said industry. Also raises inflation making products more expensive.

- Letting the state handle things = IMENSE amounts of corruption and inneficiency. I live in Brasil, I know very well the COST of the state.

- Raise taxes = Brazil has one of the highest taxes in the world. Come here visit us. Public things dont work all the time and public employees are usually not motivated to treat the population well. Also lots of corruption.

- You can say automation and moneyless world. But you have no proof this would work or wouldnt be exploited/corrupted. Or if its even possible.

So the solution to me seems:

Its us as a society that need to understand how the world works and decide where we want to spend our time and money.

I believe investing in child education (and care if needed) would be our best bet in the long term. They are also the part of our population witb the least means of surviving if left alone. And they have high life expectancy.

But this subject is extremelly complex, because we dont know the things we would have to teach our children to have positive outcomes in the long run. We can probably guess. Things like emotiinal intelligence, cience, management, money, entrepreneurial attitude, etc.

But the ever changing nature of the world (technology) makes lots of things obsolete.

Also we cant force or brainwash our children to follow a path we wish they followed. We can just do our best at education.

Also creating artificial brakes (state regulation) can have a catastrofical outcome.

We saw above how regulations make it even harder for the poor and also creates inflation. There is another problem too, everytime you regulate, you kinda give way part of your freedom to the state. And then its very easy for us to become slaves and live in an authoritarian place. 

No matter what we do, even then we wont be able to fix all problems, because resources are still limited.

My recommendation for people who want to LIVE in a different world is take action in making the world a better place. This means taking responsability. This means sacrificing your weekends to do charity, or creating something the world desperitly needs. Even then things csn go bad, because tools can be used for good or for evil.

Anyways - just sharing a little of my beliefs in how the world actually works and how things arent as bad nor as good as they seem. 

So basically, we as society need to stop crying and start helping other people more.",1568729663,{},f0lu77i,False,t3_d12cru,False,True,t1_f0lp21s,/r/gaming/comments/d12cru/ive_been_working_on_this_falling_sand_roguelite/f0lu77i/,1568729664.0,1,True,[],False,gaming,t5_2qh03,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],Noisetorm_,,,[],,,,text,t2_ixxcc,False,,"One of the most popular modpacks right now is SevTech: Ages and in it you progress through several technological ages and you're gated from accessing higher tier technologies before you get through the lower ages. You know how in Vanilla you get a wood pick, then a stone pick, and then an iron one all in about 5-10 mins? Yeah, this is gated to make sure you go through the stone age, then through all the ages until you can do space exploration. I heard this was more of a long-term modpack though and I'm sure it's certainly do-able with 3-4 people. Keep in mind that this pack has a progression similar to Terrafirmacraft, which means that you'll be making things like rope, twigs, etc. to start instead of the good ol' breaking trees to get planks to get sticks. 

Personally, I think the Tekkit Classic experience is way different than any of the modern packs so you could honestly return to that if you wanted to. I tried to but what turned me off was the 1.2.5 version of Minecraft. I just found this [1.7.10 version of the Classic](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/classic-reborn-1710.471011) though. The new mods are honestly super OP and as a result, don't have the satisfaction of finally getting your IndustrialCraft setup right after your machines blow up 3 times. 

Enigmatica 2 (Expert and non-expert) both offer linear progression through quests if you want it. It's not gated like Sevtech, but it does force you to go through every step and part of the mods if you play on Expert. It is 100% based on automation, in fact it's pretty much impossible to beat Expert without automating everything that leads up to that point. Expert has *very* difficult recipes whereas non-Expert mostly preserves the recipes the mod author gave it. It combines the classic Tekkit experience of having basically a Vanilla world but with mods to make it better. 

I'd also recommend Sky Factory 3 (I didn't really like 4) and Stoneblock. Both are the same genre--you start with nothing but a tree but you have to make your way through all the quests and to do that requires automation throughout the way. Unlike Tekkit which had a bit of exploration and terraforming the world with Buildcraft, this has a lot more of an emphasis on having a self-contained base that you can see grow linearly over time. This also means that these two packs can't be played indefinitely like the others with open worlds can. Stoneblock has Industrialcraft but Skyfactory doesn't.

If you do return to modded Minecraft, one of the first things you'll notice is how out of date IndustrialCraft 2 feels. You'll pretty much work around it in most modpacks because the recipes are complicated, the machines are slow, and the whole transformer system just means your machines blow up if you mess something up. EnderIO and Thermal Expansion (the two big tech mods) are better in basically every way except for IC2's nuclear reactor. Enigmatica 2 is probably the closest to your taste. I'm not sure about non-expert, but with Expert mode you're forced to go through IC2 to get to the later stages.

Do note that Enigmatica 2 takes quite a bit of RAM to run (probably need to dedicate 5GB) so you'll probably need to install a few things like Optifine and OpenJDK as a replacement to regular Java to reduce RAM usage if you have 8GB.",1565322560,{},ewefk63,False,t3_cnsibf,False,True,t1_ewedwj8,/r/gaming/comments/cnsibf/vanilla_minecraft_vs_ptgi_e8_textures/ewefk63/,1565322561.0,1,True,,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],Noisetorm_,,,[],,,,text,t2_ixxcc,False,,"Modded Minecraft is a different game than regular Minecraft honestly since it's all about automation. In order to automate the production of an item, like say, iron ingots, you're going to need machines and those machines are going to need power. In real life, when we make machines we'd normally deal with things like voltage and amperage and the items we use have resistance, lose power over distance, etc. If we were to try and translate that to videogames, we could, but it wouldn't be very enjoyable or even practical in most cases. So to replace all of that and simplify everything, we use some sort of energy unit like RF (Redstone Flux). If you plop down a machine, say something that quarries an area to get iron ore, you can just feed it 80 RF every tick (a tick is 1/20th of a second in Minecraft) and it'll do that for you. In-game machines generate RF/energy by various ways like from burning coal/wood in a generator, using solar panels, wind mills, etc. The whole modded energy system is more akin to how steam works in real life--you feed something 2 liters of steam a second and your machine now has enough ""power"" to thresh cotton. Of course in real life, it's not as simple because your electric toothbrush will take a certain amperage, say 3 Amps which can be achieved with 1 AA battery, but will take a higher voltage, like 2.5 or 3 Volts to run. 

Mods have their own energy units depending on what the mod author thinks is an appropriate unit of power storage although RF (and now more commonly known as FE) has basically been the standard unit of energy for modded Minecraft since forever. Some mod authors try to balance their mods by using a different unit of energy. A mod called Botania uses Mana and that forces you to follow that mod's progression while I can use RF in virtually any mod. I did mention IndustrialCraft 2 and that mod was and is a pain in the butt since its machines can't be powered if you don't use its own wires and explode if you send too much energy (the rest of the mods don't do this). 

Modded Minecraft comes in a lot of varieties and me talking about machinery and 10 different types of energy units shouldn't scare you away from trying it. There are modpacks (versions of Minecraft with 2-300+ mods) that completely skip the machinery and automation and focus on exploration and adventure [Hexxit]((https://www.google.com/search?q=Hexxit&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5qr_I1PTjAhXjHDQIHRvADDMQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=966&amp;dpr=1)).

Back in the 80s to 90s, I would say indeed most people saw gaming as a waste of time and money on par with frequenting bars and drinking only without the social aspect. This was mostly due to the narrative of media at the time and older folks hating on ""that there fangled technology"" as that was the same view most people had about the internet until the mid to late 90s, just the internet asserted itself as a powerful tool that you couldn't ignore, where as games you could ignore.

Now come the late 2000s to today. Sure those ""games are just a waste of time"" people are still out there, and sure there is something absolutely fair to say many of us ever indulge to the detriment of to a healthy life balance, but I find that perspective to be the minority these days considering gaming has become a common pass time in almost all age groups with 70+ being the only age group where gaming is sparse.

Which got me thinking - what video game characters would you want your Alexa / Google Assistant / other voice service to sound like? Here's my personal list:

2. Jim Raynor (Starcraft) - A guy with some attitude and a drawl, but ultimately someone you know will have your back

[],ijakinov,,,[],,,,text,t2_hco1g,False,,"&gt; ""Not that tedious"" isn't exactly a selling point. And when you can go from ""Not that tedious"" to ""Not tedious at all"" that's what people are gonna pick.

I wouldn't even describe it as tedious it's more like mildly inconveniently. Arguably it's mildly inconvenient to have to deal with setting up the automation for TV servers or having to download stuff manually but there's the whole free aspect heightening the attractiveness; and there are people who are entitled, cheap, or poor.

&gt; There is virtually no technological hurdle to presenting lists like that. It's the work of two days for an engineering team. There's no new tech here, the data's already there. They just don't want to present it in an easily digestible format, likely because their studies show that they can get people watching the things they want them to watch that way, not necessarily what people were looking for. It's a bit Machiavellian, but I have no doubt it's based in numbers. Everything Netflix does is.

It's not about technical hurdles, they already even have APIs to do it, you can do it on their website (it's hidden). It's that it's likely low priority low benefit work. It's not like flipping a switch either it has to be integrated into the design, and implemented across a bunch of different applications using different frameworks/languages. They just probably rather work on something else and probably won't hire new people to get these kinds of things done earlier.

&gt; And again I disagree here. I don't have to prove shit to Amazon. They have to prove to me they've got a service worth paying for. That's their job. If they can't do that, they're failing at it.

Arguably they can prove that, but it's hard to get them to actually put in the money when they can still get the product without actually spending the money by doing a few google searches. My point is more so that if we don't put money in the industry because people decide subjectively and arbitrarily that streaming everything possible should be dirt cheap and be consolidated; we are going to end up with an undesirable industry which will lead to less content. I would agree with you that in other industries it's more upto the companies to provide the better product/service to entice people to spend but those are fairer circumstances where people can't get essentially bit by bit copies of the product/service.

&gt; Nah, not anymore than TV. It's the same process.

I don't know if they improved the tooling for pirating music but downloading a bunch of torrent albums to pick out specific songs to build 100-1000 song libraries is a pain in the butt. A lot of people also rip music from YouTube nowadays, then you still end up without metadata and shittier versions of songs. You can probably build a library of all your favorite shows in probably 30 minutes if you wanted to. Depending on how big your library is it's probably going to take much longer to build out your music library.

&gt; Of course they do, and for the same reasons. Some records you're going to get and listen to immediately, then never think about again. Some you're going to get and put on the shelf for when you're in the mood. Some you're going to listen to over and over and over again. TV and movies are the same way. There's whole communities dedicated to watching The Office over and over again or falling asleep while Futurama's on. No real difference there.

Let me rephrase. I'm not saying there's no benefit to having a library, I was trying to say there's no significant benefit to building out *large* libraries of TV shows. By that I mean, they probably aren't going to try and get 100-1000 show (not episodes but shows) libraries. they are probably just going to pick the shows they care about (you only download music you care about but people tend to get a lot of it), episodes get auto-downloaded and they have whatever shows they have their 5 rewatch shows already all downloaded. My whole overall point is that TV pirating is already pretty easy. Music pirating can involve a lot of time to get the kind of access that people might want. And so, Spotify arguably solves a bigger problem. 

Also, building out a giant TV or movie library is pretty easy nowadays too. You can even automate the download of shows and movies from themed curated lists (channel, originals, actors. directors, wide-release theater movies, top IMDB, etc.).

&gt; Is that a pipe dream? Yep. The streaming services have zero interest in consumer benefit. They saw what Netflix built, wanted a piece of that pie, and, like most large corporate entities, the driving theory is ""Some is good. All is better."" So now we've got a plethora of streaming services all trying to kill each other, an annoyed customer base, and it's soon to reach a breaking point.

I think it's more complicated than that. The companies are either both major distributors/producers of content already (Warner, Universal, Disney) or at least major distributors (Apple, google, Amazon). They have multi-million/billion dollar business units dedicated to distributing or creating content. Those business units will soon be obsolete as more people don't want traditional TV or content a-la-carte. They don't really want to shutdown their big distribution units and they don't want to rely on Netflix finite budget in order for their productions units to eat. 


I don't know if the streaming services are actually trying/expect to kill each other but they definitely want to win. Disney pretty much said to investors they didn't see themselves as a Netflix killer and that it was just a move to go direct to consumer. Netflix said they expect Disney and others to do super well and expect significantly more to competition. I think they all expect/hope that this industry grows, that people spend more money on TV than before because there's so much more and better content.  TV has really evolved in the last decade; as there's a lot more premium high budget shows nowadays with big movie actors, writers and directors doing TV shows nowadays; and I assume TV consumption is significantly up with how popular certain shows get.",1568323823,{},f025rdu,False,t3_d2xjot,False,True,t1_f00tlmk,/r/television/comments/d2xjot/roku_drops_12_and_netflix_drops_3_after_apple/f025rdu/,1568323834.0,1,True,[],False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's go back in history.

Proving that people can have jobs that don't exploit their labor force. Americans enjoyed the fruits of that labor for decades where they had the strongest middle class in the world.

Sweatshops have moved to foreign markets where workers are exploited all over the world. More and more USA jobs are moving to exploit these workers, while we shift towards automation, causing the middle class jobs in the USA to shrink behind the rest of the developed world.

Season 4: must be willing to hurt innocent people in order to achieve his goals...even if those people are those in your own family. And must be willing to exploit the emotional weaknesses of others.

Season 5: realizing that you actions are hurting the people you love emotionally and that you need to leave behind the life for good. 

Season 6: realizing that he cannot escape the consequences of his past actions and that your hubris has destroyed your entire family, and that you only did it because he wanted to relive his childhood as a sepratist child soldier and not because of providing for his family.

people are measured in metrics, turnover is high and most people only work there because they can't get another job, the other jobs they can get are objectively worse or they're a seasonal worker.

that's really it. no one in their right mind goes to work at a warehouse when literally most other jobs pay the same or better without the backbreaking work and continuous push for better performance unless they have no other choice.

so, it's not particularly weird that a lot of really big companies in the third party logistics world like Amazon, DHL and Schenker are all investing heavily in automated warehouses. that means that we can remove the ""only paid because we have no better option"" people from the warehouses, and our society that heavily depends on that work being done can see even better results.

[],MellowHallow,,,[],,,,text,t2_b7w5z,False,,"&gt; What will there be to do if 80% of life is automated?

Whatever you want that you're qualified to do. If you offer your labour for free you will always be a cheaper alternative to robots.

&gt; Why do you think an automated society is practical?

Because eventually robots will be able to do the vast amount of work better than humans and for less money than it costs to pay a person to do the job.

&gt; Why do you think everyone will be happy to work for free, or even want to work for free?

You're the one with the theory that humans need and want to work. Personally I think most people won't, but if you're right then they get to fulfill that ""need"" and want by working for free.

&gt; How will non-automatable services be provided if those who benefit from them are now not making money? How will automated services be provided?

Obviously once automation reaches a certain point we have to decide whether we want to provide people with the money to survive, abolish the concept of money all together, or allow large portions of society to starve. I'd like to think if we went for the third option then we'd have a revolution on our hands, but who knows. Personally I find the idea of allowing all those people who inevitably won't be able to find paid work because robots can do everything they're qualified for cheaper and better to starve is fairly immoral and repugnant, but hey, that's just me.

&gt; Illustrate a scenario where a product or service can be fully automated from beginning to end without any human involvement or monetary need.

[],Dr__Douchebag,,,[],,,,text,t2_hudr1,False,,"You're making a classic automation argument. This'll has actually been around for over 200 years

Let me give you a historical example. 

Long ago, and for thousands of years, most people had to farm in order to feed the population. At any one time, about 90% of the population were farmers. The rest were skilled labor of some sort, like cobblers, black-smiths, shipwrights, etc.

This went on as the default until something evil came along, automation. With the invention of the gasoline engine, steam power, and farm-automating machines like the cotton-gun, it suddenly became possible to farm for a whooooole lot of people. 

For most of history, people farmed to feed themselves primarily, and anything left over they'd sell. But now, with automation, a single family could farm enough to feed a small city!

In fact, the number of farm jobs went down from roughly 90% of the population, to a mere 2% of the population today!!!

And it's been terrible every since, with 88% of the population being jobless every since automation ruined their livelihoods, right, right?

Oh wait, that's not what happened. Instead, the freeing up of those jobs allowed people to invent industries that previously were too expensive. People moved into manufacturing of all sorts, into service industries, into computer programming, and a thousand other occupations that had never existed.

But if you were a farmer in the 1500's and someone told you that soon 88% of all jobs were going to be eliminated due to the gasoline engine arriving soon, you might conclude what some alarmists are concluding now, that most of the population is going to be out of a job.

What they could not see is that farm automation too decades, and that it was not sudden and catastrophic, rather it created pressures that people responded to, and found jobs without radical pain in the economy.

The same is going to happen now. We may face automation pressures, but automation represents a large capital investment. The reason a person can still get a factory job is because you can hire them for a couple thousand a month, whereas a robot that can do their factory job might cost $300,000 up-front.

What's more, with AI coming, the most important jobs will be impacted first. AI will be great for helping your doctor give a correct diagnosis, you won't start with an AI taking out the garbage or chopping wood. Knowledge and identification tasks will be among the first, not to be replaced, but to be augmented. Doctors will be the ones that own these expert systems, they don't get replaced by them. And it means better service at lower cost for everyone.

Over time, even if we imagine that every existing job gets replaced by AI, it does not mean there is no work left to do, because there is in fact no limit to human desire for want-fulfillment.

Meaning that new jobs, new needs will arise, giving people opportunity to earn income. All machines will require a point of human responsibility, for instance. Perhaps many jobs will shift to becoming that point of human responsibility. You might get a job as the manager of a factory, and your sole responsibility is to oversee production and be responsible for a whole factory of machines that can largely oversee themselves.

Farmers do the same thing today, today the harvester and columbine are GPS-driven devices that do everything automatically by the hundreds of acres, and the farmer sits in an air-conditioned cab and reads Homer.

Automation will make life better, it will not replace all jobs or ability to earn income, and this has all happened before, and it is not different this time.

Life for everyone will get better. Living costs and prices will go down. Everyone's standard of living will go up. The same happened in the machine-tool industry. Instead of one-man running a lathe and making parts, today one man programs seven automatic-lathes that automatically make parts.

,Mr_Blinky,,,[],,,,text,t2_cmrng,False,,"The funny (read: depressing) thing is that a society like ours becoming fully automated *should* be a good thing, possibly even the best possible outcome. The less jobs that require a real human to do them, the less people will *need* to work, allowing for more leisure time and opportunities for humans to focus on things that robots *can't* do as well, like arts, entertainment, education, etc., all things that most people would say are net positives for both society and individuals. A utopian society like the one shown in, say, *Star Trek* is theoretically totally possible, a society where work is something you do for fulfillment rather than because without it you'll be left to starve on the street.

Of course, that's not the way our capitalist culture works, because your only value to society at large is what you can produce in labor and capital. As far as our society is concerned, if 90% of jobs become unnecessary due to automation that doesn't mean 90% of people are freed up to pursue self-improvement or leisure or what have you, it means that 90% of people are now *moochers* and shouldn't be given a scrap. Human life and experiences have no real value under capitalism, so the idea that we might be able free up the majority of people to simply live comfortably and easily rather than trying to force every able-bodied adult into a miserable 40-60 hour work-week is seen as distasteful and dangerous. We could easily have the technology in the next 50 years that would allow the vast majority of society to never have to lift a finger while still providing everyone with a comfortable and dignified life, but the mere *suggestion* that we could do so is, of course, dirty filthy communism/socialism/buzzwordism, and we all *know* we can't have that. Even if it became completely possible to support our entire species with the absolute minimum of human labor, it would never lead to widespread prosperity, just insane inequality, because the majority would rather let those who wouldn't or couldn't work starve to death on the street rather than let them get a ""free ride"".

,aphetto_grifter,,,[],,,,text,t2_3er79e2,False,,"Pete Buttigieg had some interesting things to say on the topic in his recent interview on Pod Save America. Here's an excerpt from the transcript:

&gt; It’s good to do training. I’ve supported a lot of training efforts in South Bend – it’s definitely part of the picture, but it completely misses why people are so harmed and so disrupted by this change. He completely misses why for example we had a so-called economic anxiety election in 2016 under conditions that most economists would describe as full employment. 

And what it misses is that even if we can find you another job with a similar income we haven’t really accounted for what happened to your identity. Peoples’ identity is wrapped up in this lifelong relationship with a single employer. By the way this is true for white collar workers and law firms and CPAs who are increasingly vulnerable to automation just as it is for blue collar workers in auto factories in Indiana for example. So what we’ve got to do is not only on kind of the technical and economic side be investing way more in R and D on A.I. and making sure that you know productivity growth increases in the U.S. so that overall wealth can grow but also something that is much more intangible project of helping people understand where they fit in the world. 

When you know anybody my on average my age or younger will change professions more frequently than my parents change job titles. And that’s something that can’t be solved by economic policy alone. I think there are some solutions. In my view, the solutions include things like community itself. So a lot of people who have found a sense of meaning even as jobs come and go. They found a sense of meaning based on the role they play in the city in the recovery of the city. They become sort of militantly attached to the mission of bringing our city back from the so-called Rust Belt doldrums. 

But that sense of community identity and purpose can come from a lot of places. It can come from faith. I mean at risk of sounding conservative – it can come from faith or family. And if we’re not speaking to that then I think we’re missing, we’re allowing this void to open up and I think by the way that void is being filled by some hideous things, medically hideous things like like opioids or morally hideous things like like white nationalism, which will rush in to fill that void.",1551739480,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehstfph,,t3_ax4fg4,,True,t3_ax4fg4,/r/television/comments/ax4fg4/automaton_last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver_hbo/ehstfph/,1551739482.0,1,True,,False,television,t5_2qh6e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that case they'll work with you to see what is reasonable to find, ""Three beds and a garage is going to be tricky.  We might find that in another town, though two beds and a garage or three beds is reasonable.""

In parallel you'll get pre-approved for a mortgage if you need one.  This is a bank saying ""If what you told me is true I'll give you a loan.""

When you find a place you put in an offer as well as some earnest money (term may be a bit off).  This is a small piece, usually a couple hundred, that goes towards your down payment.  Your offer depends on a lot of terms, and is where a realtor can help if it's not a standard transaction.  Usually you have a series of ""outs"" such as ""house has to pass inspection, my loan has to be approved, and I need a buyer for my current place."". If any of those fail you get your money back, if you fail to do what's needed from you they keep that money.

Once that's all squared away you get the bank to approve your loan.  Usually that's just them running a credit report and taking documentation about your income.  They'll usually do an appraisal on the house, and you'll have an appraisal clause in your offer.  That's just to ensure you don't spend $250k on a place that's worth $175k.  Appraisals are no big deal as if the house comes in under you just go back to the seller and say ""hey, appraisal came in at X, I can't get a mortgage at Y price, but I'll be happy to buy it at X.""

Next comes the purchase and sale agreement and more money into escrow.  The P&amp;S is the contract that details specifically what you're buying and sets a date for the actual sale.  It's a terribly boring document full of legalize.

On the sale day you meet at a town building, mine was the registry of deeds, with your lawyers.  You spend about 15 minutes signing a ton of documents, the lawyers leave to file the paperwork, and you get a set of keys to your new home.

That's how it worked in my state (MA).  Might change slightly depending on your state but I've been told it's about the same everywhere in the US.

Oh, and around the time you finalize your mortgage you setup insurance.  They usually work with your mortgage provider so that the cost is added to your mortgage and the bank pays the mortgage company.  Bit of a win-win as you only need to pay one bill and the bank requires you to keep a certain amount of coverage to keep your loan (if something happens and the place is lost they want to make sure they still get paid).",1569797285,{},f1xeio0,False,t3_dau1vp,False,True,t1_f1wcbhy,/r/television/comments/dau1vp/for_20_years_house_hunters_has_been_reliable/f1xeio0/,1569807440.0,2,True,[],False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],HarleyWeaver,,,[],,,,text,t2_tblwi,False,[],"That's a pretty good analogy. IMO, the buck *started* with Boeing (#1) when they tried to adapt an existing airplane to a very different engine, which changed the handling characteristics, and then (#2) tried to use software to make it handle the same as previous models, so that (#3) pilots currently certified to fly any 737 would be able to fly the Max without needing to go through additional training (#4) at airline expense, and (#5) the FAA let Boeing get away with it. 

But the buck *stops* in the cockpit. The vast majority of Max flights were incident free. Pilots who know what they're doing wouldn't have encountered the runaway trim condition in the first place. 

**BUT** as a long time 737 pilot points out, we are going to see more and more airline pilots in the future, with weak stick-and-rudder skills, and low hours, who know how to ""operate"" aircraft, but aren't really that good in terms of airmanship. 

That's just the way it is. And the aircraft makers and airlines will have to recognize that, and build bullet-proof automation systems in light of that fact. 

Generally, older pilots prefer the Boeing cockpit, because it acknowledges a traditional cockpit, where both pilots have the same feel on their controls.

### Conclusion

Automation is a major influence on the economy and will continue to be over the next decade. In theory, automation can lead to significant benefits for the whole economy. Greater GDP, higher productivity and increased customisation of the consumer experience. However, there are legitimate concerns about how these gains will be distributed. It is tempting to dismiss all concerns of new technology as the old Luddite fallacy. But, there is no guarantee that displaced workers will be seamlessly integrated into a very different labour market.

But, on the other hand, it would be a mistake to be too pessimistic. Past trends in automation have served the economy well. Who would go back to a time of 1 million people working as coal miner or 90% of the population growing their own food?

People in the '60s would've thought it bogus that people of the future would live on space stations and listen to the Beatles, but that's what happens on the ISS today

- The fact multiple technologies will converge and enhance each other.

I.e. progression of automation, but no transhumanism (biological or bionic); transhumanism but no automation (*Deus Ex* of all franchises is actually guilty of this and has never explained it AFAIK); GATTACA-styled enhanced humans with rigid bio-hierarchies between workers and owners, but no automation rendering a worker race obsolete even when robots &amp; human-level AI clearly exist; casual space colonization complete with human pioneers risking their lives creating colonies on other planets despite it being easier, cheaper, safer, and more practical to remotely build colonies ahead of time; people using advanced technology either for their intended purposes, for nefarious purposes, or accidentally screwing it up in an easily fixed way— never using sci-fi tech to play jokes or troll others or being so incompetent that an entire planet stops functioning for a few hours; etc. etc.

Are those reasons historical and only historical? How about the lower IQ and time preference of those people lead to them making poor decisions that lead to worse life outcomes?

&gt;Whites generally occupy both ends of the spectrum, and generally get benefits from being part of the majority

Why shouldn't the descendants of those who built the nation inherit the most benefits from it? They have the friend and family networks there since birth to get ahead, to criticise this merely tells me that immigrants should never have been allowed in because they will be at a disadvantage by not having these. It's a beyond stupid argument to even discuss this, every people in every nation reap the rewards of this, it's only European nations that hate ourselves enough to punish ourselves for it.

&gt;ealthier folks in stable homes commit less crime. White are heavier represented there, and that effects your statistics. Latinos and blacks are heavier concentrated in cities, and it's worth noting that per capita crime rates tell us that it's concentration and not specifically race. Poorer states have higher rates of crime per capita.

There is a stronger correlation between crime and % of population who are black than there is between crime and socio-economic status.

&gt;We can still measure the rate of crime, even if it's not reported.

You really can't you can only make estimates. 

&gt; a second reason I mentioned the Sweden example is due to the generally more positive results between police and immigrants/refugees. We see the same pattern there despite very different factors. We also get evidence to what increases crime rates, chiefly isolation, perceived oppression, and radicalization. 

Sweden has an increasing crime rate. For all the ""positive"" some programs do, the people committing crimes need not be there in the first place. How many women raped every year is worth it for the ""benefit"" of diversity? Of course people feel isolated in a nation they have no connection to by neither blood nor soil and when universities and politicians are ramping up rhetoric around ""white supremacy"" of course people feel oppressed whether it's justified or not. 

Everything else you are saying is just reasons we shouldn't have so much immigration, they bring problems. You want programs for them but programs are an expense that we otherwise don't need and why bother? There's not benefit to the nation and a nation is more than an economy, a nation is a people. And right now Americans aren't a people. Blacks feel like they are oppressed and held down by white people when they are held down by their own inability to keep up with a civilisation around them and for the most part they will never fit in. Latinos have their own culture they clearly prefer over that of America, they speak their own language, form their own enclaves, hire exclusively within their own ethnic group and are a net cost to society. Leaving only whites to foot the tax bills for everything. You know why universal healthcare will never take in the US? Because white people are already bearing the cost of nearly everything, you think they want to pay for Mexicans to have more children than them and have drunk driving accidents?

&gt;ealthier folks don't either, and even incentives don't really work, like we see in Australia. Cutting it off won't help, you'll get a spike in inflation as prices increase instead and increase the rate of automation leaving less time to adapt to the changing market demands

My intent isn't to sound defensive, and I understand that there are definitely jobs out there that don't require school, and that there are also college programs that don't adequately prepare people for the workforce. So I welcome whatever thoughts you might have!

However, my understanding is that jobs requiring a college degree are growing substantially faster than those that don't. Part of this is because more people (in the USA, at least) have college degrees than ever before, which actually reduces the value of a degree--kind of like inflation. But it's also because Education, Healthcare, Business Services, and STEM fields are growing rapidly, while many non-degree requiring jobs are slowing due to automation, outsourcing, and other factors.

Also keep in mind that just because something taught in school isn't directly applicable to a post-school job doesn't mean that learning about it is pointless. Think about taking high school history, science, and art classes. Very few people use those skills in their day-to-day life, but I'd argue they're still important subjects to understand.

I think the primary problem relating to this that needs immediate addressing is how people are paying for post-high school education through loans they can't pay back, and closely related to that is that the cost of college has more than doubled since the 80s, even accounting for inflation.

Wealthier folks in stable homes commit less crime. White are heavier represented there, and that effects your statistics.
 Latinos and blacks are heavier concentrated in cities, and it's worth noting that per capita crime rates tell us that it's concentration and not specifically race. Poorer states have higher rates of crime per capita.
 As for crime reporting, these people live in a society, they are not off in an isolated island. Plus part of the reasons for these programs is to build trust in those groups. We can still measure the rate of crime, even if it's not reported.
 Further, a second reason I mentioned the Sweden example is due to the generally more positive results between police and immigrants/refugees. We see the same pattern there despite very different factors.
 We also get evidence to what increases crime rates, chiefly isolation, perceived oppression, and radicalization. Here the source for that radicalization would be gangs. It's noteworthy that the perceived oppression comes from commentary of politicians, and the recruiters meet them by capitalizing in that rhetoric.
 The reason those stats would be driven up is because of that. If they're already going to be out to get you, at least the gang is going to protect you, or at least claim to.
 Happens a lot in prison, gangs of all ethnicities recruit by promising to get you set up after jail.
 It's true of Latino gangs and of white ones like the Aryan brotherhood, but what makes it particular appealing is that, as report after report has shown its already the case that being a minority starts you off on the back foot.
 Finally, look population isn't a problem, it's a resource to make use of.
 In the past we had the New Deal and the GI Bill, the latter which is credited with making the middle class we had in the decades following (though it was denied to certain people for reasons) We don't really have those programs anymore, though some programs were opened for small towns left devastated by closing plants or companies that pulled up and left or folded. 
 I'd love for a version of a New Deal to handle the infrastructure overhaul we need. Work programs with added education or skill training benefits would be great. Especially focused on fields where we do bring in people from overseas to do the work. Skill training and a bonus to companies that hire these people would be a good start, though it'd be a slow build up. 
The US is designed around a growth population. Problem is people don't have as many kids as they used to. Money is part of it, but not the whole of it. Wealthier folks don't either, and even incentives don't really work, like we see in Australia.
 Cutting it off won't help, you'll get a spike in inflation as prices increase instead and increase the rate of automation leaving less time to adapt to the changing market demands. It won't roll us back to say, the 50s because that boom was mostly predicated on how the war ruined most worldwide industries. Which no longer really require the US, reflecting in our trade patterns. 
 
 Shortly, it doesn't fix what it claims to, long or short term.

This entire thing is null and void imo because when you compare the crime rate of latino kids to the US at large you get one result. If you compare it specifically to the white community you get another. Conviction rates show that latinos are less criminally inclined that blacks, more than whites. It makes sense they may be lower than ""average"" when average is heavily skewed.

 To your point about menial labor, look they bring these people in because the businesses want the cheap labor. They can't easily make money paying citizens what they'd require to do it so they bring these people in.
 And speaking as someone who works in a factory and seen automation roll in, it gets expensive enough and they'll find a way to automate it.
 I definitely would like to see higher fines and punishments made for the people who bring them in (especially the ones that cancel the work visas without notice and leave the workers stranded, met a bunch of those heading out to Vegas)
 The company I work for has steadily shrunk its labor force while increasing its production.
 Walmart is phasing in robots for basic product checking, and those are only going to get more sophisticated. There are already machines capable of doing much of basic menial labor that just aren't currently cost effective.

The quote from the OP article is also a ""No Standing"" argument and is found on pages 12-13.  From my understanding, this type of brief where you try every possible option (no matter how morally questionable it might be) is completely normal.

I doubt this would even be getting any media scrutiny except for two things.  One, the current political battle on how to respond to illegal immigration.  Two, the fact that it's another example of cops seemingly possessing a license to kill because of DA 'ineptitude'.  As in, none of the cops involved were charged for killing him even though he died from a gunshot to the back of the head, which points towards execution and not the claimed self-defence.

What is the purpose of society?

What do we expect from it? How much of any thing is enough? How much of any thing do we need? What is the ultimate goal, the raison d'être of civil society? What is the purpose, motivation, the premises, the validation for our voluntary collaboration in such a complex system of hierarchies and methodologies and practices for distribution of values- material as well as social, physical as well as ethereal- who or what shall dictate, and under what mandate, which values ultimately steers our common will? What is the nature, agency, extent and limitation of our voices in that system? What are the explicit values to which we submit when we give up our self-determination as subjects to a common social hierarchy? Are they just?

These are truly profound questions the answers to which forms the basis for human civilization itself. And there is precious little time left to give them the serious and genuine consideration they require and deserve for us to reach once and for all a consensus on the one single question that humanity can not ever be allowed to cease to ask-

As long as we keep paying attention to him, we'll just keep letting the other hundreds of people that make the system work as it does stay the way they are.  

&amp;nbsp;

And let's play Devil's advocate for a moment and say that the president is not a showpiece.  The person we're most likely going to be putting up against the right is Joe Biden.  Even if you said he was the perfect candidate, which he's certainly not, he's got a significant chance of just up and dying or going totally senile.  Man is getting eye bleeds during speeches and losing focus during conversations and he's not even president.  He's generally not favored by alot of the further left, but is leading anyways.

&amp;nbsp;

Sanders isn't bad but his Green New Deal is not realistic.  It's got some good ideas spiritually but it's got things that make it unattainable like the fact our battery technology cannot support solar/wind being our mainstays and concerns of ethical material sourcing of the amount of materials needed.  My dad is really big into renewable and has been for like 15 years so I'm aware of these issues.  I feel like he'll overpromise and underdeliver and while progress is better than no progress, that almost makes me doubt a candidates true intentions.  However I feel like this will be taken advantage of by detractors and Sanders does not have the moxie to fight it, weather the storm, or to address/debate it away so when he screws up I think it's just going to stick.  

&amp;nbsp;

Elizabeth Warren is interesting because there is so much astroturfing involved.  I honestly know what to think because I've taken deep dives trying to get policy information on her from sources that are not directly on one of her subs or from somewhere like CNN that's playing it pretty shady around her for some reason.  I can easily find this sort of information on every other candidate but almost exclusively what I see for Warren when searching is the same glowing comments of ""she has a plan"", ""I like her because of her policy"", ""I want to live in her America"" and stuff that never actually line out her policy stances.  

So I do find policy comments on her, often from biased sources, but it's way more difficult than for other candidates and some of the things actually being outlined are not realistic like the breaking up of Google.  I don't think the government could break up google if it tried lol.  Google has become too powerful and they wield so much information that....let's just say cancel culture is a ready tool they could leverage if needed. Similarly a wealth tax would only be dodged and wouldn't even apply to stock anyways until time of sale....assuming you didn't bypass that tax as well :P.  Also that whole ""I'm native American"" kerfuffle with Trump was really dumb and she got called out by the Cherokee too.

[],Pantarus,,,[],,,,text,t2_9bm8v,False,,"We actually agree on a lot of individual points and there's some that absolutely won't see eye to eye on.

1) I 100% agree that immigration is being used as a scapegoat for changing times, changing industries, and automation. Coal mining started losing miners as technology changed allowing fewer men to operate far more powerful equipment. The nail in the coffin is cleaner, cheaper, and easier to obtain energy. But it's a lot easier to blame an immigrant than to accept that you need to change, are in a dying industry, and may need to accept a whole new way of life. But I also support diverting subsidies to help train, relocate, and assist people whose entire county will be devastated by the loss of an entire industry. They contributed for generations to this country and worked hard in difficult jobs that most of us wouldn't last a day in. We should over a boost to the next wrung of the ladder.

2) Although I'm a leftie I own several firearms. I'm pro-gun control in a sort of sweeping way. I believe that all firearm sales, private or through an FFL need to go through a background check, I believe a mental health records check for specific codes should be part of it. I also believe that (even if you don't have a felony) if you're convicted of several lesser crimes, that should add up to ""You're not a responsible citizen"" and shouldn't be allowed a firearm. I don't believe guns cause mass shootings, I believe they are a tool that's being misused. There is an endemic problem in the US, where there are sick people that desperately want to hurt others. Maybe it's a mental health issue...I don't have a solution. In the short term, I'm willing to peacefully hand over my AR if it becomes illegal. I'm not willing to completely disavow my 2A right altogether however.

3) This is where we separate first. I believe that until a certain point a fetus is just a non-living grouping of individual cells. I'm not religious so I don't believe in souls or that a life is instantly a life at conception, I don't believe there is anything sacred about it. I don't believe late term abortions should be legal unless it's an extenuating circumstance or the mother's life is in danger. That line in the sand should be up to OB/GYN's and experts to decide. I'm not experienced enough or know enough about the exact biology to give an opinion on where that line should be.

3) Pro-Birth Control 100% give that shit out like candy. Teach it in high school. Control teen pregnancies as much as possible. The problem I have with conservatives is that they want to teach abstinence (which statistically doesn't work) and still don't want abortions. I respect your opinion here, you can be pro-life...but then you shouldn't hamstring education on sex-ed.

4) I'm quasi-free trade. I do take issue with corporations taking advantage of lower quality of living standards of third world countries to effectively pay next to zero for labor. To me that's almost slavery, which does two things 1) Destroys the need for any US labor, increasing the scapegoating of immigrants 2) Because they pay so very little real wages to the third world country...it does very little to increase those people's standard of living at all.

5) Pro-Freedom Dividend: I agree with a universal basic income on a bunch of levels. First, we are a first world country and we need to set a minimum standard of living for our citizens. But that minimum, in my opinion, should be markedly below the living standard of someone working minimum wage. Which, minimum wage should be a living wage. Not 60 grand or anything, but you should be able to afford better than welfare standards if you are indeed working and trying to make it in this world. 

If you want to take that universal income and live on that, fine. But it won't be a high standard of living. I'd imagine anyone with any get-up-and-go won't be satisfied there and anyone without it, wouldn't have gotten past welfare life anyway. 

6) I'm for a wealth tax. Historically in the US, (lets call them the good ole days people keep trying to bring us back to) the wealthy were taxed much higher. You seem to have an Anne Rand view of billionaires, but even in her time there wasn't such a pooling of resources at the top. I don't think we should take everything everyone earns, but there comes a point where having that much money hoarded CAN affect innovation coming up from the bottom. The problem with capitalism is that it's basically a room full of spiders....at the end of the day...there's only going to be one left. 

Everyone should pay what they can pay. Ask not what your country can do for you type stuff. Once you reach a BILLION dollars...what are you spending that on? That isn't corporate wealth we are talking about, it's about individuals who have more money than some states. They'll still be filthy completely rich, to the point that their great-great-great-great grand-kids won't have to work or COULD even spend all that money while burning a 100,000.00 a day. That money could change the world.

7) Healthcare is interesting to me. For a selfish reason. I have kids. Eventually it has to happen. AS we progress as a society health care will become a human right. If I die tomorrow or my company decides to sell, or implode due to some CEO scandal, I shouldn't have to worry about my kids health. Nor should you. Nor should anyone. 

8) The student loan relief is one of those things that goes hand in hand with immigration. So in most developed countries, after passing a series of tests, their children get an education for free. Then they immigrate here and are now in competition for jobs with our students who are loaded down to the gills with debt. That's automatically putting our students at a massive disadvantage. Who knows what inventions are not being made or businesses not being started because someone said ""I can't afford this...why bother.""

I think if we free up education and make it a meritocracy we will be directly sponsoring our futures. BUT it has to be in areas that we need it. You want to go into fine arts? GREAT there are 20 spots open for the tops artists in the state. Go get em. After that, I believe you should be allowed to pay for it if you want it. Why should I stop you from learning what you wanna learn. But as a society we should be subsidizing engineers, scientists, etc.

I don't have all the answers by any means. Funny to see that there's tons of stuff we agree on, but it's these different nuances that separate us at the voting booth.

We can always choose to let more people in to America, but when climate change is in full effect and America is using its economic resources to save it's people, and there is mass migration due to changing climates, flooding, natural disasters, ect..., I would like the option to choose how many people can and cannot come into the country. I'm an engineer so there is an equation for everything, and there is obviously an ideal rate of immigration. There is nothing inherently anti-immigration with wanting more ability to control that rate. Andrew Yang is 100% right that immigrants are being scapegoated for automation. Both immigrants and automation are good for America. 

Pro-gun, a gun is a tool, I am an individual, and I trust myself to use that tool safely and more effectively than other individuals. When it comes to the collective verse the individual, equality verse liberty, the good of society verses the rights of the individual, I almost always fall on the side of the individual.

Anti-abortion, it is not a women's rights issue if you believe the embryo is a living human child. A mother does not have the right to kill her 1 month old baby, she also shouldn't have the right to kill a baby in the womb.

Pro-birth control, give this shit out for free. Private religious hospitals should be exempt.

Pro-free trade and pro-market, usually allowing the market to dictate what is in demand is good. However, on occasion, the government may need to guide the market in the right direction if the market is taking too long to accomplish a goal.

Pro-freedom dividend actually. So long as Yang follows through and eliminates most other welfare programs to help pay for it. The freedom dividend would make government welfare much more efficient. I don't really have a problem with the government utilizing the people's money, I just find it inefficient mainly because it is accountable to the people. Everything needs to be tracked and documented. Every regulation followed to the tee. That means that half the money for a particular program is probably spent on paper work and bureaucracy. Small start-up just do rather than think about doing. Much more efficient.

Anti-wealth tax, billionaires are actually some of the people who are most likely to innovate and create new technologies. There is so much knowledge and resources in the world, and billionaire actually have the money to access all of them and create a new technology much faster than a slow moving government or corporation.

Healthcare is an interesting one. My only really firm position on this one is that corporations should not be forced to pay for employee healthcare. Healthcare providers have no incentive to lower costs if it is mandatory that everyone has to purchase their product.

I would consider student loan relief only if we also stopped the gaurenteed federal student loan program. The fact that anyone and everyone can get a student loan regardless of risk, program choice, future earning potential of a degree (especially when almost all degrees cost about the same) is only driving education costs up.

People aren't exactly eager to start switching over to gene-vat reproduction and massive automation to create a society that can shrink stably over time so land becomes affordable again.  On an individual level most people would have to put an awful lot of money into land to even have room for planting three trees.  That wouldn't be economical.

[],captainloverman,,,[],,,,text,t2_4bwr1,False,,"Nope the argument is that the pilots reactions and thinking need to be understood. Training and experience deficiencies should filtered out. The move towards automation and reliance on advanced systems has seemingly far outpaced the piloting world. We can make a new and better plane, at some point we need to make a new pilot to fly it.

The Boeing philosophy has always been the ability for manual reversion, requiring solid stick and rudder skills. Airbus builds for automation and systems integration, requiring good systems management and cockpit organization skills.

Now we are moving to heads up displays, advanced radar, satellite navigation and datalink ATC. All electric airplanes. All composite airframes. We are introducing a ton of unknown variables that could cause an accident, incident, or mishap; the role of the pilot is to break the final link in the causal chain, last line of defense so to speak.  But we cannot do that without the right tool, and abstract example would be trying to atop and electric car by putting the transmission it in neutral. It would fail because thats not how things work, better to pull the parking brake.

Boeing fucked up by engineering the system the way they did. But if it had been designed with redundancy and self correction there would be zero problem. Theres nothing wrong with putting bigger engines on a plane, we have been doing it 60 years. Thats a fallacy that everyone is harping on about the Max. Its again a distortion. Airbus reengined its 320 into the NEO many less [problems](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-how-airbus-fought-its-own-pitch-battle-457574/ ) because of good software even though the same engineering challenge existed. If theyd blown up 2 NEOS full of passengers itd be grounded too.

The way I see it there are 4 major macro causes to this accident.

1. The cutthroat international political landscape for the commercial aircraft market, which, in this case required that Boeing rush to market a rehash of an old design to maintain market share with a subsidized competitor.

2. The management and engineering culture that produced a plane with an unsafe design flaw.

3. The regulatory capture and lax oversight that allowed this to get to the public and diluted any training that might’ve prevented it.

4. The crews inappropriate reactions and how they compounded a precarious situation that there was a chance to save. Why?

I care about the first 3 in abstract (the 1st will never be questioned as a causal factor because at that level the responsibility gets passed on).

A southern border with three jungle nations with a combined military three times that of China's with highly defensible jungle on their side alone. No really proapect of supply from Russian allies aross the Siberia and Gobi deserts. Their border with India is better since they aqquired Tibet as a geographic buffer but it still stands that the licals would likley side with an invading India, calling into question its use for purpose unless it is repopulated and supplies water for the two largest rivers in China's breadbasket - the pearl river delta. Finally for a country massively dependant on expirts it is surrounded by south korea, japan and other Nato friendly/allied nations with the US and guam of its east coast that can navally blockade exports and cripple its economy unless China manages to grab soverignty in the south China sea. It is in no geographical position to invade or go to war. Never has been historically for the same reasons. It's power is economic and maybe cyber (though with its reliance on exports this dampens any aggression they may have). So anyone who thinks China is a military threat should consider just how tenuous their position really is. You could argue ideoligical for sure, and maybe neocolinialism but atleast their belt and road initiatives are not a zero sum transaction for African nations unlike the similar but much more one sided IMF debt peonage practices inflicted on the Asian region after the financial crash in the late nineties. They don't seem to have 
and interventionist foreign policy, nor seem to be supporting or actively facilitating statebuilding and regime change abroad through the use of military force. Environmental policies? Seems a wash to me, both and exporting the lions share of rubbish abroad nowadays to look better with China investing more into green tech and the US backsliding on policy.

And, as has been pointed out, this automation is being introduced *solely* for the profit of the owners of these companies. The *true* 0.1%ers. The extra profits they are making are going to be extremely detrimental to the overall population.

The idea isn't to hold off the introduction of the automation technology itself, it is simply to make the profitability of it less profound and extreme. 

To put it simply (fully understanding that implementation would be *very* not simple), if you determine automation would increase profitability 20%, you put an 18% tax on that. Therefore it is still profitable, it is still worth implementing, but one of two things would happen: (a) companies would roll it out more slowly, as the profit motive would not be as extreme, so it would make sense to roll it out more slowly in order to minimize the inevitable bumps in the road when implementing mass automation (and possibly also to avoid the bad publicity of mass layoffs); or, (b) if they still dive headfirst into automation despite the thinner margins, it would pump billions to trillions into a UBI program almost instantaneously, giving the victims of the mass layoff an immediate safety net. 

Again, there are tons of details to work out, but I like this idea the most because it makes those who eliminate the jobs via implementing automation (and thus reap massive profits) pay for the UBI, and it fairly directly ties the funding/taxation for the UBI to the causation of the job loss.

The State dept under Trump has seen an exodus of careerist public servants, experts in nearly every topic area.  Here's an article from after the first year, when it had barely started:

Those vacancies in State represent a body of knowledge and comprehension of the world that is going to take literal decades to rebuild.  While that is taking place, other nations, not similarly crippled, will be taking advantage.  Notably, Russia, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia ... noticing a pattern?

The empty ambassadorships and the lack of effort to fill them also speaks of a deliberate effort to cripple the US soft power in the world.

If I can be forgiven a sports analogy, none of this gets fixed, because you don't sit out 1 out of 5 games in the world series and get to have a do-over.  Things will have happened, the US will have been absent during them, and it will return to the game late and trying to catch up while everyone is moving forward.

All of this and more than I can list are happening against a backdrop of multiple global crises, which Trump's admin has also held the US back from addressing - 

* massive wealth inequality, 
* automation and AI's impact on labor and the economy, 
* global warming, 
* the rise of right-wing fascism around the globe, 
* the ongoing eradication of the natural environment (insects, birds, oceanic ecosystems, biodiversity in general), 
* more

All of which have the potential to wreak havoc on the world if not managed.  Some qualify as extinction level events.

The US is effectively absent as a responder to these crises, and there will be no do-over.  Worse, some nations are actively working to worsen one of more of these crises, such as Bolsonaro's Brazil eradicating the Amazon.  The US under Trump is included among such nations.

&gt;As technology improves, workers will be able to stop doing the most dangerous, repetitive, and boring jobs. This should excite us, but if Americans have no source of income—**no ability to pay for groceries, buy homes, save for education, or start families with confidence—then the future could be very dark.**

I've seen it both ways, and that kind of rhetorical framing paints a picture but doesn't really address policy.

MW and UBI both aim to redistribute money to the poor, but through different mechanisms.  Reasons why UBI is better at this redistribution than increasing the minimum wage:

(1) UBI is available to those taking maternity and paternity leave, or otherwise doing domestic work that isn't counted in traditional labor transactions to which MW applies.

(2) UBI has the clear potential to pretty much [eradicate poverty](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1007270574656249856).  It removes the stigma of receiving money from the government (current welfare programs have time limits and other bureaucratic strings attached) and brings everyone right up to the poverty line, so everyone's basic needs are covered and any sale of labor only benefits each individual, thereby eliminating the [poverty trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_trap) that is incentivized by the current welfare system that removes cash payments once people get jobs.

(3) UBI allows more freedom to individuals to make life choices other than just selling their labor.  Since basic needs are effectively met, it is easier to start businesses, take mind-clearing vacations (which more Americans could use) and pursue other life goals.

(4) By contrast, MW redistributes income on the backs of all businesses (large and small) as a price floor.  A small increase might do more good than harm, but for larger increases, MW distorts the labor market and puts increased pressure on unemployment (see [rent seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking)).  Some small businesses just making ends meet will have to lay off some of their employees; other businesses will invest in capital instead and speed up automation.

Can you be more specific, what kind of administrator? A company may need some administrative oversight but with the progression of AI, you will see offices with 5 administrators go down to 1 or get rid of those 5 and divy up the few tasks that require a human to other parts of the office who’s jobs have also had a decrease in demand. Where as today an administrator may facilitate training, AI software will facilitate training. Where today administrator may take inventory of office supplies, a PO will automatically be submitted when Inventory needs replenished. So please elaborate. 

&gt; Codetermination giving workers the right to vote against such a policy and a matching exit tax on jobs and capital. Other forms of capital controls. We have to accept some capital flight, of course, because that's unavoidable, but if the frog is boiled properly, it isn't too much. That's why Warren's plans have to be viewed as a package.

That is so impractical it’s not even funny. Companies are bought and sold every day, no one at any company wants to lose their job but that often happens during a merger. You aren’t going to change that because that is often why people start companies, to sell them. You also would decrease the incentive for migration to the US for entrepreneurs. 

 Before I continue I just want to say- the crucial difference is you trust the government is better equipped to make decisions with money than you or me. I believe in closing tax loop holes, I believe Amazon should be paying taxes. However, the amount of waste and cost that goes in to social programs like SNAP or SSD is silly and less effective than just supplying people with a dividend. I want the money given to the people to decide what they do with it. You want the government to decide that for you. Warren is not positioning the country to handle massive job loss with automation. What is her solution for the 3.5 million truck drivers who will be out of work? Or the average retail worker? Or UPS truck loader? What are her solutions as this takes place over the next 5-10 years? 


&gt; I'm talking like if they leave it is still better for us than if they stay. Because these people are bad for all of us, and while I'd rather strip them of most of their unearned wealth before they can leave, I'm happy to simply strip them of some of that wealth and ensure that they never have any impact on US politics again.


Really? Unearned wealth? So Jeff Bezos didn’t put any work in to building Amazon? Elon Musk didn’t shower at the Y while working 80 hours a week on PayPal? I presume you’re typing this on a phone or laptop, how do you think you got this technology? Your view is so short-sided. You blame the entrepreneur when you should blame the legislators. Without Prosperity comes poverty, crime, lower education, less voting, higher disease, etc and you think eliminating the successful business owner will solve your problems. Who hires the employees to pay the taxes then? Less jobs/companies means less revenue, less revenue means less social programs.


&gt; Honey, I want to destroy the capital class. I'm not here to take from the rich and give to the poor, I'm here to take control of the institutions that the rich use to exploit all of us. Socialism is about power, not wealth, except insofar as concentrated wealth impacts power.


By institutions do you mean government or private sector workplaces? If you want to take control of government then just say you want to get corporate money out of politics- still isn’t socialist. How are you being exploited? If a business owner, who took the risk and started a business didn’t make more money than you, the guy putting tape on boxes, then there would be no incentive to innovate and develop anything. If the  engineer didn’t make more money than the janitor, why the fuck get an education? The long term effect of this is little to no development, lower production, lower wages and thus less tax revenue. Instead of just claiming you want a better tax system you are claiming you want to rid the country of its most successful people. They are paying the lowest taxes legally allowed by our tax code, it’s our own fault that we allow it. Instead of wanting to change faulty aspects of our legislation, you want to overthrow the capitalist class like it’s 1920s Soviet Union. You’re ignorant and you provide no actual solutions, just talking points from Marx’s manifesto, which was written at a time before industrialization, and long before human capital was becoming less and less necessary to produce goods/services, let’s alone  design and create goods/solutions.  


&gt; This accomplishes none of my goals. At best, it is simply no change at all. At worst, it empowers the capital class further by creating a class of failsons who have lost even the power of collective bargaining and now live at the mercy of the politics of the wealthy.


No change at all? Riigghhhtt, because no one cares about their ability to feed their child or pay their bills, it’s all just about power! No one is going to be collective bargaining in the economy of the future, you keep living in the industrial and pre- industrial era, where human capital was in high demand cut production. The amount of human capital needed to run a manufacturing facility now is 80% less than it was 80 years ago. Look at the new Tesla factory being  built in China for example.

In closing, you have changed the conversation from an economic one, to a social one. Nothing you say is remotely practical for the workforce of today and especially not for that of the future. You spew communist bullshit yet it’s all in theory because you have never been exposed to such a society. There isn’t a successful society on this planet that operates in the way you suggest (and I suggest you dint try and reference Nordic countries cause you will quickly be proven wrong). A successful society doesn’t stiffen innovation or development, it encourages it while proportionally bolstering the health and wellness of society. You can have capitalism while diminishing political corruption, increasing social good, and empowering healthy democracy. We will never make those improvements while idiotic extremists on both sides of the political isle, naively try to drive us off a cliff.

Capitalism is great and it's meant to be a meritocracy, but it doesn't work when you have the ultra wealthy (or huge corporations) suppressing the voice of the lil ppl (us) lol. That's all I was saying. 

2) So Yang has previously said of his democracy dollars plan that a federal program that allows every citizen to allocate $100 however they want to a local, state, or federal political candidate would wash out corporate donor money 7:1, I believe (it might have been more). So, as far as capital mobility goes, I can't tell you for certain what would happen. Nobody could. But taking corporate donor money out of politics (or minimizing it) would drastically change the political landscape for the better. Companies will always go where they want and do what they want, and there is nothing stopping state or local officials from offering incentives to keep them there. The relationship between businesses and the government *should* be organic, not quid pro quo up front i.e. you donate to my campaign and I give you favors. So I see your point, but I still believe it would have a significantly positive effect. In addition to giving people the power to allocate money a certain way, it would probably increase voter turnout as well. Never a bad thing

3) I completely see why you might think UBI is treating symptoms. I actually wrote a short paper on UBI for an economics class a couple years ago, and my conclusion was ambiguous. But take a second and look at the bigger picture - automation of labor is a very real thing. I live in a swing state and most people who worked in manufacturing know their skills are no longer applicable and they're being phased out. This is only slated to get worse over time - Yang has this thing he says where he explains why breaking up big tech is not an option (though he says we can force them to divest from some areas per antitrust laws) because nobody wants to use the 3rd best ride-hailing app or the 4th best search engine. As time goes on,  this phenomenon will get worse and even though it might not be reflected in the unemployment rate (which - as you might know -  doesn't properly account for workers who have been displaced or aren't looking for work). So, we will continue to see this situation where there are high-skilled jobs and then there are unskilled jobs, and the pay difference is very large, and when manufacturing went out the window, so did the middle class. The only proper way to address this problem are to either 1) allow people to struggle until they become educated or die, 2) outlaw machines taking jobs, or 3) accept that automation is good and will make us more efficient and productive, and find a way to help people who have been displaced or are struggling find a way to live with dignity, and either work an unskilled job below the poverty line or give them the ability (i.e. money) to actually transition into a new field or whatever. We know that 1) federal jobs programs statistically don't work 2) job retraining programs statistically don't work 3) you can make $15 an hour and still live below the poverty line.

It might SEEM like an all-too-easy, catch-all type problem, but giving everyone money is the perfect type of situation. The government would be great at sending a massive amount of checks to people instead of having expensive and frankly unoptimal application and verification systems like welfare currently has. The problem with any other system of redistributing money is that there are always too many complications, and it takes a lot of effort to figure it out. Just to address a couple of things you said - we do have a system where workers earn a fair wage, the problem is that there aren't enough people to fill the jobs that are currently required. Also, what you're talking about with democratic-type companies exist, they're called worker co-ops (different from a college internship co-op lol). And as for what you are saying about socialism and government owned means of production, you're mostly right. As far as the definition of socialism, you're spot on. You're also correct about how people with more resources will have leverage over those who don't. I disagree with your view that this is a bad thing though. There is a different between having a functional capitalist society that rewards meritocracy and has a hierarchy of wealth and status and a capitalist society where the rich suck the money and souls out of the poor people and strip them of their dignity. It doesn't have to be black and white - we can (and should) have a society with rich people who have done something or created something of value, we shouldn't allow them to control the lower populace. UBI, progressive income tax (higher than current, and moderate wealth taxes like warren has proposed would all help to achieve this. As far as authoritarian organizations go, this is a good thing. If you do some research on organizational power structures, you'll see that the best way to run companies efficiently is to have a hierarchy of leadership, whereas other groups benefit more from complete democracy. It just depends. I admire the way you view things (and definitely respect your opinion) but you *know* what you're suggesting is radical and it will never happen in our lifetime. The best thing to do is figure out a way to fit your ideals into solutions that can effectively benefit people in this current situation we have.

He did not say ""We can't talk about Donald Trump's crimes."" or ""We can't talk about his racism."" or ""We can't talk about his policies.""

He believes removing Donald Trump should be a priority but the message should be focused on the vision for the country rather than his bullshit. Because most of the people that hate Donald Trump aren't going to vote for him and the people that aren't paying attention aren't going to suddenly care about Trump's bullshit when they haven't cared for 3 years.

The better way to win in 2020 is to get people excited about a vision for the country that appeals to them and connects with them on a personal level.

[],JALLways,,,[],,,,text,t2_3l3vqhex,False,[],"I think that article is very flawed - its main complaint is that a VAT is the wrong way to fund UBI, and that a better way to fund it is through increasing the income tax more at the top.  The problem with that it's easy to escape, and rich people are super good at escaping taxes.  A VAT is very difficult to escape and it's self-enforcing.  In fact, it wouldn't even drive companies to relocate to different countries because if you want to sell to Americans, you have to pay the VAT.  This is why every modern economy besides ours has a VAT, and France and Switzerland even repealed their wealth tax because it didn't work.  

When combined with Yang's plan for UBI, it ends up being a net transfer of wealth from the top 5% of spenders to the remaining 95%.  Along with M4A, I consider that the most progressive position of all the candidates.

The writer goes on to claim that automation of jobs will be fine because it was ""fine"" for the last two centuries, and proposes stopping technology innovation as an alternative.  The first point is a logical fallacy, and the second is just not a good direction for the country.

From [Yang's Freedom Dividend FAQ on his website](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/):

&gt;Wouldn’t that cause rampant inflation?

&gt;The federal government recently printed $4 trillion for bank bailouts in its quantitative easing program with no inflation. Our plan for UBI uses mostly money already in the economy. In monetary economics, leading theory states that inflation is based on changes in the supply of money. The Freedom Dividend has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a Value-Added Tax.

&gt;It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or inapplicability – primarily housing, education, and healthcare. The real issue isn’t universal basic income, it’s whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce prices in different sectors.

Also:

&gt;Wouldn’t the Value-Added Tax just get passed on to consumers, “cancelling out” the UBI?

&gt;No.

&gt;First, not all goods will be subject to the VAT. Staples such as groceries and clothing will be excluded from the VAT.

&gt;Second, the assumption that the entire VAT would get passed on to consumers is incorrect. Consumers are price sensitive, and the demand for most goods is at least somewhat elastic. While prices will likely increase on many goods, the increase will, for the most part, be smaller than the VAT as producers find more efficient ways to produce goods and adjust prices to maximize profitability.

&gt;Finally, an individual would have to buy a lot of non-exempt items in order to “cancel out” the value of the UBI. Assuming all goods are subject to a VAT and the entire VAT is passed on to consumers, an individual would have to buy $120,000 worth of items before the extra costs associated with a VAT “use up” their UBI. As stated above, those two assumptions are wrong, and most people aren’t spending nearly that much money.",1569443254,{},f1ffag5,True,t3_d8y2r3,False,True,t1_f1fefeh,/r/politics/comments/d8y2r3/andrew_yang_says_teaching_people_financial/f1ffag5/,1569443256.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;He calls them Freedom Dividends FFS.

So what? It's just a dumb name to make it sound more appealing to people who wouldn't otherwise go for it. What the fuck does it matter what it's *called?* People aren't going to go for something called ""universal basic income"" because it *sounds* like you're getting money for doing nothing, while ""freedom dividend"" strikes at two points Yang needs to make: 1) American society is about freedom, and 2) this dividend gives people a little more freedom to do what they want to do.

&gt;When on the debate stage he never gets into *why* UBI is needed

He rarely ever gets *any* time on the debate stages, but when he does—and in interviews if you'd bother to listen—he gives specific examples of the types of people it can help: a waitress getting harassed at her job who doesn't feel financially secure enough to quit can now do just that, a family can get a little breathing room, a student can start paying back debts, someone could literally just buy a guitar and explore their passions. Yang has talked *extensively* about the benefits of UBI and how it's not just about giving people ""free money""; it's about the idea that life should be about more than making it to your next paycheck. It's about the pursuit of happiness.

&gt;he comes across as someone who is just promising money for power.

I disagree. To me—and again, I'm not voting for him and don't want him to be president—he comes across as a guy who sees the writing on the wall in terms of automation, UBI, etc and doesn't see other people talking about it so he's only on the stage to move the conversation. Personally I don't think he truly expects to win at all; I think he's just trying to solidify UBI as an idea people don't scoff at the same way Bernie managed to get M4A into the platform.

&gt;He's absolutely a joke and he hurts Democrats and UBI with the reckless way he campaigns.

Democrats are benefiting from Yang pulling in additional people who otherwise didn't give a fuck about the Democratic platform, he's promoting UBI at a time when nobody else is, he's talking about automation when nobody else is, he actually has *compassion* in a way that a lot of the candidates don't, etc. Yang is not some Jill Stein. He's a guy trying to make a difference. He's not a practiced politician so yes he has cringe-worthy moments more than he should, but his heart is pretty clearly in the right place.

For a ""liberal"" party that prides itself on a ""diversity"" of ideas and cultures, it is always depressing to me just how closed-minded the Democratic Party is and how fast they try to shut down anyone who doesn't fit their narrative. It's just like Bernie's run in 2016 all over again. These are the same arguments levied against him about how he's ""hurting"" the party and making universal healthcare into a ""joke.""

Hillary was never going to get Obama numbers, she had too many decades of baggage. Biden has quite a bit of baggage, but no where NEAR the amount of baggage Hill has. 

&gt;  and weaker in the north and Midwest, which lost her a ton.

Much of that because she never visited. Hillary was a horrible candidate, her whole, it's my turn attitude turned off many people. I voted for her as well, and will vote for Biden given he's the nominee, but I really hope he's not.

[],sledgetooth,,,[],,,,text,t2_aacwa,False,,"By my understanding, and what came to me in my state, was that all human expressions have merit and validity. It's only relative to a system of objectivity does something become deemed of more worth or merit than another. ""Respecting"" something is housed within the individuals identity. To me, respect for all beings is mandatory, because they're all deviations of the human consciousness and all have justification for manifesting on this plane. Its only once I'm in a less abstract, more deviated, more narrow state that I begin to emphasize more direct human emotions that would lead me to value one thing over another. It's necessary that we have these sorts of deviations and contempt for other ""ways"", if we didn't, it'd be near impossible to fight them. Hence why not everyone can know this ""truth"" if it is one. The system itself wouldn't allow for it. I used to think that Disney was a bunch of shit and people needed to grow up, or get more awareness. I know now that ""grow up"" is a term of conformity brought about by the external as a means to pressure someone into deviating relative to the expectations of the external, and that oftentimes that lack of being ""grown up"" directly opposes the efforts of the person making the case. There is profound wisdom in the identity of a child, and their experience of play. Even those who experience this largely into adulthood, like baby fetishists. 

""A child failing to realize the consequences of his actions doesn't have an informed opinion"" The consequences are herd designed, though. We agree upon them. If there is literal physical pain, you could call that wrong for a child. Yet there are still humans that exist that seek our pain and it adds a value to their lives.

What constitutes informed opinion is bits of collected understanding we've hallucinated into experience. The only information we can know is what we observe. We don't even know if the constants of our universe are constant. A childs expression has merit in the world, and as per where I think you're coming from, it has utility. There's science behind the positive effects of ""play"" on adults. The child is only uninformed relative to the conjured game of the society, its expression still has merit, even if the society opts out of implimenting it to large degrees. If we were all hedonistic and playful, we wouldn't be building rocketships to space. If we were all building rocketships to space, we would all miss out on the connection, creativity, and abstraction or hedonism and play (just as examples).

We respect people in many ways. Sometimes that means not thrusting forth what we think is right. Once we can recognize that our knowledge is observation, observation is sensory, perception, and perspective based, and that what ""definitive"" we are attempting to teach them is merely an opinion on ""the right way"", we stop asserting the narcissistic tendency to validate our opinion through its absorption by our environment. We can teach them of a potential avenue that they can try for themselves, but no shirt fits everyone. It probably could, with mass repression. Propaganda, cultural dogma, religion etc. get people to repress themselves all the time. 

The entire Western culture operates as a ""give a man a fish"" as opposed to ""teach a man to fish"". It still has roots in slave mentality. Sometimes I think unveiling certain wisdom is the way, sometimes I think society would cease to function if esoteric wisdom was given to the masses. Maybe once automation kicks in it'll be the right move. I could say we are disrespecting people by hiding truth from them, and I think that's generally fair, but again things like this are so circumstantial. Fundamentally, what humans are doing is unveiling and exploring, so ideally we should be receiving the peaks of both knowledge and lived experience. 

""Whatever differences exist between us everything can only ever be one way at once "" for the individual, and for cultures at large, yes, this is apt. There are subcultures that deviate parallel too. Entropy and nihilism, or tearing down the spire being built, these mentalities will exist, but they are obviously not the lead perspective. The lead perspective, depending on the times and where one is in the world, is subject to change, its just a question of when.

""Are we to con each other into going along with our separate wills or teach each other why what we've in mind would be really great? "" Depends how idealist one is. If ones adopting the psychopathic or sociopathic mentalities, yes its a con. Even the more idealist of us can be conning ourselves without our awareness, then project that outward onto others for further validation. I think what we can do is talk about our way, and our anecdotal experiences with it. If people become aware that things are only ""ways"", then propaganda has less power by design. Our perspectives on how life should be are completely opinion based, and people really need to know that, because we are constantly being influenced. The more conformed we are, the easier to lead, even if we are highly aware. You'd be amazed at how powerful marketing and dogma are to even the highly trained eye, they predicate on the unconscious. You will still be effected even with awareness of such things.

""to fail to make room for anyone is to do evil by that one"" Think deeply on this in terms of a universal system. You're basically echoing what I've been saying. That all manifestations of consciousness have merit within the universe. 

Too often people don't find the game they have a natural aptitude for, and cultural designs just depress them.

""But it's possible for one to possess such an integrated perspective and the other to not only fail to realize what that one knows but to insist on an uninformed position"" Even an uninformed has utility. I read a story about how many of the young militants in a certain army were some of the most brutal and savage of them all. They thought their way was the pure way, that they were benevolent, so that they could do no wrong, and that their enemy was pure vile scum. This ignorant justification allowed them to carry out heinous acts with ease, and given the circumstance, that's exactly what you wanted out of an army member at that time. Someone growing a conscious for others being ""human too"" didn't have its place in wartime. 

I've hit some heights with awareness, but I still see the utility in ignorance. It sets things in motion, and as I said in my original post, stagnation is the only true enemy that I can discern. 

People can integrate the perspectives of others. They can also manifest their own narrow perspective with great disregard of others, and assert their will unto the world. I'm not attributing opinion to these things, they're just observable. I imagine they both have utility or reasoning.

""the centre cannot hold"" Sometimes new balance is established after a great shift. Sometimes a system gets to a point where those living within its walls no longer wish to serve it, and collectively destroy it. For harmony to be had, balance is mandatory. The balance will always shift, and that ""center"" will be made up of the composition of its poles and spectrums, and the energy distributed among those spectrums. 

This is why my philosophy is to ""pendulate"" outlets and identity. It allows us to visit poles without total imbalance. It allows us the wisdom that is acquired through imbalances for a short period. There will always be outliers that spiral off into great imbalance in different directions. They're antithesis to one another and they bring balance overall. ""Balance through imbalance"". As I said I'm fascinated by imbalanced people, because they general have one way conjured to such a great length. The majority of people rest in much more balance, still imbalanced (to some degree [M/F for example]) states.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is demonstrably false. Automation has made every person vastly more productive

It has, but has also made many jobs obsolete so that the people that formerly worked them now enter the private government structure.

&gt; and large companies grow and die constantly and are replaced with people who had no ""factories"" or vast fortunes.

Large companies get acquired and merge with larger companies. Their workers are replaced in the name of streamlining, efficiency, and maximizing stock prices

&gt; Jeff Bezos just one of the latest examples in a line of hundreds of such people in the 20th century.  
&gt;

Jeff Bezos is an example of everything that is wrong with the underregulated private governments that Anderson is talking about. He answers to no one and there's no way to remove him no matter how negatively his decisions impact the vast majority of people at the bottom of the corporate ladder who will never have a taste of management or ownership.


&gt;The idea that people today are also less well-off or economically free than in the 19th century is also false. I don't know where you get this from. If you observe the level of material access of the bottom 10% of people in 2019 vs what it was in say 1929, it's like science-fiction levels of wealth.

We are less economically free in the sense that there's no recourse for workplace grievances. You speak out, you get fired. That's what ""right to work"" laws have done to a whole generation of employees. Did you even read the review?

I wrote a TLDR of Dialectic Materialism before that I will copy paste here, but honestly you may need to read Marx to get it from the source.   


A TLDR: Economic progression and class relationship based in availability of resources. Economies progress over time as technology evolves. We've gone through Subsistance - Artisan - Feudal - Mercantile - and now Capital economies. The last one defined by Industry and Private ownership of those industries.

As production begins to vastly outstrip needs the only way to maintain capital ownership and wage oppression is to create false scarcity or extract a large amount of the labor (wages vs profit) from the workers. This maintains the Class status quo - Workers vs capitalists.

Through automation and increasing efficiency there are less jobs and more unemployed struggling to feed and house themselves despite ready availability of resources. Eventually the system begins to break down. Examples here include huge increases in education/medical/housing/food costs and as the workers can no longer afford the products of their labor eventually they will have to fight back for survival.

This leads us to Socialism. The workers and lower classes struggle for survival, and if victorious and in taking the means of production can ensure that we control the creation of needs to match the population and requirements a society has.

Communism is the final evolution of the dialectic but IMO it's only achievable once a socialist state is able to eliminate scarcity. At that point the state is no longer necessary.

The Communist Manifesto is available at [Marxists.org](https://Marxists.org) and does a good job of explaining it.

I'm probably going to get some hate from the other lefties here, but NO country on the planet is ready for communism. Socialism is achievable at this point through automation - Close to 50% of jobs could be automated. Train the now-unemployed in the fields that can't be wholly automated. We all work less and produce more as a result.

We're talking about engaging the public with the logic of their preferences.. the Trolley problem can be introduced in all sorts of contexts involving consequentialist thinking.

That is the reason why established car manufacturers don't offer autopilots. There are no concrete laws regarding the safety right now, but there is the rule that systems have to be designed according to the state of the art. This means they have to apply ISO26262 or aquivalent measures. It will probably take a decade or more before level 4 automation (real self driving cars) is possible with regard to ISO26262. The thing is: development according to ISO26262 isn't checked when a new car is released, but when there are court proceedings. There are engineers and quality and marketing guys at very progressive car manufacturers right now, who might face long jail times in the future.

That being said, your assumption of a 'fail least dangerous' option is wrong (maybe it is how they behave right now but that's at least extremely dicey, but very probably illegal). In functional safety there are 'fail safe systems' and 'fail operational systems'. Most manufacturers treat autopilots as a fail operational system (even for level 3 automation for a short period of time, level 4 autopilots are clearly fail operational).

[],Jacques_Prairieda,,,[],,,,text,t2_3sjoxe28,False,,"I don't think the evidence backs up what you're saying about gender as a social construct. For one thing, gender *identity* was one of the most robust parallels in those twin studies you mentioned a post or two ago. So a study of your own choosing suggests natural/biological causes for deviations from socially assigned genders. Even putting that aside, there's simply far too much counter-evidence to believe in the idea that very much of our current understanding of gender is truly innate to people; consider the vast changes in gender norms across time and cultures, the number and variety of ""third gender"" concepts which have existed since antiquity in various cultures, and the long and well-documented history of gendernonconforming individuals and subcultures. The idea that modern Western notions of gender are somehow encoded in the human genome has a lot of empirical facts to explain away and basically no hard evidence with which to do it. The notion of ""male brains"" and ""female brains"" is as controversial empirically as it is ideologically, and social conditioning in general has been observed to have a measurable impact on behavior early enough that it's dubious to firmly assert ""nature"" over ""nurture"" even in marked differences in observed behavior along gender lines, even at very young ages. 

As for white privilege, I won't debate the arguments about feeling attacked, maligned, or villainous. If that's how you feel, it's how you feel and I don't think it's useful or productive to debate whether feelings are justified. I will, however, point out that, even if the motivation of most people who oppose black lives matter really isn't an actual feeling that black lives don't matter, it can still feel this way for the people protesting police violence, the same way those protests might feel ""villainizing"" to you even if that is not necessarily the speakers' intent. I know I feel like the majority of Americans don't think Indigenous/American Indian lives matter. If they did, the reservation where my family grew up would probably have clean drinking water and the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women would have received far more prevalent and serious media and law enforcement attention than it has. If people cared about our lives, they would care about the systemic discrimination we face and its literally lethal consequences, and I guess maybe they do or think they do, but their public-facing actions rarely seem to indicate that they do. If you feel as attacked as you are saying by the words and occasional street-blocking of recent protests against white privilege, think of how attacked we feel when it's been going on for centuries and the hurtful words are compounded by ubiquitous, organized neglect and abuse. If you are stressed by feeling like you have to struggle to convince people you aren't a racist person, imagine what it's like feeling like you have had to struggle your whole life to convince people you're a person *at all*. If you feel a need to stand up about how social justice protests have made you feel, can't you understand our need to stand up about the way the vast majority of mainstream culture has been making us feel for as long as we've been alive? 

On empirical questions, though, I think you're similarly misguided about the positive impact of social justice efforts. In the first place, because I think you're severely underestimating the impact of ""socially engineered"" success. Literally every black person in America is more successful because of efforts to fight white privilege than they would be without those efforts. Are you honestly trying to suggest that abolition, integration, and the Civil Rights act had no meaningful impact on the success of black Americans? All of those things were social engineering and all of them were directly concerned with fighting the manifestations and pejorative impacts of white privilege. 

Similarly, immigrants pose a threat to very few Americans' ability to make ends meet. If you look at the actual evidence, immigrants are net job creators on average and typically pay more into taxes than they receive from government programs. Male high-school dropouts are the only group whose employment rates are adversely impacted by either documented or undocumented immigration. Curtailing immigration would likely harm more Americans than it helps, and those few Americans it would help could be helped in far less costly and potentially harmful ways. Outsourcing, automation, and stagnant-or-worse inflation-adjusted wages in lower income brackets are the causes for the erasure of the middle class and the epidemic of underemployment, not immigration.

You could make a reasonable claim that animals are not conscious. They are organic automatons. Do animals have a ""will""?

When I mean about the genes I'm talking about the automaton unwilled part. Does that make sense?

&gt; What animals are inclined to care about is under selection pressure the same way everything else about them is, but evolution has only recently made a species that knows enough that it could even try maximize it's genes. We find animals want things that correlate with fitness because the ones that didn't are extinct.

And your evidence that evolution made man conscious is... what? In fact, there's a strong case to be made that man's ""will"", man's spirit, is NOT evolved because it is not physical.  The automated part of animals, including the automation of humans needs not be conscious in order to have the principle of maximized fitness, precisely because gearing towards that is what allows the survival. It is not perfect maximization, but it's the principle towards maximization. Now, I agree that man has consciousness and reason, and as such can work in favour or against that principle in ways automatons can't. They follow that principle without willing it, yet they are following it.

&gt; There are a lot of reasons why people cooperate. Family ties are one of these, but even that isn't about fitness maximizing.

This doesn't mean ""God could randomly change"" and no saying ""but that would contradict how God actually is"", would be the same as answering ""but it isn't"" to any other what if.

No, that's an incomprehension of what God is. If God were different He wouldn't be God. God could not logically be different because Logic is the foundational Order we have access to which enable us to grasp other minor orders(through logic, a.k.a reason, we can grasp the natural sciences, for example) and that comes from Him. If God were different, Logic would be different. Saying a what if God were different does not make sense in the sense that there is no direction for God to go or not go that is not self-contained within His Nature. God Is, but He Is because he Wills himself to be so. This is hard to grasp because we are contingent beings that HAVE to follow an order. He IS the Order every other order, even unethical orders are founded upon.

 &gt;More generally is the being in charge cared about reducing suffering, increasing agency, happiness in varied forms, equity, fairness of outcome, group loyalty, ect, we'd have a different world.

Yes, of course. God is not in ""charge"" of the world, if that's what you're aiming for. Our cosmos, which is ordered, is built upon God, which is the ultimate Order from which every other order arises. Yet we are in charge of our region of the cosmos. This planet is in our ""charge"", and all the evil or disorder that comes from it, yes, it is within the greater Order, but it is temporarily non-aligned with that order because we are sovereign in this piece of our order as far as our will allows it to be. We make of this world what we collectively will. If it's chaotic it's because WE are being chaotic, not because God is chaotic.

Entropy does not arises complexity, and even then, the principle I'm describing is the direction of the complexity by the unifying principle I call Love.

This is why I assert bodily autonomy.

Since anarchism is defined as ""against rulers,"" and since Capitalism has the same hierarchical structures of rulers, but decentralized, I don't believe an ""Anarcho-capitalist"" system can work.

After doing a lot of math I don't know that there is a good answer. I like the idea of CEO not making more than around 100x what their lowest employees make, but for an enormous company like Amazon or Walmart these figures don't make a lot of sense. Pay Bezos 6m and the janitors 60k? That seems fair to the janitors but unfair to Bezos. However, if you throw in stock options then we're back to the ridiculous disparity that exists now.   


How do you handle stock option adjustment though? He built the company from the ground up. Doesn't he deserve the fruits of that labor? Yes and No. He deserves to reap the benefits of his skilled leadership but that's included unfair wages for decades. He has not appropriately compensated the other people that built the company. The Stockers, the Customer Service department, the Warehouse Managers, the Programmers. He has retained more shares of the company than I believe he should have, shares that should have went to the employees if he was going to continue to pay them, compared to the performance of the company, low wages.  


Nothing can be done about his disproportionate compensation now. If we're going to regulate ownership of a company to being partly employee based with shares(uh-oh comrade), then it has to be done in the early stages. I wouldn't advocate taking his shares away now. His concern from the beginning was retaining board control, which surely effected his willingness to provide shares. In which case, under a regulated economy requiring shares as compensation, he could have introduced a stock buyback program to ensure that he always held majority.  


I think the other problem in this argument is that companies like Amazon or Walmart simply have too many employees for adequate regulation. 566k / 1.5m employees. Google employs 72k. A 100x pay-rate regulation might make sense at Google, but not at Amazon or Walmart. It could be fixed to the number of employees to provide a more realistic number, but then we're still left with the issues of stock compensation.  


I don't think any of the regulation I've mentioned is feasible anyway. Even if you could get conservatives to agree with them or something similar (you couldn't), companies would likely relocate their entire workforce to another country rather than face the monetary shift of company profits going to their employees rather than their CEO and Board. I also don't think that the regulations here would be reasonable in our current economy.

If our world was open source, imagine how many different perspectives and unique ideas and inventions could be created by people who wish to see a better world. 

With automation on the rise, the future ‘economy’ will be structured upon creativity and ideas. We can use these tools to our advantage already, if we ever choose to do so.

It is not irrational tribalism to point the finger at the system and their benefactors for it. Being criticized for being a billionaire is far removed from being criticized for your skin color, or religion.

I don't think even the wealthy 0.01% are necessarily bad people, but many, as I do, do point out certain specific individuals out of that, which does not extrapolate to the whole, even if I still think the gap of the inequality still is bad.

&gt;But if we were to look at a communist country like North Korea i thinks its pretty clear that the chances of someone worshiping Kim Jong Un are far greater than the opposite.

If we have to go to North Korea to get an example of a trait you say ""the left shares just like the right"" I feel like we lost all honesty in the conversation. Thats because outside of that, even in Soviet Russia, or Cuba, or Cambodia, the tankies never thought their leaders were literally religious figures, or prophets, etc. The ""cult"" in the cult of Stalin is just a way of saying they took authoritarianism and ""follow the leader"" to a whole different level, comparing it to religions. It is never to imply actual superstition and belief that Stalin was son of God or anything.

&gt;The Soviet Union was a far left authoritarian state, and to suggest anything else is just being willfully dishonest.

I do think it was a far left authoritarian state, but I'll admit I was being smug here. Still, I don't think Soviet Union and it's derivatives are a good example of the things defended by the academic left, which is the point here. Most are talking about capitalism reform under democracy, welfare state, writing about automation, etc.

&gt;My original point is that simplistic descriptions of any political movement/s, in this case the right wing ones, as tribalistic, bigoted, hierarchical and ridiculous is insane because through history and the present we can observe the same negative attributes within political parties and nations on the left.

Being generic about something isn't necessarily a bad thing. If a group is clearly more let's say, xenophobic, or anti-science than the other, and I make a generic statement about it (like my original post), it is dishonest to go ""hey, look at North Korea"" to imply that the two groups are kind of the same. 

In most of the world, the things I cited (hierarchies, tribalism, religion, bigotry, and traditions) are things that if you find someone defending it, it will overwhelmingly generally be defended by a conservative, and it is not controversial to say that. Human sciences in general, with philosophers and universities, were generally far ahead of their time, in regards to slavery, religion, law, etc., and that progressive trait came from open mindedness and not taking current ideas from granted. This happens for thousands of years in universities, loooong before Marx and others even existed, it is not a ""new thing"", people coming out of universities more progressive it is not a leftist takeover.

1.  From my experience those sales managers get a bonus for sales productivity. What about the person who made the product that was sold? The people who collected and refined the materials? They, to me, have way more importance in the cycle and have the most to benefit. I don’t agree with any single entity owning any resource as it creates an immediate divide within public trust and interest. 

2. Crazy easier. That ease comes with it the price of inaccurately qualifying human effort into mentally values. We can actually measure a persons life in dollars at this point and that says more about what we value and how we treat each other than what we would like I think. A an open access necessity resource base economy with a focus on ecological needs and interaction would fit best for our current world situation and future development. Especially when automation hits stride and most of the harder jobs no longer need human muscle. For those that can afford the technology, which makes no sense. We barter from ourselves rather than with each other and that’s the evolution or at least could be that we use his system so we can find a better one not go all in for eternity. I can go into how when you have a bunch of money and production you influence humanity and if it’s for the sake of profits you lose a lot in the process. 

3. It’s true. They just operate around the parameters someone else gave you for your god given rights. To me it sounds just as silly. If you had to be told what your rights are and cannot discern the difference between what, actually, benefits a greater whole of people and what takes advantage and abuses them maybe you need that type of controls and domination with the threat of violence to operate. To me it’s a lot like religion if you need to subscribe to someone else’s story of how things exist and how to act and what it all means that’s great. To me these laws and concepts exist as tools to break down reality and allow us to function. When you can make or find a better tool it may stand that the old tools will not serve us and continued use may hinder us individually and collectively. We usually don’t use the same tools we had as children o would like to see the same progression in myself and others in general. That takes a change of mindset as a whole and setting or environment. If there was a focus on mutual benefit, human and rest of earth, and more fair compensation that could lead to a new direction of both in my opinion. “Free” healthcare and education could be a good start. 

4. I may have anarchy like tendencies while at the same time nothing needs to be destroyed. Only the same efforts reallocated. Changing the economy will impact almost everyone. Resisting that change comes from the top down as those who have effectively created the current forms of economy do so through aggression in some way and ultimately legal violence. If you take away their ability or authority to control and dominate, which was taken by legal means and in no way a choice by a community or people’s, ( I don’t count being born in proximity or being told”this is the way we do thing or this is how it works” as consent, which is one way of doing things and it can always work better) then you find yourself in a new situation and doing so without proper preparation does seem incredibly disastrous. That’s why you set yourself up for the change as the exchange of power and authority in a manner that both sticks to the core principle behind the necessity of change and the values that the new system will uphold. I do not see this in the current scheme of events and movements within the economy and it’s history. Nowhere have I seen an end game that considers a next step or evolution and instead a doubling down on the same policies and tools we use as children. Acting like children gets us nowhere, having a child’s wonderment and enthusiasm for discovery keeps us fresh and makes sense considering we live maybe 100 years and that’s a short time for us to think ourselves so important we would not have greater consideration. 

5. I support large where it has the most beneficial use and small in the same regard. Adding an outside authority for the sake of having it seems more of a hinderance and not understanding and denying how we operate and function as a whole organism both on the planet and within our species creates a disconnection from that which gives us life. So like I was getting at before, creating a base mindset and environment would be key to understanding the use of the micro and macro. Exploring what we impact when we make legal and illegal and who or what it benefits and why. When I’m told “that’s how it works” as way to close off discussion I ask how it actually works and I often get a lot of information about policy and money which is the over simplified ,easy yes, and a lazy way of understanding. We need a way to be able to independently make choices and at the same time interact on the same level. I think we do a pretty good job if only we didn’t change the rules every 4 to 8 years. Especially how they change in a swing motion. That breeds corruption and limits damage control. I believe the focus and application of the government needs a change and that starts with the mentality of those elected.

I don’t think that’s necessarily true, and it’s important to understand that the level of organization that’s being advocated for by people like Chomsky would almost definitely be much more simplistic and regional than that of something like the United States, New York State, or even Binghamton. If power becomes something that’s truly locally concentrated, it becomes a lot more difficult to abuse, and this is part of the appeal of direct democracy, though it obviously becomes a contradiction in terms when you’re trying to organize a direct democracy between 300 million people, so the form of political organization being advocated for by anarcho-syndicalists would almost certainly necessitate serious restructuring of...many things. I haven’t actually read as deeply as I’d like to on this subject, but it’s my understanding that whatever forms of organization might emerge here, they wouldn’t be as permanently fixed as the state bureaucracies we currently have, as they would be local and so occupations wouldn’t necessarily be as fixed as they currently are. This does kind of sound like a pipe dream but I think that with the ongoing emergence of AI and the increasing automation of rote tasks, this is becoming increasingly feasible at a technical level. 

But reorganizing administrative power in this sense would entail basically dismantling nation states entirely from the inside out, and this isn’t going to happen for obvious reasons. Things would have to be fundamentally restructured to prevent power from again becoming excessively consolidated, and I really can’t imagine someone like Mitch McConnell signing off on that. 

As for what makes authority unjust, that’s a pretty big question. But the anarchist would consider especially that derived economically (i.e. private ownership) to be unjust, and frankly I agree.

...where this falls apart is when the person does not unambiguously communicate that they want to stop and argue ""they should have known I felt uncomfortable"". I think at the heart of some of these issues we are vilifying people who are themselves also the victim of someone else's anxiety or manipulation. A sadly common scenario for young people.

Full up, if you unambiguously initiate or agree to sex then decide ""ehh, maybe I shouldn't have done this"" in the middle and 1. Say nothing. 2. Make no change in body language, or 3. 'Fake it'  ... How could the other person ever know? Sure, there is now emotional damage to the receiver. Sure, that's bad. But is the 'giver' really guilty of any wrong? In my opinion, absolutely not. Men and women are often guilty of 'playing the part' in sex instead of being honest that they're not really feeling it. Often they do so as a gift to their partner and intentionally deceive them into sex they don't want. Laws of affirmative consent are extremely difficult to reconcile against the complexities of human social and sexual behaviour.

Sometimes people are hurt and there isn't another person you can blame for it. In fact, sometimes you're hurt and it's your own fault. I think this murky scenario defines all too many college-age sexual assault cases where one part is guilty - or even both parties are equally guilty - of poor communication, anxiousness and 'playing the part' instead of communicating unambiguously.

It's not that physics is not important. But if your view was right - or shared by decision makers - then sociology departments would not exist. But that's not the case. So there needs to be decisions to be made how much research money to allocate to sociologists, philosophers, and physicists. Yeah, that is not related to the ""objecticity"" of physics, but it's related to what we *learn* about. 

&gt; The point of physics,biology,chemistry,maths is to give us an objective view of the world basen on evidence. scientific research is contacted in a way so the results are not affected by the beliefs of the scientists that run the research.

You don't need to tell me that, but science may have that goal and still have subjective points in it. (Not sure what that^s even supposed to mean). I really recommend you read this article, it's a classic and outlines the potential problems in biology very well 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/4320377?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

For chemistry, I recommend this: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cmdc.201500091 which is a great study into how industry chemists decide which molecules to look into in order to figure out whether they may help in future medication. That's a peculiar problem - because there's no way to know which ones will work out and you need tons of money to look into specific molecules with no guarantee anything comes out of it. What is of interest here is the very subjective argumentation the chemists use to convince their department head that their molecule deserves more funding. 

For physics, I mean I'll gladly grant that it's much less ""subjective"". I don't want to say that we shouldn't be reasonably certain of the outcomes. Not at all. What I'm saying is that your statement that science is completely subjectivity free is wrong.  (And then again,  Quantum Mechanics interpretations are probably not testable , making it a matter of taste rather than empirical testing. To be fair tho, many physisicts don't subscribe to either interpretation)

To deny this is to implausibly maintain that the seriousness of a wrong does not depend on the victim's attitudes toward the encounter, the victim's experience during the encounter, and the effects that the encounter has on the victim.  
[...]  
&gt; we would hope that no one we cared about acted in this way, or was in the position of A and C, for that matter. When we consider what is awry with each agent's conduct, the natural candidate is that the agent has proceeded without ascertaining that their partner is willing to have sex.

These are mutually exclusive stances.  If EF is a more serious wrong (and I'm not implying it isn't) based on the effects on the *victim* rather than the actions of the perpetrator, than AB and CD are *necessarily* entirely kosher for the exact same reason.  A, B, C, D... and unfortunately F... all got exactly what they wanted when presented with the exact same conditions.

The real problem here is with a subtle word choice the author makes - ""agent"".  As presented, from the perspective of ""agents"" B/D/F, all three scenarios are identical.  But all three scenarios are **not** identical, because A/C/E are all capable of agency as well.  The key difference between them, then, is that of the six people, only *one* of them has intentionally withheld information that would have changed the outcome - And that one is E.

Just to be clear, I'm not ""blaming"" the victim here; I'm pointing out the problem with using those three scenarios as presented.  And, as presented, A/C/E have more control over (ie, more information about) the situation than do B/D/F, yet choose not to exercise that control.

I'll admit I don't know how much it would cost to regulate the system, but at the same time it's still going to be incredibly expensive to set the system up in the first place. I don't know exactly what would need to be done to ensure UBI would work besides major slashing of current financial programs, but I really can't imagine that overhead would cost enough to break it once the system is in place financially since it's still going to need maintenance regardless. Sounds almost like pennies on the dollar to me but I could very well be wrong.

While current poverty social programs worked in the past. UBI will certainly be more expensive to start no matter what, but theoretically when rolled into one program, it'll be much more streamlined, effective, cost efficient, and essential for the coming age as automation takes low skill jobs away and we find more and more unemployed citizens. ultimately the main concern is that the higher tax rates from UBI will end up with people not wanting to work, but there is no way UBI will be able to ensure a fulfilled lifestyle for most people, meaning people are still going to search out employment so they can sustain more than basic living necessities, even if their work pay gets taxed more, knowing you have that safety net, and having more freedom as the employee to decide who, where, what, and how you want to work since it's not your ""livelyhood"", but your ""fun"" on the line sounds like a win in my book for the people.

Digressions aside, the main goal of overhead regulation is to help curb homelessness. Welfare does that to an extent, but not nearly well enough.

You're probably MUCH more well versed than me:

&gt;Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is based on earned work credits. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a means-tested program. You can collect both SSDI and $1,000 a month. Most people who are legally disabled receive both SSDI and SSI. Under the universal basic income, those who are legally disabled would have a choice between collecting SSDI and the $1,000, or collecting SSDI and SSI, whichever is more generous.

&gt;Even some people who receive more than $1,000 a month in SSI would choose to take the Freedom Dividend because it has no preconditions. Basic income removes these requirements and guarantees an income, regardless of other factors.""

My boss and I went to a huge house in a very upmarket part of town to do some maintenance on all the audio-visual/home automation components in the house and when we got there we were greeted by the owner, who I guess was around 50 years old, and his very eccentric looking wife. I'm talking blue hair, one pink eyebrow, the other green and psychedelic trance inducing clothing. My boss however new what to expect since he has been there before, but I was completely caught off guard by the sheer sight of this woman. 

After all the necessary pleasantries my boss and I walk back to the car to get our tools and my boss just say ""you haven't seen anything yet.""

That obviously peaked my interest but I couldn't see anything else out of the ordinary in the house except for the psychedelic looking middle aged woman, so I started doing my job. After about half an hour the owners told us that they are quickly going out and will be back shortly. They barely left when my boss called me over and said ""come check this shit!""

He opened the main bedroom door and pushed me in. The room was dimly lit, but when my eyes adjusted to the light I saw that all the walls were covered with thick maroon coloured velvet curtains, the ceiling covered with maroon suede and the floor was entirely black shag carpet. In the middle of the room there was a massive round love bed, which was on some sort of pedestal/plinth with steps up to the bed, and directly above the bed there was an even bigger round mirror on the ceiling. 

I stood there half perplexed and half flabbergasted by what my eyes just took in. My boss is laughing his arse off just looking at my expression and he goes ""that's not all!""

How was that not all? I'm standing in some type of love nest that normally only exist in the minds of adolescent male horndogs and my boss is telling me that there is more! Just how???

I suddenly had to brace myself as my boss started opening all the curtains covering the walls and my jaw dropped! 

I was suddenly looking at the most incredible roman style fresco mural that I have ever seen! Every square inch of the walls were painted with every sex act imaginable! Everything from straight sex to beastiality in some sort of forest setting.

There was men fucking women over boulders, women eating each other out against tree trunks,  wolves fucking women in ditches, men fucking pigs and everything in between! It was the biggest depiction of an ""anything goes"" orgy that I have ever seen.  And yet it was so tastefully done that even Julius Caesar would have been proud. 

I only later realised that the candle holders was marble carvings of men and women having sex and the bedside tables were brass figures of women on their backs being fucked by wolves and holding the glass top up with their hands and feet. 

It was both the most incredible and terrible place I have ever been. Also, I didn't go anywhere near that bed!

2. Even greater social isolation as young folks more aggressively curate their social circles.

I would start with a set of telerobot designs based on parts repurposed from RC model excavators (the basic tracked turntable excavator chassis in 1:15 - 1:8 suiting many robot uses and with milled alloy having enough mass for actual excavation and construction at small scales) under local PC-based RC control with simple first-person video which would be used to demonstrate surface outpost development culminating in mound-formed shell habitat construction on a mock-up lunar setting. 

Then I would go for a larger repeat demonstration and a second generation Internet linked control system with a web-based open source Telebase Management Platform supporting multi-user activity, different virtual workstation configurations, and script-based automation. 

Eventually I would go for suspended space frame rigs simulating orbital/microgravity settings and develop a dynamically gangable modular multipurpose mobile arm telerobot (an 'inchworm' robot) that would later be used for a minimalist android 'torso' supporting VR interface setups. These would be used to demonstrate the 'EvoHav' habitat concept where a yurt-like modular construction system is used for perpetually maintainable and expandable orbital habitats.

Well, I can't go into specific details for obvious reasons, but you're partially right. Reason being that yes, several companies cheap-out in cyber-security measures to keep Engineering Stations and other computers safe from the dangers of the internet, the logical controllers themselves however do not have access to the internet nor the software / protocols installed to make any use of said connection.

Standard way it connects is: field devices &gt; remote IOs &gt; comm bus &gt; comm bus &gt; PLC &gt; Engineering Station / PG, where PGs usually work isolated from any other networks beside the Automation Software network, and Eng. Stations MAY be connected to the internet.

So **TECHNICALLY** breachs can happen (and have happened) at the level of Engineering Station, which can then connect to the PLC and from where disasters may happen, so most companies just basically disable all connections from the Engineering Stations to outside networks (by means of not having it connected in the first place), in order to not invest into further security measures.

Certain other facilities require external monitoring services, which require limited access to the internet. The way this is **properly** done is through other external reporting systems which communicate through limited access on the HMI, and thus do not exert actual control on the PLC. Other facilities do require to actually execute control remotely, and there we enter danger zone, in which the actual safety of the facility will depend on how good of a ""defense system"" these guys put in place (firewalls, what-have-you), but this now escapes my expertise and won't be able to provide much more detail.",1569428252,{},f1eqtw0,False,t3_d91j1e,False,True,t1_f1epg26,/r/AskReddit/comments/d91j1e/noncashiers_of_reddit_whats_the_it_didnt_scan_so/f1eqtw0/,1569428254.0,1,True,[],False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Societies with immense wealth and immense inequality of that wealth can use communism the best, as they have more resources tied up in supporting fewer citizens than the quasi-feudal system which still existed in Russia at that time. They'd started sending serfs to the factories and mines, but they were by no means an industrial economy. Even Lenin knew this, and much of his writing is trying to justify the establishment of Communism in a preindustrial economy.

As to your comments on cannibalization...that's kinda the whole point. Marx recognized that the elites had built the machines in the first place, but he saw no reason for those elites to get rich and fat off the sweat of everyone else. He was saying that, in heavily industrial economies, the elites make themselfs obsolete, and that the workers could therefore eliminate them and distribute those resources more equitably.

I admit he was wrong about this. You need much more than just factories to create that society, just because of human laziness. What you need is the ability to remove humans from the supply chain altogether.

And that is what is happening. The most obvious place is self-driving vehicles. They already exist. They are already demonstrably safer than human drivers under most conditions, exception for snowed-over roads where traffic lines and signals are totally occluded. Which never even happens in most of the United States. The only reasons they haven't taken over yet are price and legislation. As soon as the price drops low enough and insurance companies have reliable actuarial data on them, human drivers will be obsolete just because of insurance cost. A self-driving vehicle is the perfect customer for insurance companies, after all. It pays a small price every month and never gets in an accident. Legislation will be easy to solve because insurance companies can lean pretty hard on legislators.

Once all of that happens, and it will, every single person whose job is moving people or things from A to B is out of a job. Not just unemployed either, but unemployable. Semi drivers, taxis, Uber and Lyft, courriers, everyone whose job is transportation will have a completely worthless set of skills. In some states, that's 15% of all employment. You can't employ that many people in fixing the new vehicles either, what's the current ratio of mechanics to drivers? They'll all have to find totally new jobs (how, given that none of this is expanding other fields of employment), or the government will have to support them at the level they are used to, or you get a class war as former drivers begin to starve and realize they have nothing to lose but their chains.

In reality they were scared of losing their jobs.  The same thing is happening right now with UBI, and people's fear of the future.  Look at who is lobbying the fear of no jobs. They are short sighted IMO, and do not realize that this is nothing new. 

There will always be jobs.  They just might not be what you have traditionally done or you may have to retrain for another I dustry. 

The U. S. manufacturing jobs have mostly been replaced by service related jobs. Just like manufacturing replaced farming jobs 100 years ago.  What will replace service jobs? I have no idea... But living out of fear that the future is bleak is a defeatist attitude and victim mentality. Overcoming that in my opinion is the first step towards moving to a better financial position.  Each individual is in charge of their own destiny.  The capitalist model is arguably the best vehicle for people to realize this success.

No, we don't as resource scarcity exists in a very meaningful way.  Additionally while automation has come quite far its not to the point of eliminating the human factor in manufacturing and management.

In order to reach this point the robots need to be able to fix the robots AND be able to resupply themselves with parts without any human intervention.  We are a quite a long ways from this, 100 years at a guess.  What we have effectivly done is greatly reduced the number of people to say make a car, and as the years go on that number will reduce further, but it is still quite a large number of people required for the process.

All this however does not fix the resource scarcity problem.  You can only mine so much copper so fast, and you have to find it to boot, which is still somewhat of a guessing game.  Then you have to be able to get to it once you have found it, ect ect.  To fix resource scarcity we would need population growth to level off and will likely need access to space based resources (asteroid mining basically).  This is likely 100-200 years off still (sadly), this one is more uncertain though, it would take relatively few major breakthroughs space wise in order to set off a rapid industrialization of space.  However once you get those breakthroughs this might induce rapid population growth as we may have more area to expand to.

https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1964/jun/19/automation

Here's the relevant part:

&gt; Let me try to convey to the House one of the consequences of not providing this kind of education for the kind of children about whom we are talking. I want to quote an expert whose name is famous not only here, but throughout the world. He is perhaps almost the most celebrated living Englishman. His name is John Lennon and he is one of the Beatles. I have never seen or heard the Beatles, but I have been very interested indeed to read a book by John Lennon, published in America and, I believe, in this country. It is called ""In His Own Write"".

&gt; The book contains a number of poems and fairy stories written by Lennon. These tell a great deal about the education he received in Liverpool. He explains that he was born there in 1940 and attended various schools, where he could not pass examinations. I would like to quote one of the poems. It is one that the Ministry of Education and Science might well distribute to every member of its staff concerned with the kind of children we are discussing. It is called ""Deaf Ted, Danoota and Me"". I will quote three verses from it: 

&gt; &gt; Never shall we partly stray,  
&gt; &gt; Fast stirrup all we three  
&gt; &gt; Fight the battle mighty sword  
&gt; &gt; Deaf Ted, Danoota, and me.  

&gt; &gt; Thorg Billy grows and Burnley ten,  
&gt; &gt; And Aston Villa three  
&gt; &gt; We clobber ever gallup  
&gt; &gt; Deaf Ted, Danoota, and me.  

&gt; &gt; So if you hear a wondrous sight,  
&gt; &gt; Am blutter or at sea,  
&gt; &gt; Remember whom the mighty say  
&gt; &gt; Deaf Ted, Danoota, and me.'  

&gt; I quote that poem not because of its literary merit, but because one can see from it, as from other poems and stories in the book, two things about John Lennon: he has a feeling for words and story telling and he is in a state of pathetic near-literacy. He seems to have picked up bits of Tennyson, Browning and Robert Louis Stevenson while listening with one ear to the football results on the wireless.

&gt; The book suggests to me a boy who, on the evidence of these writings, should have been given an education which would have enabled him to develop the literary talent that he appears to have. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State can tell us anything about what kind of school this Beatle went to. The volume from which I have quoted strikes me as singularly pathetic and touching.

&gt; The boy appears to be a sort of throwback to H. G. Wells's ""Mr. Polly"", who was brought up in much the same fashion and who was also a boy with a love for and ability with words which he was unable to get developed in school so that, when he was grown up, he talked about ""Sesquipedarian verbijooce."" ""Mr. Polly"" went to school nearly 100 years ago, but it seems that the kind of education that made him talk like that was still being supplied in Liverpool when John Lennon was at school in the 1950s. I would like my hon. Friend to tell us what the secondary modern schools of Liverpool are like now. What sort of education is being provided for that sort of boy at present?",1567675993,{},ez3vrqy,False,t3_czxr2x,False,True,t3_czxr2x,/r/todayilearned/comments/czxr2x/til_a_john_lennon_poem_was_read_out_in_parliament/ez3vrqy/,1567676110.0,1,True,[],False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This one'll get fixed and at some point you'll have no option but to board a max (or its rebranded successor that may or may not be the same plane) or take a car instead on certain routes.

If you're willing to further discuss the issue I recommend you go and check [this exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/cqvvg6/a_westjet_737_max_8_seems_sad_about_its_long/ex2i8ya) in which, minus the personal back and forth, we managed to kinda agree on it with someone who claims to work at airbus.

The Max 8 has a software issue that presented on only 2 planes in which both had similar failures going on (both reports include AoA sensors going ham and dubious maintenance records). Those failures are clear at pointing at multiple points in the software alone. Automation and pilot input pretty much live together in most modern aircraft flying nowadays in a way or another, the thing is the max has serious issues on where the automation takes info from (bad sensors) and how much does it leave out to the pilot (MCAS being obscure, hard to cut off, and in the last crash didn't even listen to the cutoff order apparently). 

The media however has put the focus on the airframe itself because the design dates from the 60s, which has absolutely nothing to do with the real issue: 21st century corruption. The entire 737 family is made up of very solid designs, that's why it's the world most popular airliner. Adding bigger engines causing a tendency to nose up should be absolutely trivial to solve, but Boeing was trying to cut corners and the people supposed to check that didn't do their jobs either.

The Max 8 is not haunted, it is not dangerous under normal working conditions, it's not ""an outdated design pushed over its limits"", it's just controlled by software that was rushed together and incorrectly checked yet somehow certified, and that is what's dangerous. If you fall for the bullshit that is focusing on the design of the airframe, you'll have absolutely nothing to say the next time this happens, when some other manufacturer or even boeing themselves again go for the cheap route and skip certifications and ship faulty software in their aircraft, left hidden from pilot control and knowledge.

At any rate, I'll quote myself here:

&gt; the two MAX 8 that crashed should not overshadow those \[130\] that were flying just fine, one of the things the media conveniently left aside on most cases.    
&gt;  
&gt;\[Boeing\] haven't managed to fix the issue \[yet\] because unlike some obscure repo on github they can't just push an update, and they also can't instantly deploy to all aircraft.  
&gt;  
&gt;They've done at least 2 or 3 test flights (with verifiable stall testing as well, thanks spotters and trackers) and now they need to actually make sure the thing is fixed, re-certify the entire instrumental and software (under scrutiny orders of magnitude more strict now) and rebuild the instrumental, one unit per plane built, and install those plane per plane with a fixed gaze looking over them.  
&gt;  
&gt;They've also gone and found more problems, so it's not just rewriting software to tune PIDs either. They need to see why their AoA sensors are failing so much, upgrade all the units to make those readings visible instead of optional (IIRC), and again, re deploy all the sensors (2 per plane, amounting to 600 physical replacements) and do unit and integration tests on everything.",1566300629,{},exhc3ly,False,t3_cr2y60,False,True,t1_exh9si1,/r/todayilearned/comments/cr2y60/til_that_the_boeing_737max_was_fitted_with_a/exhc3ly/,1566300630.0,1,True,,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],phiwong,,,[],,,,text,t2_f9mqn,False,,"This is probably a very hard ELI5 question.

There is some idea that a different type of system is needed to distribute welfare to the citizens of a country. This is likely a combination of more advanced technology leading to lower cost for basic necessities (ie it could be ""affordable"" for governments) and changing economic returns (too much wealth concentrated to too few, ""winner takes all"" situations, automation is coming ""too fast"") So there are ideas that have a lot of thought put into it with some credible arguments that something along the lines of a ""basic income"" should be guaranteed to all peoples.

In theory, the government has the ability to do this since it can almost literally ""print money"" if it chooses. However there are good reasons why governments choose not to liberally print money. There is concern that a ""basic income"" reduces incentive to work, will be highly inflationary (ie not stable/sustainable) leading to a lot of disruption in a complex economy.

No matter how well thought out, the idea of a ""guaranteed basic income"" has never been tried at the scale of a large and complex economy like the US. This almost certainly guarantees some kind of unintended consequence - which may be good or bad. For example: it could allow people time to get more education/retraining leading to a fantastically educated and productive workforce in the future. Or there may be too many people dropping out of the labor force quickly especially those who were close to retirement anyway but are still very productive/competent. These things can be ""thought of"" but no one can accurately predict what actually happens. 

To some people, the current situation is bad enough that some action is worth the risk. To others, the risk of bad outcomes far outweighs any potential good that might occur.

[],DarkAlman,,,[],,,,text,t2_99y1x,False,,"'Freedom Dividend' is a marketing term for what is more commonly referred to as Universal Basic Income or UBI.

UBI challenges one of the fundamental rules of society ""you have to work to survive"". We have arguably reached a point know as a post-scarcity society where we produce enough resources to meet the basic needs of everyone in our society.

As automation increases, the amount of work available for people is reduced. This results in a handful of people having a huge amount of wealth, and increasing population of people who are effectively unemployable.

To solve this problem we can either ban automation, force companies to hire people to perform menial tasks at minimum wage levels, or accept the fact that the 40 hour work week is becoming obsolete.

The basic idea of UBI is that everyone in society should be paid or start with a flat income that covers the basic necessities of life such as Food, Water, Shelter, Healthcare, and Education. If a person can contribute the society by working they in turn get more than the bare minimum.

UBI potentially solves a lot of problems. For instance people who can't get higher educations now are free to become more educated because the barriers to getting an education (cost of education and living) are removed.

But implementing such a system faces a lot of hurdles, particularly because of the stigma attached to similar concepts like welfare and disability.

This effectively replaces concepts that we've had for a long time such as disability and welfare (because now everyone has the same base level)

&gt; Like for example, couldn't landlord mark up housing by $500 a month and you would still have the same amount of money in terms of spending power? 

The technical term for this is inflation, and yes that will happen to a degree. The same argument is used to counter raising the minimum wage. As you increase payments to people the cost of living will increase, but it's the cost of living increase that caused the need to increase payments in the first place.

Historically speaking raising the minimum wage has caused inflation, but not nearly to the degree that the doom and gloom predictions would make out. The key is to not increase it drastically over night. Unfortunately the minimum wage has not kept up with inflation over the passed several decades and is now at crisis point in many areas in the US.

&gt; Also, since it's said that these big companies have paid zero in taxes, how can we sort of force them to do it?

[],bremidon,,,[],,,,text,t2_kr5od,False,,"A little of both, but not quite like you might be thinking.

The discoveries are happening all the time.  Someone, somewhere has a bright idea, tries it out, and it works.  This is just the start of the journey (and we are ignoring all the times it does not even work at this early point).

Now that the general idea is proven, you need to find a way to produce it in an affordable way.  This can be pretty tricky.  You might end up needing to develop a string of yet more technologies just to produce that first one that was your goal.  You might need to adapt production techniques.  You might need more basic science.  

Once your lab rats have figured out how to produce the original idea in an affordable way, the whole thing goes into a pilot phase where everything is scaled up.  Many times, the ideas that worked well in small-scale production don't work well when you try to do it in any big numbers.  This can be very dangerous.  My father did this pilot-phase stuff for a living and has many near-miss stories where things turned exciting for a few moments.

So now you've got the pilot-scale production down and it's time to go to full-scale production.  This is where the final big investment is made.  This is the point when not only the manufacturing costs skyrocket, but you start needing sales and marketing investment that can easily rival those manufacturing costs.

Now, during all this time, your guys at all levels have been coming up with even better ideas and optimizations.  If we move this bit here, we can save 5% on material.  If we move that bit there, we can be 3% faster.  And so on.  

This is where the ""control the rate"" comes into play.  You have to make a decision: go with the design you have and commit, or wait a few months until the improvements can worm their way through all the development phases.  When do you pull the trigger and go to market?  Go too early, and someone else might bring out a product a month later that the market prefers.  Go too late, and someone else might eat up all the market before you can even deliver the first product.  This can be a billion dollar decision.  If you time it right, congrats: you are in the next issue of Forbes.  If you time it wrong: oops, you are also in the next issue of Forbes.  

So this is why things keep improving; the entire process has a momentum that is continually bringing out new things.  This particular industry has a direct self-referential loop as well.  Every time something new does make it to market, all those guys at the beginning of the process have even better tools to come up with even better ideas.  By the time those new ideas work their way through the whole process, yet another generation of better tools has found their way into the researchers' hands, keeping the whole thing in motion.

The main bottleneck is simply the length of time that it takes to move an idea all the way up to a mass-production concept.  So far, only humans could really guide and control the process.  The on-going AI revolution threatens/promises to change everything and compress time.  If this does, in fact, happen, then we will see a new phase of automation kick in where the whole ""new idea--&gt;pilot--&gt;production--&gt;new tools--&gt;new idea"" circle starts looking more and more like a point.

* Everybody has internet and users are comfortable using online services now.
* GPS is common in phones. This means deliverers can be tracked very cheaply and effectively through the software.
* The biggest concentration is in highly populated urban areas where people have increasingly smaller kitchens and are time poor.
* Economies of scale - they build a single framework, a system, and just apply that across a whole bunch of restaurants in a region, and then expand to more regions. Most of the local work is going to be in legal and promotion at this point, with occasional changes to the core system to support things like regional legal or tax quirks. Any call center or online services can be shared between regions and/or outsourced. You can trial things in one region and then roll out to others. All software can be developed centrally.
* The software is the main asset and there are fewer actual employees. The company itself is light, and essentially outsources almost all the actual work performed to the individual deliverers. They are also outsourcing much of the risk and effort of finding the right balance, distribution, and scheduling of those contractors. It's a market system.
* Also outsourced to a kind of market is the risk associated with staffing, stock purchasing and so on of the restaurants. If one has too many staff and too much stock to sell, that is the restaurants problem.
* All that said, these system can provide opportunities to find efficiencies. For example, they may be able to send requests to delivery people taking into account various factors (location, vehicle, traffic, other nearby drivers, expected orders based on history) to make them more efficient. They can measure the effects of these changes.

&amp;#x200B;

Those are some other factors. Clearly the biggest thing is that people are available to work for such small remuneration. I think this is a factor of the wider job situation and the increasing casualisation and contractorisation of the workforce. Lots of these people are probably already working 1 or 2 other jobs already.

Automation and their use by corporation improved the lives of people dramatically by giving them less work and more wealth.

[],xix_xeaon,,,[],,,,text,t2_3msk4,False,,"The answers in this thread are wild! I especially like the ones who are correct, but with totally wrong explanations =P

Things are finite, so when Anna and Bob trade cheese for ham, you could say it's a zero sum game; there are still the same things. But wealth isn't about things - it's about value. The reason Anna and Bob made this trade is because Anna values the ham more than the cheese, and Bob values the cheese more the ham; the total value possessed by Anna and Bob has increased. Wealth can therefor increase for as long as people are willing to trade.

The second question is more complicated. Trade is good because it always increases wealth for those involved in the trade and eventually makes everyone better off - it used to be that poor people starved to death, but now they generally survive. However, accumulated wealth, the essence of capitalism, gives some people power in the free market which others don't have, allowing those with wealth to gain more wealth. Those with less wealth can't act in the free market in the same ways and therefor not compete as successfully.

For instance, a wealthy business (A) can invest in new technologies but a profitable yet not especially wealthy business (B) cannot. A will eventually out compete B because B couldn't invest in the new technology. A can use it's wealth for marketing and even lower prices and operate at a loss because B will certainly go out of business before A does. B, being profitable, could get loans and additional funding from investors but it has to pay for that, one way or an other, while A already has that money, and of course also acquire additional funding.

The same thing is true for a business (and it's owners) vs individual employees. The employee is not wealthy, and can't afford to lose their job - while the business with thousands of employees will barely even notice when someone quits. And then they'll hire someone else. The point of unions is to make the employees as powerful as the businesses, but the threat of outsourcing and automation makes it a largely pointless endeavor.

The result is that, relatively speaking, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. But you can certainly argue that in absolute terms everyone gets a higher standard of living, even the poor.

Reason 1 - There are people in the building. Large buildings are multi tenant, so even if the building has a company name on the side there may be 30 different companies leasing in it. Within those companies you are going to run into 24/7 operations departments including banks dealing with global markets, law offices that work 24/7 on cases,  financial institutions that work overnight to meet deadlines, and Security guards working for high security tenants.  There are also overnight staff who work for the landlord including security, cleaners and operations. Any noisy and or otherwise disruptive construction work happens after hours as well so, large buildings usually have multiple construction projects happening in them overnight. This number of people is small in comparison to daily operations but is still significant. 

Reason 2 - Practicality. Large buildings don't usually have light switches in the traditional sense. The lights (as well as fans, pumps and everything else) run on a Building Automation System (BAS) that has a daytime and night time mode. Night time mode keeps some lights on in the office (will get into why later) This guarantees that even if the office admin forgets to hit the switch when leaving for the day, the lights will go into night mode and only a few lights will be left on. After hours if a worker wants all the lights turned on for a floor, they dial a number and put in a code (unique to that tenant) the lights turn on for a pre-programmed amount of time (usually 2 hours default) and the tenant gets billed. There are also sometimes personal office lights which are not on a program and are instead on a switch. In new offices these are usually on a motion sensor and or a motion sensor which can be turned on / off with a switch. These lights are the responsibility of the employee in that office to turn off.

Reason 3 - Safety and or the illusion of safety. This one is simple, people who work in places late at night feel safer when the lights are on. There are a lot of people who are just generally uneasy when the lights are out.  The fear is that someone is going to jump out from behind a filing cabinet and do bad things to them. The reality is that lights being on does not make the office environment safer from bad guys but security theater is sometimes just as important as actual security.

Reason 4 - Legal stuff. Every place in the world will have some version of a law called something along the lines of ""occupiers liability act"" which states that if you own property and people will be visiting that property for a lawful reason then you have a legal obligation to make it safe for them. How safe? whats reasonable .... whats reasonable? whatever a judge decides based on arguments made by lawyers. Would it be reasonable to have a few lights on if cleaners, operations, security guards, construction workers, late night employees, ect. are going to be walking through the office space late at night? Probably .... 

I might have missed or left out some stuff but I think that is the gist of it. Lighting in high rise office buildings does reduce significantly after hours and I encourage everyone to turn off their personal office lights and or close the blinds at night. One issue all major city's have is migratory birds flying into the glass and being killed. In Toronto we have a program called FLAP (Fatal Light Awareness Program) they encourage people to turn off their lights at night to reduce those casualty's.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, let's take something everybody owns and everybody knows: toilet paper, everyone use it and everyone know what it is. 

on the other hand let's take another consumer good that everybody knows.... fidget spinners!

&amp;#x200B;

Yes you have the stable toilet paper, that won't disappear anytime soon. And you have the biggest hit a fidget spinner.

&amp;#x200B;

Think about the supply chain of the two described products (Supply chain, means the chains getting the raw product, making products in a factory, which finally your factory make into a product, that someone else sells)

&amp;#x200B;

It's easy to see that toilet paper has the supply chain figured out. Your particular factory want paper, and maybe some chemicals. So you buy them from established factories. Your factory has already made a deal with the paper factory and the chemical factory to make weekly drop offs of products, to make toilet paper. Everything runs smooth and safe.

On the fidget spinner side, someone has sniffed the popularity of fidget spinners, so he calls a factory in china he trusts, and he asks them to make 10,000 fidget spinners. Now the whole factory has to change the production to make fidget spinners.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i got to carried away with that analogy xD. 

But basically it all boils down to automation and expectancy. If we bought fidget spinners like we bought toilet papers, some factory would eventually automate a lot of the processes, and the suppliers have to automate a steady supply of plastic and metal to make those fidget spinners.  


Once a clever business guy told me (He made electronics prototypes in the 30,000 category, he had i think 2 big factories in denmark south of århus)

He told me, "" It dosen't matter if it cost double, as long as i can be sure the wares come at the deadline and it is in a good quality"".

Basically what he told me was that if those wares don't come on time the whole factory would be shut down, because they wouldn't have the crucial component the other factory supplied. So he would just as might shut down his whole factory until he got the components.

This is not all, the fact that cars now exist means new things are possible. You can, for example, get paid to drive someone around and now you have a taxi.

Another example is the computer. Not only do we need people to make them or improve them, it opened up the whole field of software programming.

There are two other factors that also greatly effect quality, specifically you notice significant problems of either of these get out of hand.  That is jitter and dropped/out of order packets.  
Latency is the overall delay in time for packets to arrive.  Jitter is the amount of change in latency.
When ever you get that garbled, voice going to robot, it is often an increase in jitter. 
In analog audio, sound we hear in the world, it is a constant stream.  When it’s converted to digital packets, the sound is broken into very small slices and sent.  Those packets are just information like everything else on the network.  They can arrive as a steady stream and in the right order... or they can’t.  The system has a little bit of a buffer to put the bits of sound back together in the right order.  But there is a low tolerance by human ears to errors.  Remember it’s job is to preserve the sense of real-time two-way communication.
If you increase audio quality, you are going to send more data.  (Or roll out new compression, but that software has to work on all of your existing equipment $$$) So either the packet size gets bigger, or you have to send more packets.  Each exposes you to more risk.  A dropped big packet of data, the more likely there is a pause as it’s re-sent.  More overall packets, the more sensitive to jitter it becomes.  
So really it’s a compromise.

So for a venue like a live concert, the station will run a mobile production unit. Essentially a small TV studio packed in the back of a box truck. Several EFP (electronic field production) cameras will be set up around the venue. You'll usually have one wide and one for closeups for a basic shoot. Bigger productions will have more for different shots. Overhead, jib (camera on a boom arm), action cameras (like a goal cam for sports), etc. These will be connected back to the truck's CCU (camera control unit) via long cables. The CCU lets operators inside the truck adjust camera colour and iris, or remotely control some cameras. 

The CCUs are connected to a switcher. Which is exactly what it sounds like. It's a big routing panel with all the cameras listed on it, as well as any graphics or pre-recorded video sources. The technical director will switch between cameras, as well as tell camera operators which shots they want and which camera they're going live to next. You'll hear them give directions like ""ready one, take one"", to instruct Camera One's operator to stand by, and that they're now on the air.

Audio is pumped in from microphones through a separate sound mixing board. Usually through XLR cables. Sometimes through the cameras depending on the setup. It gets combined with the video inside the switcher. 

The truck then sends the signal back to the station; either using satellites, microwave (those big masts you sometimes see on top of them), cellular (becoming more common), or fiber optic feeds (for frequently used venues). Back at the station, these get sent to master control. 

Master control runs the station's automation software. They have a big playlist with the live sources, pre-taped shows, and any commercial breaks. The live feed comes into the main router where it's fed to the channel servers. Master control operators will then provide time queues for the truck and manually role any breaks. They also monitor the feeds for quality.

The 5G requirements have been defined in terms of new services and markets by SA1, under the ""SMARTER"" work item. These are defined mostly in TS 22.261 [1], which describes different types of requirements for different 5G usage:

-	Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB): the requirements are defined on high data rates, higher traffic or connection density, high user mobility, and the requirements related to various deployment and coverage scenarios. The scenarios address different service areas (e.g., indoor/outdoor , urban and rural areas, office and home, local and wide areas connectivity), and special deployments (e.g., massive gatherings, broadcast, residential, and high-speed vehicles). The scenarios and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.1-1 of TS 22.261 [1]. For instance, for the downlink, experienced data rate of up to 50 Mbps are expected outdoor and 1 Gbps indoor (5GLAN), and half of these values for the uplink. For services to an airplane, a bitrate of 1,2 Gbps is expected per plane.

-	Critical Communications (CC) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC): Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high communications service availability. These are driven by the new services such as industrial automation. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which may be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the services. The scenarios and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.2.2-1 of TS 22.261 [1]. For instance, in the context of remote control for process automation, a reliability of 99,9999% is expected, with a user experienced data rate up to 100 Mbps and an end-to-end latency of 50 ms. This is provided in particular through the Edge Computing capability described below.

-	Massive Internet of Things (mIoT). Several scenarios require the 5G system to support very high traffic densities of devices. The Massive Internet of Things requirements include the operational aspects that apply to the wide range of IoT devices and services anticipated in the 5G timeframe. 

-	Flexible network operations. These are a set of specificities offered by the 5G system, as detailed in the following sections. It covers aspects such as network slicing, network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility, security, efficient content delivery, and migration and interworking.",1558989468,{},ep1i3db,False,t3_btna08,False,True,t3_btna08,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/btna08/eli5_how_does_5g_wireless_technology_work/ep1i3db/,1558989593.0,4,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,1559667370.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

3. once you have a rough mix, automate a lot of stuff. that's where you get changing dynamics and generally sense of progression into a track through the mix. people think you just automate volume and filters. i dunno, i automate compression, reverb, limiters, imagers. pretty much everything. think of like a vocalist finishes his phrase dramatically. so automate a small (high end) portion of the stereo image on the chorus fx of the vocal so you have a small sense of the lyric opening and poking above and outwards from the instrumental. shit like that. automation isn't spoken about enough in tutorials.",1558906230,{},eow7xv0,False,t3_bt7vzy,False,True,t1_eow4ilp,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/bt7vzy/eli5_what_makes_a_voice_sound_pleasantunpleasant/eow7xv0/,1558906242.0,2,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,1559622982.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. Unions only help lifelong employees. If you're not planning to spend decades working in the company, a union is bad deal. Unions pile the greatest rewards on the long-serving employees, so if you're only working for 5 years on the job you're actually getting less than you would have in a non-union shop.

I think this starts out with someone writing AI that involves a simple algorithm that is densely packed with if and else statements - which is what some simple AIs actually are, e.g. Final Fantasy's turn-based AIs.

Then when people think ""well, if and else statements are in all code"", this is sometimes extended to ""all programming is just if and else statements"". Is it?

No. If and else statements are high level control flow constructs. They are important, but if you want to get down to it, programming is about writing a sequence of instructions. Control flow constructs like if and else are important in high level source code, but that's all you can say.

It wasn't bad per say, but i dont really have much glowing good things to say about it either.  IMHO KH3 took all the good from KH2 and improved on it, then took all the bad and made some of the best parts of 3. The gummy ship sections i hated before was some if my favorite parts in 3. They made it an open world you can roam and figh battles, hunt for rare items, and navigate complex structures while fighting you way through. 

They gave each keyblade unique powers,  from abilities, to forms, to summons. It was more than just more stats and a different cosmetic.  They incorporated those abilities along with ride theme battle abilities into the flow of combat flawlessly.  It never felt cluttered or choppy like i was afraid it would before playing it.

You got to keep all 3 party members on worlds and the individual world characters came along as back up, rather than having to abandon a core member and having level and gear difference.  They each brought unique battle commands. 

The story blew 2 out of the water, and they handled the lore problems well enough. 

The difficult didnt widely fluctuate like 2 did at times.  

The new graphics were meh at first, but they put them to full use later on and overall the game was beautiful graphics wise.

The theme song was actually a really good EDM remix done by skrillex and the girl who normally does the songs. Its not as memorable as simple and clean, but its close.

So, yeah. My only complaint was the stupid way they hamfisted social media and technology into the story,  and i felt like they kind of turned riku and sora into bland whiny androgynous final fantasy characters with spiky hair, or every FF protagonist ever. Those are really my only complaints and they are vastly overshadowed by what they did right.  Its a A+ in my book.  The ammount of content is insane and its easy to not realize.  Ive yet to play through and not find something new yet.

Well, the atoms hit [the walls of their container] harder because they are moving faster, and in addition they hit more often, so the pressure increases. You see how simple the ideas of atomic theory are. 

If we take this and don‘t fix the density, but rather the pressure (gas in a room will always have very low pressure differences between different areas), then we can see that the density will decrease.
