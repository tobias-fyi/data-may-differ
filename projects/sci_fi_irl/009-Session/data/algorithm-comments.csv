There'll always be people wanting that human touch, as fuzzy as that'll get.

But is that the majority of artists? No, what media synthesis threatens, as you said, is *commercial* artists. What happens when movies and other high budget productions cut down on matte painters and background artists for just an art director with a bevy of neural networks for comparable results? What about colorists for graphic novels or manga? Why would people hire artists on patreon or deviant art for 30-50-100 dollars for a picture of their OC when an app could make it for them?

Oh, they'll be plenty talking up and advertising the skill of the artists in response. ""This movie is 100% human made."" ""An artstyle you won't find with any machine.""""This wasn't made by a soulless algorithm.""   But is that what *most* people look for? Do CEOs care about the ""soul"" of a matte painting when their trying to penny pinch a production? Are consumers looking for the ""soul"" of how a CG object in a movie was made? Does a production company care about the ""soul"" of how their comic books were colored as long as it was done fast?

[],Cyaed,,gray,[],,Discordian Ethicist,dark,text,t2_tf6ig,False,[],"""Wasting"" qubits is a fait accompli of general purpose quantum architectures. They need to be spent on error correction. Classical computers also ""waste"" transistors - look up parity bits some time. If it still seems like quantum computers are inherently worse.... Well, they are. Right now, the best quantum computers are around where classical computers were in the 1960s at best. Still, though: while a quantum computer might be worse that a classical computer for the types of problems that classical computers excel at, if we use it for that problem, we're doing it wrong.

Computer algorithms are classified according to their *time complexity*. This is a measure of how fast they run. Two important classes are P and NP. P stands for **P**olynomial time complexity. Any algorithm in P runs in an amount of time that can be described as a polynomial. NP stands for **N**on**p**olynomial, and contains algorithms that - as you increase the amount of data they need to crunch - are eventually slower than anything in P. 

Quantum computers are special because they can run algorithms in yet another time complexity class called BQP at the same speed as a classical computer runs algorithms in P. When a classical computer tries running something in BQP, at best it will run BQP in NP, and at worst it will run in an even slower time complexity like EXPTIME (time complexity that can be described with an exponential).

Being able to tackle BQP problems in polynomial time means being able to do things like directly simulate protein folding without any simplifications, or being able to do a brute force search for room-temperture superconductors considering thousands of cnadidate materials a day - currently scientists have to figure out how to manufacture a material before they can determine superconductivity. By the same token, we would be able to create evolutionary algorithms to build nanomachinery, or to create hyper-effective drugs and then verify that they were safe digitally by making sure they didn't interact with any biomolecules. Imagine artificial viruses that only killed cancer cells with total lethality. The standard model of physics is good enough that if we had the machines, we could simulate the universe in acceptable detail to fully digitise and automate  - but classical computers aren't those machines.

Quantum computers *are*.

That we have to spend a few qubits dealing with the uncertainty doesn't change the fact that a quantum machine will be able to do in minutes what would take a classical computer the size of jupiter longer than the expected lifetime of the universe to accomplish, in it's field of excellence. Don't knock it.

In theory quantum computers can run a statistical calculation and compute all of the outcomes simultaneously instead of one at a time. Obviously this is massive speed up when there are many many outcomes to an algorithm.

A bit is the smallest piece of information a computer can store and manipulate. A bit can be one or zero. Pack 8 bits together and you get a byte. 1024 of those together and you get a kilobyte, 1024 kilobytes is a megabyte and so on and so forth. A qubit can be a one or zero aswell, it can also be any number between one and zero, at the same time. In fact a qubit represents every value from 1-0 but the chance of it being any specific number follows a probability curve and only resolves to an actual number when measures. You can take advantage of that super position by running calculations before it's observed, thus allowing you to traverse a massive amount of calculations simultaneously.

The problem? Qubits are VERY sensitive to the outside world and will spontaneous collapse into regular information if not kept under ideal conditions. A long lived quibit only exists for a few nano seconds. You can see how it would be hard to take advantage of this state when you're trying to get many qubits to interact. Beyond that, because each qubit represents a probability, everything can go perfectly and still give you the wrong answer by pure chance. You need to run operation many times to build up a map of what is the correct answer by measuring what outcome happens the most often.

According to Johnson, they indicate that the algorithm can predict the start of a slow slip earthquake to “within a few days — and possibly better.”

&gt;The Los Alamos group is betting that their algorithms won’t actually need to train on catastrophic earthquakes to predict them.

I didn't make these algorithms, but my guess would be that algorithms that target by race are too politically contentious (and as a result would be a pain to impliment). There also good arguements to make about potentially biasing a system that already exhibits racial bias throughout.

&gt;What makes other traits different? 

A very long and very storied history of subjugation and discrimination.

Race isn't the same as economic status, educational attainment, and other similar recidivism correlates. 

&gt;Gang affiliation etc. *is already wrong* - these things are crimes and therefore should be considered. 

Being in gang isn't a defacto crime. It's a trait correlated with criminal behavior.  

&gt;There are many things which correlate with recidivism which are *not* wrong, or illegal, and punishing people for doing them is unjust. 

Again, if we have a societal interest in not over jailing people who don't represent a societal risk and not letting people who represent a societal risk wander the streets we should be using all the information available. 

We also need to be comparing/contrasting this with our current system where a person (who can have all sorts of biases) is making this decision blind based on basically no information besides how they feel about the person awaiting sentencing/a parole hearing. 

&gt;The idea that so many people are OK with profiling if a computer does it is deeply disturbing to me.

Let me echo your concern. There is absolutely a wrong way to do this. Math isn't biased but crap in equals crap out. It's extremely important to ensure training data isn't just echoing previous bias and algorithms need to be vetted thoroughly. But that said if it can accurately bin recidivism rates, we also shouldn't ignore that information particularly when deciding who gets off early for good behavior.

In short, our algorithm provides *certifiably optimal* human-interpretable ML models; i.e., given the parameters and dataset you train with, it's guaranteed that the resulting model will be optimal on the training set (there's some regularization to prevent against overfitting, etc). No randomness that might lead to getting a substandard model, etc.

We targeted the recidivism prediction problem as a critical application where XAI is necessary due to social implications. The COMPAS model used by the US government for this problem is known to be racially biased (https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing). So in order to make sure you're not being racially biased and to be able to confirm that, you want the model to be interpretable. A judge should be able to know why the predictions should be made in the way they are before using them to assign sentences to defendants.

One thing that is really problematic is the insistence of many working with AI to claim that black-box (non-interpretable) models are necessary to provide good predictive accuracy. This is flat-out not the case: the COMPAS model is black-box, and gives you the same accuracy as our CORELS model (around 66%).

These algorithms are almost always made to be race blind. 

&gt;One likes to go out at night, one likes to stay at home. Etc. Etc.

I'm pretty sure going out vs staying home isn't a correlate to recidivism. 

Let's try a variable almost certainly correlated: gang affiliation.


&gt;In a just system, these two people receive the exact same sentence.

In a just system we tailor sentences based on the danger to society the offender presents and the ability the system has to rehab the offender.⁸

&gt;This is a fact, not an opinion. 

Apparently you don't know what a fact is. 

&gt;It's a tautology of justice. 

Justice has lots of definitions based on your ethics, etc. It isn't something that can be objectively assigned. 


&gt;The only thing which should determine their sentence is the crime/crimes which they have committed.

This is a terrible idea for so many ideas and goes against your entire ""individuals cannot be binned in meaningful ways"" arguement you make later.

You have two cases. A teenage girl who while sending a text message while driving hits a jaywalkers and kills them. Ends up charged with vehicular manslaughter. 

A man with long known gang affiliation (but who has no prior conviction history despite previous legal run ins) runs down a rivial gang member. Its suspected to be intentional, but due to lack of evidence of murderous intent also gets charged with vehicular manslaughter. 

No sane system would punish these actions exactly the same. 

&gt;However no algorithm would claim these two people have the same reoffense rate.

No one is saying you that know exactly who will commit a crime. If we knew who exactly who was going to end up back in prison you would just not let those people out and not bother with probation for the people you knew were going to live crime free productive lives.

What you do know is the *likelyhood* a individual will commit a crime (and again this is an empirically testable fact). If we care at all about things like releasing people who don't present a danger to society and not releasing people who will reoffend, knowing the relative risk of recidivism is important.

This is a fact, not an opinion. It's a tautology of justice. The only thing which should determine their sentence is the crime/crimes which they have committed. However no algorithm would claim these two people have the same reoffense rate.

[],ALoneTennoOperative,,,[],,,,text,t2_16ov1t9,False,,"&gt; I honestly don't know why that's even causing a fuss.

I would like you to consider a hypothetical:

Imagine a version of the USA, where technology is 70 years more advanced than it is in our own timeline.  
*Everything else* is the same, but the technologies available are ahead of their time.

Now imagine that someone proposes utilising this facial-recognition technology to prevent violence and disruptive behaviour on public transportation systems.  
If you've been violent or dodged paying fares or otherwise been a troublemaker, you're not allowed on the bus.  
Great idea, right?! It's put in place, crime on public transport goes way down, the world is safer.

Except... in the 1900s, racial segregation was in full swing.

With this system in place, Rosa Parks would have been denied entry to the bus in 1955.  
(She was a known activist, *had been arrested before* for refusing to give up her seat, and was even secretary of the NAACP.)  
She would never have been able to protest being asked to give up her seat.  
Those laws would not have been challenged and changed as a result of that arrest.

&amp;nbsp;

The above hypothetical even assumes that the recognition algorithm is flawless, that it is 100% accurate.  

Except that *we* know that in actuality algorithms like this tend to have biases, and they're *particularly* ineffective when it comes to accurately identifying people of colour.  
Who provides oversight over the algorithms and technologies put in place? Who is going to test them for biases and risks?  
... who's going to admit they're flawed and dangerous?  
(The developers? The police? The governmental authorities that paid for them?)

If the algorithm says ""This Black person is a dangerous murderer with a warrant out for their arrest"", and the police roll up armed and expecting violence... what do you think the odds are of the innocent false positive suffering harm?  
Would they have been exposed to the same risk *without* such a technology in play?

To address your concern with facial recognition, but the AI/algorithm used for facial recognition doesn't have to constantly be in use. It's kind of like how your  smartphone can listen for ""Ok google"" or ""hey siri"" without the need to constantly send your voice data to apple or google. It only transmits data when the key phrase was used, everything else is private. So ideally you'd only actually use facial recognition with a warrant. 

Now, the risk assessment tools are not as simple, but you can certainly do better than police/judges. I'm not sure where you think manipulation can take place but so long as their is a lot of transparency and experts involved, that risk is greatly reduced. It can be bias if not enough data is used, for example it would need to weigh certain aspects differently. You would want the racial component of the algorithm to be non-existent (or at least close to non-existent) because there's other factors at play like income, education, etc that all make it more likely for someone to want to enter a life of crime. 

That said, it would be better to just not use these tools at all and focus on the root of the problem, what makes people gravitate towards crime.

For example, black people commit robbery at a rate that is more frequent than white people, and whites people commit DUIs at a rate that is much higher than black people. An algorithm could take that into account if we wanted it to. A black robber might have an extra point count against them compared to a white robber, but both are still going to get twenty points for robbery either way. Same thing for a DUI, where a white offender will have an additional point counted against them but they’d still get the 20 points just for the DUI. They’ll also get more or less points based on their prior histories. So in the end the one point for race doesn’t mean as much as the other factors. Is that disparate treatment if we do see differences in offending by race? Not really. But it can still be problematic. And if we wanted to, we could just not count the point for race. You literally just remove one variable from the equation. So if we decide race shouldn’t be counted we just remove it from the occasion—and personally, that’s what I’m in favor of.

The bigger disparity comes in with gender. They often need to create completely separate algorithms for men and women because men and women just offend so differently. If we used a single algorithm, it’s going to be more influenced by men in the system since there are so many more men who commit crimes.

Imagine your [fitness tracker](https://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/10-best-fitness-trackers-1277905) vibrates on your wrist – but it’s not because you’ve reached your 10,000 steps goal for the day or because you’ve received an email. Instead, your tracker is warning you that your blood pressure is high, your doctor has seen the stats in real-time and they want you to de-stress. Or maybe an analysis of your sweat is showing you’re a little too dehydrated. Or maybe the air around you is full of allergens and could set off your asthma.

The sensors within our fitness trackers have improved greatly in recent years. We now have more accurate heart rate monitors, accelerometers to detect the smallest changes in movement and positioning, and even ECG sensors in devices like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 and Amazfit Verge 2 to flag up issues with our hearts.

But many experts believe this is just the beginning and soon our fitness trackers will be packed with an even wider range of sensors to collect data that could, potentially, save our lives, diagnose illnesses and keep our doctors constantly updated.

## Advancing sensors

For fitness trackers to become valuable health tools and diagnostic devices in the future, they’ll need even more sensors. Right now, there are many different sensor technologies in development that could tell you more about your body – and the atmosphere around you – in the not-so-distant future.

As far as an all meat diet increasing the risk of cancer and heart disease.  You aren't going to find any research to support (or dispute) that claim, because that research hasn't been done.  

There have been some studies that show an correlation between meat consumption and heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

I haven’t actively perused the sub in years but, before 2016, the many top scoring submissions very consistently came from comparatively few usernames. These usernames used to have post karma scores in the millions, before Reddit changes its vote fuzzing algorithm and most top scoring posts only had around 1-2k upvotes. These user’s submissions would very consistently score 1-2k upvotes across different subreddits and this would often happen over a dozen times daily. Back then, desktop Reddit used to give you a warning when you were making a repost. It was virtually impossible to post a national headline without getting a warning that the story was already posted several times before, even if the headline was only about an hour old. 

All this points to the submissions of certain usernames being automated with scripts and a fairly high likelihood of vote manipulation.

[],FrankBattaglia,,,[],,,,text,t2_1jg1y,False,,"Not necessarily.  Most encryptions systems in widespread use are “public key” systems.  This means I give you (or everybody in the world) one key (the public key), while I keep another key secret (the secret key).  You can use the public key to encrypt a message, and then I use the private key to decrypt the message.  For that system to work, there has to be a very specific mathematical relationship between the public key and the private key.  Well, if everybody has the public key, you want to make sure they can’t use that mathematical relationship to figure out the private key, otherwise they can decrypt all your messages.

Standard encryption uses relationships that are relatively easy to pick a private key and generate a corresponding public key, but “very hard” to calculate in the other direction.  We’re talking “it would take billions of years for a classical computer to get from the public key back to the private key” type relationships.

There are a few well-know relationships having those properties: e.g., factorization, discrete logarithms, and elliptic curves.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), it seems quantum computers are particularly good at solving those types of relationships.  So any public key system using those relationships would be vulnerable to attack by a quantum computer.

Cryptocurrencies (and blockchains in general) use a different cryptographic technology known as a cryptographic hash.  These problems take an input and “scramble” it in a specific way so that it’s “very hard” to calculate the original input (but if somebody gave you that input again, you could scramble it and verify the scrambled outputs matched).  As you may intuit, without the need for a matching public / private key pair, there are significantly fewer constraints on what the scrambling algorithm can do.  Most of the widely used hashing (i.e., scrambling) algorithms use entirely different mathematics from public key systems, and those mathematics do not appear to be nearly so vulnerable to quantum computing.

A passage I found especially interesting from *Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow by Yuval Noah Harari*

&gt;A recent study commissioned by Google’s nemesis – Facebook – has indicated that already today the Facebook algorithm is a better judge of human personalities and dispositions than even people’s friends, parents and spouses. The study was conducted on 86,220 volunteers who have a Facebook account and who completed a hundred-item personality questionnaire.

&gt;The Facebook algorithm predicted the volunteers’ answers based on monitoring their Facebook Likes – which webpages, images and clips they tagged with the Like button. The more Likes, the more accurate the predictions. The algorithm’s predictions were compared with those of work colleagues, friends, family members and spouses.

&gt;Amazingly, the algorithm needed a set of only ten Likes in order to outperform the predictions of work colleagues. It needed seventy Likes to outperform friends, 150 Likes to outperform family members and 300 Likes to outperform spouses. In other words, if you happen to have clicked 300 Likes on your Facebook account, the Facebook algorithm can predict your opinions and desires better than your husband or wife!",1568699553,{},f0l5j4a,False,t3_d56x6o,False,True,t1_f0l4szv,/r/technology/comments/d56x6o/the_new_iphone_software_update_is_already/f0l5j4a/,1568699554.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I disagree with the reference’s assessment, b/c it allows the EU to break itself up into parts. If that’s the case, then the US should also be fragmented to avoid counting its actual emissions. But hey, reasonable informed people can disagree without name calling. In any assessment, China and India and Russia have the most centralized industrial sources of pollution. In the US, tailpipe emissions are the largest source. It’s anti-American to attack Americans on a per capital basis for driving. Americans don’t have a choice. Rich people have prevented reasonable public transportation for over 100 years. Meanwhile rich people are enriching themselves and birthing new billionaires in China and India by exploiting the earth and polluting at the nation state level. It’s anti-American to criticize Americans for polluting when driving and to put them at an economic disadvantage to India and China, which are polluting on a continental scale and literally killing two oceans with carbon pollution that causes coral bleaching.

Massive fuels are actually SO IN right now. The idea is to eject mass out the back, having a massive fuel can help with that!

&gt; Methane is cheaper, easier to work with

Methanol (or ethanol) are cheap and far easier to work with, at least barring chemical compatibility issues you speak of. Why cool your fuel so much to get it to densify and become a liquid when it can just be a dense liquid at normal temps?

&gt; Its pretty easy to make a passive heat shield last forever, plenty of suitable materials available.

Until you prang it on something. Landing and taking off is a violent situation. Chances of mishaps are high. As you mention with the chunks of ice and foam on the shuttle. Airlines have to consider the costs of replacing parts that should ""last forever"" but fail due to unexpected situations. The same will apply to SpaceX if they make a ""long-lasting"" rocket.

&gt; Again, the only metric that matters is cost.

Nope. Sometimes capacity matters. It's cheaper to run an existing rocket and not land it next to the pad than to make a 10% larger rocket so that it can take the same payload and return.

&gt; the solution is to simply build a bigger rocket if you have payloads that are incompatible with RTLS

Haha. You get done telling me how valuable standardization is and now you say to just build a oneoff to save money! You aren't actually making any sense.

Combine that with images/scans and it will say ""well I'm 60% sure I see something at this angle, 80% sure at this angle and 20% sure at this angle"" - it will then come back with a 'I am x percent sure that I've identified whatever I'm looking for in this image' - the binary output is just humans giving it a threshold. 

&gt; expected to say what out of dozens of possibilities the patient has, or combinations of multiple conditions.

If its trained on all those dozens of possibilities, then this wont be a problem.  

&gt; I think we have a long, long way to go before AI ever replaces doctors in reading images.

Your thinking is too binary. Medical professionals will never be completely removed from the image reading process - but the pipeline will be changed, especially as the face of medicine changes. Initial passes will be done with machines - should an anomaly be detected it will be flagged for further review by a human that can make the diagnosis. 

If you think that we're a long, long way off, take a minute to consider that the majority of industry standard deep learning software (Microsoft CNTK, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Karas, etc..) were only developed and released in the past 3 years, and each year (sometimes even month) practitioners are absolutely smoking the previous years performance measures. That's why there is so much hype - because people can apply these techniques to real world problems - outside of labs and academia.

These sorts of studies are good at grabbing headlines but the thing which everyone in the field brings up but which is rarely translated to this kind of Reddit ""regular"" discussion is the generalisability of these programs.

Typically speaking, a machine learning experiment will get a bunch of images of healthy people and a bunch of images of people with e.g. a kind of brain tumour. Their ML algorithm is then trained on this dataset to discriminate between the two, and subsequently is tested on a new set and often is pretty damn good at the job.

The issue is the noise present in medical data. In this case, MRI brain scans within a given study will have all been collected on the same scanner with identical acquisition parameters. When you introduce hospital #2 into the equation, who also have a 3T machine but it's made by Philips instead of GE and their T1 sequence had got marginally different echo and repetition times... then the algorithm falls apart because its just as sensitive to systematic differences in the images due to the new set of scans as it is to tumours vs. healthy tissue. i.e. It'll pick up people as having a disease just because they were scanned at a different hospital.

Some studies address this by training on multiple sets of data, but you'll still only be looking at like 3 sites when actual clinical implementation would need to cover so much more variability than that.

They do more than just read scans. The contextual information is vital with regards to diagnosis, which is the point. Again, what does 86% accuracy with regards to polyp identification from a radiology AI mean for the treatment plan, in normative terms? Would you risk going with a AI program that has 86% accuracy with regard to just finding polyps, not whether they are cancerous or not, if it was someone in your family? 

I'm extremely skeptical of such ambitious proclamations as ""there will be no more applied radiologists at hospitals,"" and I would like to complicate that notion, if I could. I do think it is possible that there will be fewer radiologists, as it isn't an especially popular specialty despite the pay and the growth in the job market, which American med schools can barely fill, as during Match less than 1000 of all radiology sub-specialties were filled. The BLS data suggests a growth rate of 15%, which means that there will be around 5000 new positions for radiologists yearly to the mid-2020s, which doesn't indicate the specialty being phased out. 

Even then, if these programs can be developed with solid metrics in mind, they would be trained faster with ""labeled data."" Every program that has achieved a high level of success in nearly all of these studies had been trained on labeled images. But there is no labeling repository for radiographic images; if there were, I'd imagine there would be a lot quicker improvement in these programs. I know of one company that employs radiologists for the sole purpose of labeling images. For comprehensive accumulation of images for training, you will almost certainly need radiologists to compile that data, label it and organize it. Even still, given that radiology is a specialty that is created because of technological advancements, it's just as likely that the role of radiologist will shift, and the need will still be as great as these programs proliferate. 

There are also massive issues with regard to liabilities. Who is responsible if an algorithm misses a cancer case? Would it be the vendor, who no doubt will promise high accuracy? Which physician would be responsible? Would the hospital take on that liability? It's almost assured that these issues will be ironed out much slower than the pace of technology. Once liability issues are resolved, there is the whole issue of regulation and payment. I'd wager that the FDA would issue stipulations that require a radiologist trained in the program to be present when the scan is running, as that is the easiest way of determining liability, as well as satisfy any possible new requirements for insurance reimbursement.

Or maybe, ""we put in this gastic tube to feed our patient and want to make sure its in the stomach."" These are basic questions that can be automated, send a thousand pictures of different lines or tubes in right or wrong places and I'm sure a machine can figure it out. 

Those questions are basic questions but are a minority of what radiologist deal with. For example a radiologist might get the question ""we have this complicated patient with a fever who isn't improving on antibiotics and we are worried about an abscess."" Radiologist gets a CT scan, does the read, and finds different signs indicative of two or three other possibilities. The physician then calls the radiologist to discuss the case with the radiologist and maybe after the discussion the radiologist recommends another kind of study based on their own understand of the literature, based on their own understand of the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging modalities available for the conditions being considered, based on what the studies the patient may or may not be able to tolerate.

&gt; Really, the pattern (of readiness potential) would simply reflect how various factors had happened to coincide.

Basically, the consideration of when. ""Now? Now? Now? Now? Now!"" So all of these spikes aren't the decision itself.

In Libet's experiment

&gt; To decide when to tap their fingers, the participants simply acted whenever the moment struck them. Those spontaneous moments, Schurger reasoned, must have coincided with the haphazard ebb and flow of the participants’ brain activity (""readiness potential""). **They would have been more likely to tap their fingers when their motor system happened to be closer to a threshold for movement initiation.**

&gt; In a new study under review for publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Schurger and two Princeton researchers repeated a version of Libet’s experiment. To avoid unintentionally cherry-picking brain noise, they included a control condition in which people didn’t move at all. An artificial-intelligence classifier allowed them to find at what point brain activity in the two conditions diverged. If Libet was right, that should have happened at 500 milliseconds before the movement. But the algorithm couldn’t tell any difference until about only 150 milliseconds before the movement, the time people reported making decisions in Libet’s original experiment.

&gt; **In other words, people’s subjective experience of a decision—what Libet’s study seemed to suggest was just an illusion—appeared to match the actual moment their brains showed them making a decision.**

There's still a lot more work to be done, but this claims that decisions are made at the moment we are conscious of them, 150 ms before the action. 

Ultimately, whether a decision is made before we are conscious of it is also irrelevant to the validity of free will.

Hmm..  I don't think you understand information entropy either.  For many things, information entropy is easy to define, like a picture with a fixed resolution and dynamic range or an audio file of a song at a specific recording frequency.  From that, you can identify the complexity of the information, such that repeating patterns can be identified with small units of information.  Of course, the more patterns there are, the more complex the information is, and therefore the more bits will be required to store it.

What the authors have done is excluded a ton of contextual information, and instead focused on the units of speech as the information content, and then performed an approximate entropy analysis across multiple languages, using syllables as the unit (as per the linked article, didn't read the science article, so maybe there's a bit of voodoo between the press release and the article).

I think what you don't get is that information theory doesn't work that way.  You don't get to argue that google.com is only a couple bits because the web address is short.  Information theory calculations work great for assessing computers, because you can compute the upper limit of information that can be carried on how many channels at what frequency.  You can rank compression algorithms by how close they get to a theoretical limit (you can even cheat at those by optimizing your algorithm for a specific test case).  

But what computer entropy researchers understand is that theoretical has to be paired with practical.  If you need to send a 1GB file to a friend (file.dat), you need to know how long it's going to take to compress the file, how long it's going to take to send it across your pipe, and how long it's going to take to decompress it.  So the winning algorithms are the ones that minimize total travel time so that you don't spend extra time compressing a file that could have been sent faster a little larger.  However, you don't just look at the bandwidth of the network connection and therefore conclude computers operate at 1000Gb/s.  That's what this paper is doing - looking at the network connection and ignoring the rest.  By putting a number on the bits of transfer, they're implying that communication is relatively slow - when it's not.  The number of ideas that are triggered by a few joined syllables are pretty large, not just 1 or 2 bits.

This is not a new idea in neuroscience.  This is what lots of people do - do some reductionist calculation that makes our sensory systems seem like they barely process any information, and make big claims about how stupid we all are.  But they miss the larger picture when they do that, because we're **really** efficient at processing, sending and recieving information.  It's that we use a ton of short-hand to get there.  And if anyone wants to calculate the bitrate of human perception, they have to take into account the complexity of information representation.  It's like having an infinite number of symbols, but only being able to process one per second - is that a bitrate of 1/s or infinity/s?  Yes, this number is calculable if you make some assumptions (e.g. that there's about 15,000 syllables in the english language, and all syllables are the same), but doing that is basically just an exercise that serves no useful purpose until they can understand the full symbol set one is working with.

&gt; The research, published in Cognitive Science, adds to the existing evidence that adults, children and students of all ages learn better when seeing an object before hearing its description. The study builds on past research by focusing on learning in “inconsistent” environments featuring different teaching styles or distracting noises.

Abstract

Learning in natural environments is often characterized by a degree of inconsistency from an input. These inconsistencies occur, for example, when learning from more than one source, or when the presence of environmental noise distorts incoming information; as a result, the task faced by the learner becomes ambiguous. In this study, we investigate how learners handle such situations. We focus on the setting where a learner receives and processes a sequence of utterances to master associations between objects and their labels, where the source is inconsistent by design: It uses both “correct” and “incorrect” object‐label pairings. We hypothesize that depending on the order of presentation, the result of the learning may be different. To this end, we consider two types of symbolic learning procedures: the Object‐Label (OL) and the Label‐Object (LO) process. In the OL process, the learner is first exposed to the object, and then the label. In the LO process, this order is reversed. We perform experiments with human subjects, and also construct a computational model that is based on a nonlinear stochastic reinforcement learning algorithm. It is observed experimentally that OL learners are generally better at processing inconsistent input compared to LO learners. We show that the patterns observed in the learning experiments can be reproduced in the simulations if the model includes (a) an ability to regularize the input (and also to do the opposite, i.e., undermatch) and (b) an ability to take account of implicit negative evidence (i.e., interactions among different objects/labels). The model suggests that while both types of learners utilize implicit negative evidence in a similar way, there is a difference in regularization patterns: OL learners regularize the input, whereas LO learners undermatch. As a result, OL learners are able to form a more consistent system of image‐utterance associations, despite the ambiguous learning task.",1564089697,{},euxnydl,True,t3_chtpf5,False,True,t3_chtpf5,/r/science/comments/chtpf5/new_study_explains_secret_to_more_efficient/euxnydl/,1564089955.0,1,True,,False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TL;DR: A group at LBNL developed a algorithm that, when fed 90 years of abstracts of materials science papers, was able to recapitulate the underlying trends of the periodic table and predict materials for revolutionary applications. The technique centers around the Word2Vec algorithm, which takes the natural language of words and maps them to vectors, and then uses the similarities between the vectors to solve analogies and predict data. This is much more straightforward in a field like materials science, which is relatively well-organized; there are certain properties that we know well and assays that are generally consistent. In a field like molecular biology, this is a lot less directly applicable. However, hopefully this can be modified and optimized for more fields soon!",1563814675,{},eugto5v,True,t3_cgfpn5,False,True,t3_cgfpn5,/r/science/comments/cgfpn5/machinemining_the_literature_a_machine_learning/eugto5v/,1563814686.0,2,True,,False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,1563901078.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd argue that the only real challenge is the ecosystem, and this doesn't represent the challenge that might popularly suppose to be the case.

Firstly, there are no real technical challenges to, for example, constructing a staging post on the moon, which is not really that much of a challenge. It's also fairly sure that this would be the same first stage to be undertaken on a Mars mission, which is also well within our technological capabilities. Indeed, the only technical challenge to a current Mars mission is having a robust means of escaping the gravity of Mars for a return mission, and we still don't really know enough about what resources we can mine on Mars for such a return. That's one of the major motivations for the continued sending of probes, so that we can better understand the geology of Mars. 

Ultimately, the notion that our not having done so means that it's beyond our technical expertise commits any number of fallacies of relevance.

Hell, even a simple space elevator, entirely attainable by current technological means with advances in carbon-bonding technology such as nanotubes, hugely reduces such challenges. The largest cost in fuel is expended in escaping the planet. Further, such a device would have a net operating cost in energy terms of somewhere slightly above zero, as the mass going up would often be offset by the mass going down. This means that you could get a lot of mass up there without a preposterous cost in fuel and, more importantly, this would not form part of the vehicle's fuel budget, because it could leave from orbit (or the moon or orbit thereof) with full tanks.

Oxygen recycling is routinely used, hydroponics is even done in ordinary homes to grow the best weed, and can also reasonably solve the food issue, and water can also be recycled.

As for complete isolation, that's a matter of sending sufficient people to mitigate it. This is a not insignificant issue, but it also isn't a technical or technological one. Having sufficient people willing to go isn't a problem (I'd go, and I know my fiancée would, as would very many of my friends).

There's very little about the best suggestions for a manned Mars mission that would differ from a manned mission to Andromeda.

&gt;     kitten → sitten (substitution of ""s"" for ""k"")
    sitten → sittin (substitution of ""i"" for ""e"")
    sittin → sitting (insertion of ""g"" at the end).

This is a general algorithm that isn't specialised for spell checking.  At this point you could match a word that isn't recognised in the dictionary to the closest matching word, for example you could change ""recognized"" to ""recognised"" or vice versa depending on which region you are in as it is 1 change difference.  If it came across the misspelling ""hse"" it would incorrectly think that the correct word is ""he"" because that's 1 change of deleting the ""s"".

A more advanced comparison which recognises that swapping the order of two letters is the most common way people misspell something is the Damerau–Levenshtein distance which includes swapping the order of letters to the standard add, remove, swap of the base algorithm.  [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance).

In addition to having a general comparison method many spell checkers will include a whole big list of common misspellings.  ""Fone -&gt; Phone"" for example.  Most of the corrections that happen will be done by looking in this list of common misspellings.

Google can also use what other people have searched for to figure out what you are searching for,  for example remembering which words are commonly used together.

It's solutions have huge ramifications for everyday life. From the book
""On the plus side, though, we might be able to develop fast algorithms to solve all sorts of logistical problems. Factories could schedule tasks to operate at maximum efficiency and delivery companies could find efficient routes to transport their packages, potentially bringing down the price of goods – even if we could no longer safely order them online! In the scientific realm, proving P equals NP might provide efficient methods for computer vision, genetic sequencing and even the prediction of natural disasters.
Ironically, although science may be a big winner if P equals NP, scientists themselves may be the biggest losers. Some of the most astounding scientific discoveries have relied enormously on the creative thinking of highly trained and dedicated individuals, embedded deeply in their fields: Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s last theorem, Einstein’s theory of general relativity, Newton’s equations of motion. If P equals NP, then computers would be able to find formal proofs of any mathematical theorem that is provable – many of the greatest intellectual achievements of humankind might be reproduced and superseded by the work of a robot. A lot of mathematicians would be out of a job. At its heart, it seems, P vs NP is the battle to discover whether human creativity can be automated.

First, your thinking  is mostly correct that ""higher-level"" languages (interpreted languages,  languages with complex runtimes or, etc.) typically run slower than  compiled languages. There's a lot of discussion that could be had around  that statement, and it certainly comes with caveats and exceptions, but  in general it's true. However, in this case, C++ and Rust are both  compiled languages, and so rewriting an application in Rust would not  see much change in performance (assuming the application is written as  similarly as possible, in other words, a port to Rust's syntax without  use of the unique nuances of the language that are not present in C++).

However,  Rust has some features that typically makes it an easier language for  writing memory-safe applications compared to C++. So, taking advantage  of these features can make it easier for a programmer to make certain  applications faster in Rust compared to C++ (it's still doable in C++,  but requires more complexity in the programming techniques used).

But  the key thing here is to look at what Brave actually did. They weren't  just rewriting the existing adblocking algorithm in a different  language. They were making fundamental changes to the algorithm itself,  changes that were easier to program by switching to a new language.  These algorithmic changes are where the real performance gains were  realized.

The change is detailed  in this blog post, but I'll give a brief explanation (EDIT: the link  appears to be blacklisted by Reddit, so just copy/paste the URL into  your address bar): brave.com/improved-ad-blocker-performance/

Essentially,  an adblocker works by matching URLs against a list of patterns. If the  URL matches any of these patterns, it is blocked. The lists are very  long, and the patterns can be quite complex, so the adblocker attempts  to optimize how it does its matching. In Brave's old implementation,  they used the assumption that most requests will not be blocked to  optimize their algorithm. However, after some experimenting, they found  that about 39% of real-world URL requests are blocked, which was more  than they expected. So they restructured their algorithm with this in  mind. This time, instead of assuming that most \*URLs\* will not match any  patterns, they make the assumption that most \*patterns\* will not match a  URL (even though there is likely some pattern that matches the URL).  They then go on to group patterns by likelihood, and use a further  tokenization technique on the patterns for faster matching. If you're  interested in the details, I highly recommend the blog post I linked  above.",1569440937,{},f1fblrw,False,t3_d69wpz,False,True,t3_d69wpz,/r/askscience/comments/d69wpz/since_all_code_is_eventually_translated_into/f1fblrw/,1569440938.0,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There can be many possible correct answers, but if the function is one-way, then it should be intractable to find any of those correct answers (except by exhaustive search).

[],SkeletonRuined,,,[],,,,text,t2_7six94j,False,,"A one-way hash is a function which is easy to calculate forwards, but difficult to invert.

For example, SHA256 is conjectured to be a one-way hash function. An easy way to see the SHA256 hash of any string is to use an online calculator like this one: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html

If you have an input, say 'flopdood', then you can easily put that in and see the hash: 4cd4aee8ae42396f7b226fb1be20ff839778afb29ea05200c7f3e69d2cdd0104

But, if I give you a hash output, can you find the input?

One strategy to reverse a hash is to just guess inputs until you find one that gives you the desired output. This strategy always works, but if the input was random, then it's pretty inefficient. If you wanted to invert a random SHA256 output with this strategy, it would take basically forever. See this video for an illustration of how much time this would take: https://youtu.be/S9JGmA5_unY

If you happen to have a good idea of what the input should be, then you can invert the hash much more easily. For example, if you see a hash output of 'ae42396f7b226fb1be20ff839778afb29ea05200c7f3e69d2cdd0104', then you know the input was 'flopdood', since I showed you the other direction earlier in this comment. But if you have no idea what the input is, then you're stuck making random guesses.

But what if there's some clever algorithm that lets you calculate the inverse of a hash faster than just randomly guessing inputs? Then that hash function is not one-way!

We don't know for sure that SHA256 is one-way. But so far, no one has publicly inverted a random SHA256 output. Bitcoin actually relies on SHA256 being a one-way function in a few ways, so if someone did know an algorithm to invert it, they might be able to get free money. SHA256 is also used in HTTPS encryption (over which people send bank details, etc). Since there are monetary incentives for people to break these, and we haven't seen anyone break them, it gives some confidence that they aren't broken. But it's not for certain.

In fact, there is *no* function so far that has been proven to be one-way. The existence of one-way functions is still an open question in computability theory. It might be the case that no function is one-way. (For example, if P=NP, then one-way functions cannot exist. If P!=NP, then maybe one-way functions exist, but it's also possible that P!=NP and there are still no one-way functions.)

[],ICanBeAnAssholeToo,,,[],,,,text,t2_3pvn2jwc,False,,"Basically to map a genome (more correctly known as genome sequencing), you take the dna, fragment it into many pieces, sequence each piece separately (which is to decide the sequence of dna) and then try to piece together the whole genome again. This is done because sequencing cannot be done for more than roughly 1000 bases at a time, hence the need to fragment the genome. 

So the question comes, how do we know which fragment comes after which? We repeat the fragmenting and sequencing of the dna again. As fragmenting the dna is a random process, the dna breaks at different places each time. Now, after we sequence the second round of fragments, we can find overlaps of fragments when we compare both sets of fragments. This serves as a guide to piece everything up together again. 

As an example: the whole dna is:

Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are.

I can break it up into fragments:

- Twinkle, twinkle, 

- little star, How I wonder what 

- you are. Up above the world so high, Like a

- diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle

- little star, How I wonder

- what you are.

How do I know what’s the order to put them in? I fragment it again: 

- Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I 

- wonder what you are. Up above the 

- world so high, 

- Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, 

-twinkle, little star, How I wonder 

-what you are.

Here you can see in set 1, the line “you are. Up above the world so high, Like a” over laps the fragments “wonder what you are. Up above the”, “world so high,” and “Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle,”. We we now know that the fragments can be pieced that way and we know what comes after “like a” because it’s in the fragment from set 2. We also know what comes before “you are” in set 1’s fragments, as set 2’s fragment tells us it’s “wonder what”

So this is the basic process. The new technologies use the same process, except that We just have improved the technology that allows us to automate this process and make millions of sets of fragments that run the same time. This brings costs and time spent down. Piecing then together is also done by a computer running an algorithm. 

The problem arises when there’s a part of our DNA that is basically repeats, for example “twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle” etc. it is hard for us to determine exactly how many of these repeats are there using this method, so dna sequencing is never 100% complete.",1566834746,{},ey5lr1t,False,t3_cvmi2d,False,True,t1_ey53zf8,/r/askscience/comments/cvmi2d/askscience_ama_series_im_dr_paul_knoepfler_stem/ey5lr1t/,1566834748.0,1,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relays can be used to implement any logic function, but at first they were just used for extremely basic functions.  One such function was as ""repeaters"" to simply repeat a received telegraph signal from one segment of line into the next line, to increase the distance a signal could be sent.

It's hard to pin down the point at which algorithms were first implemented per se on electrical hardware, partly because early computing hardware was largely mechanical. 
[Punch cards, originally used for controlling weaving looms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card#History), were one part of that story, and calculators that used mechanical mechanisms to do the calculations (to carry out algorithms for computation), driven by cranks or electric motors were [another part of the story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware#Calculators).

[Electromechanical computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware#Electromechanical_computers) using relays gradually became more and more sophisticated and were used through WWII to implement rather sophisticated algorithms.

[],katinla,,eng,[],,Radiation Protection | Space Environments,dark,text,t2_fwp4z,False,,"It's not that simple, actually. Finding a specific index in an array works in constant time, that's right, but finding a specific entry in a filesystem isn't at all like accessing the array's nth element.

Since you mentioned size-dependent time I'm going to assume you have some basic knowledge of data structures, and algorithm efficiency in terms of the ""big Oh notation"". Please let me know if you want me to expand on a particular concept.

A filename is a string. Matching a filename to an entry in the filesystem requires a data structure that can use strings as keys. In an ideal world you would be able to convert a string directly into an array subindex with a simple arithmetical calculation, and then you would only access that particular cell in constant time. This data structure is called direct mapping and the ""simple arithmetical calculation"" is usually called enumeration function (it can be seen as an extreme case of a hashtable in which the hash function is guaranteed not to produce any collisions). It's the best data structure in terms of time, but it carries significant disadvantages in terms of space, especially if the set of possible keys is too big: the array becomes too big and most cells are unused. This is exactly what's happening if you use strings as keys: if you try to define an enumeration function for strings you'll see the image of the function (in mathematical terms) becomes an immense set. So the array that you'd need for filenames would take up the whole space of your disk or more, and you'd have nothing left for file contents.

(Direct mapping is still a beautiful data structure in the very few cases in which your set of keys is small and enumerable.)

So you need a more space efficient data structure. This will inevitably impact search time (as well as creation and deletion time).

The second design consideration when choosing a data structure for a filesystem is that, unlike RAM, the disk is read *by sectors*. In order to read a single byte from disk the OS needs to request the read of a whole sector which is usually 512 bytes. Since you have some basic knowledge of data structures you'll know that most search algorithms make very sparse memory accesses (e.g. binary search jumps to the middle of an array, then to the quarter, than to the eighth, etc). It'd really be a waste of disk access time if you request a whole sector each time.

So there are a couple of data structures that are optimized (or can be optimized) for disk: B-trees and hash tables. The principle of optimization is clustering search keys so that if one has been read, then the ones adjacent to it are very likely to be read next. This will significantly reduce the number of times the OS has to request a sector from the disk.

Hashtables are easy to optimize for this by increasing the number of slots in a bucket until the bucket size in bytes is as big as you can fit in a sector. So the hash function tells you to read bucket N, then you request a single sector from disk and read several keys in it.

B trees are similar to binary trees, except that a node can have N keys and N+1 descendants instead of 2. (You can think of a binary tree as a special case of B tree in which N=1). The search algorithm is: compare the search key to the ith key, if it's smaller follow the pointer at the left of i, if bigger increase i and iterate, fail if you hit the end of the node. Same principle here: choose N so that the node size fits the sector size as closely as possible.

Whether the filesystem uses hashtables or B trees will depend on the OS and filesystem type (ext4, FAT, NTFS, etc.). I'm not aware of the specifics of all of them, but Linux ext4 tries to combine the advantages of hashtables and B trees in a structure they call ""hashed B tree"". [https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4\_Disk\_Layout#Hash\_Tree\_Directories](https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout#Hash_Tree_Directories)

So you know, the search time in a B-tree is logarithmic, hash tables are a bit more complicated as it depends a lot on the efficiency of the hash function and load factor.

Last thing to consider: a filesystem isn't a single data structure. Each directory is a data structure mapping filenames to entries (which can be either files or directories themselves, hence the algorithm is recursive). Searching for something like ""c:\\users\\katinla\\Documents\\images"" would first search the root for a directory named ""users"", then that directory for ""katinla"", etc. That increases the search time.

Buuuut...... the use case you mentioned:

&gt;I want to find a file I KNOW I have on my computer, but don't know where it is.

is making things a lot worse. You have to search a data structure but you don't know *which* data structure to search. So the OS has to enumerate all keys in the root directory, then for each of them 1) search for the file and, if it's not found, 2) descend into subdirectories and repeat.

It's inevitably going to take a lot of time.

(Writing this post made me think, this particular use case could be optimized if you put a central data structure matching filenames to directories containing them. It would yield a *set* of directories as output since the same filename in different directories is allowed. But I don't know if any filesystems implement something like this, and I don't think they will because space requirements would be too big).",1565557329,{},ewmpio2,False,t3_cp0n4p,False,True,t3_cp0n4p,/r/askscience/comments/cp0n4p/since_simple_computer_functions_especially/ewmpio2/,1565557330.0,1,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],functor7,,maths,[],,Number Theory,dark,text,t2_4nrp2,False,,"There is a proof.

It's important to note that something like ""261"" is really just shorthand for an actual mathematical expression: 2\*10^(2) + 6\*10 +1. Almost anything that has to do with a digit representations of number (eg: why does multiplication algorithm we learn in 3rd grade work?) can be resolved upon realizing that decimal representations are really nothing more than convenient ways to write numbers down.

In our case, note that any power of 10 is exactly one more than a multiple of 9. In particular:

* 10 = 9 + 1
* 10^(2) = 99 + 1
* 10^(3) = 999 + 1
* 10^(4) = 9999 + 1
* etc

So if we have a number, like 261, then we can write it as

* 261 = 2\*10^(2) + 6\*10 +1 = 2\*99 + 6\*9 + (2 + 6 + 1) = (MULTIPLE OF 9) + 2+6+1

Because 9 is already divisible by 3, the only way that 261 itself can be divisible by 3 is if 2+6+1 is divisible by 3. This result is actually stronger. If N is a number, then the sum of its digits is called its ""Digital Sum"", which we'll denote by n. From the same reasoning as with 261, write all the powers of 10 as one more than some number that is just 9s repeated, we can write 

* N = (MULTIPLE OF 9) + n

This means that, no matter the number, N-n will *always* be a multiple of 9. That is, the difference between a number and its digital sum is always a multiple of 3.

In 1931 Gödel then proofed that finding such a system of axioms is not possible and that there will always be undecidable problems. To cite from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems):

* ""The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency."" *

To now get to the ""realm of standard mathematics"" - normally we take here the system [ZFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory), the Zermelo-Franklin-theory with the axiom of choice (AC) included. Now one could take for example the Zermelo-Franklin-theory without the AC and ask, if the AC can be proven by using the other axioms. And I can not give you the proof for that, but it can be shown that the AC is undecidable in the Zermelo-Franklin-theory...

Possibly more computing time than all of the computers yet devised by man could compute before the end of the universe.

That depends.  As I alluded to briefly in one of my footnotes, proofs can be either _constructive_ or _non-constructive_.  A _constructive_ proof would by necessity provide a way to convert all (or some subset) of NP problems into P problems.  What you seem to be thinking about is a _non-constructive_ proof, where you can reason about the problem without providing a concrete example or algorithm.  Likely, a proof that P ≠ NP would be non-constructive (for example).

There is a subset of NP problems I didn't mention, which are the [NP Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) problems.  These are problems in class NP where we already have proofs that any problem in the NP Complete problem set can be re-described in terms of any _other_ NP Compete problem.  Many of these problems are fairly easy to conceptualize -- for example, [Boolean Satisfiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem), and are very likely candidates is a _constructive_ proof of P = NP is ever devised.  As any problem in NP Complete can be expressed in terms of any other problem in NP Complete, if you find a constructive solution for one, you find a constructive solution for _all_ NP Complete problems.

As a side note, the computer on your desk likely has non-deterministic aspects to it already.  While most problems run deterministically most of the time, there are non-deterministic aspects available that can impact computation.  For example, if your computer has a hardware Random Number Generator, this can introduce non-determinism.  As well, if you're running a multi-core machine, then timing between cores can also introduce a level of non-determinism.  User input can also induce non-determinism (depending on whether not not the machine makes _decisions_ based on the input).

(Also you must show that there is another algorithm for any NP-C problem that uses the initial algorithm as it's black box, to ensure it's equivalent and not strictly harder to solve).

In this way, discovering a poly-time algorithm for any NP-C problem will automatically give us poly-time algorithms for every other NP-C problem just by plugging it in to the existing theoretical algorithms as the black box. However, these theoretical algorithms are often not particularly efficient, and it gets worse if you have to do several layers of these black box plugins (because AFAIK there has not been discovered a direct conversion between every pair of NP-C problems).

[],YaztromoX,,computing,[],,Systems Software,dark,text,t2_ngsr1,False,,"In Computer Science, we like to quantify algorithms based on how their running time is affected as the input size grows.  Some algorithms run at the exact same speed regardless of input size, while others become significantly more complicated much quicker as the input size increases.  By way of an example of an easy case is pulling a value out of an array -- it doesn't matter if we ask for array item 2 or array item 29 756, the speed of doing so is constant.  A more complicated case would be something like chess -- we can calculate all possible moves on a smaller chess board, but as the board gets bigger we get into a situation where calculating all possible games would require every computer mankind ever manufactured to date to run until the heat death of the universe...and it still wouldn't complete.

So we have a notation for describing an algorithms runtime complexity ([Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), and we can put problems with similar runtime constraints into a _complexity class_.  And there are two very important complexity classes called 'P'  and 'NP' that many algorithms fit into^0.  

Algorithms that are part of 'P' have two important characteristics: the time they take to run can be described as a polynomial (that is, by an equation of the form ""an^k + bn^k-1 + cn^k-2...+xn^2 + yn +z""^1), and the time required to verify the solution can also be described as a polynomial.

Algorithms that are part of 'NP' also have a similar pair of characteristics.  Like problems in 'P', the solutions can be verified in polynomial time.  However, their runtime to calculate the solution in the first place only runs in polynomial time on a _non-deterministic_ Turing machine, which may be worse than polynomial time when run on a _deterministic_ Turing machine^2.  You don't have to worry about the details of what that means -- but generally it means that these are problems where we can verify the result in polynomial time (or ""poly time"" for short), but where the computation itself may not be computable in poly time.

Using the above definitions, it's not hard to see that every problem in P is also in NP.  If you were to draw a Venn diagram, P would be a circle entirely inside NP.  All P problems can be verified in polynomial time, and all of their runtimes can be run in poly time on a non-deterministic Turing machine (as well as running in poly time in a completely deterministic Turing machine).

So here is where the unsolved equation comes in:  we know that P is inside NP.  However, is P = NP?  That is, can _every_ problem in NP be reformulated such that it would also be in P?  Or are there problems in NP that can't be reformulated to also be in P?

This has been an open question in computer science for much of the past century, and currently there is no proof either way.  Many computer scientists _believe_ that P ≠ NP, but there is no actual proof one way or another (on a side note, some feel that P = NP, however some in that camp feel that any conversion of a NP problem into P would be non-constructive^5).

Okay -- so what is the point of all this über-nerd gobbledygook?  It reads like a whole bunch of mental masturbation for eggheads -- is this important in the real world?

The answer to that decision problems is a big YES.  Some extremely important algorithms that people rely upon in their daily lives currently rely on the assumption that P ≠ NP.  One of the most important of these is _encryption_.  Decryption can be thought of as a decision problem -- given an input (the encrypted data), we can quickly verify if our ""solution"" is correct (that is, did the decryption work?  Did we get the right decrypted data back?).  But how useful would decryption be if we could also decrypt _any_ data (without the decryption key) in polynomial time on any computer?  What would happen if it was also very easy to decrypt any encrypted information without a password or encryption key?  Right now the whole contract of encryption is that it is very easy to decrypt data if you have the proper encryption key, but that without the encryption key decrypting the data is more difficult, and gets more and more difficult as the key size increases.  Decrypting data with a 2048 bit key would require more time in the average case than the expected lifetime of our solar system.  Proving that P = NP, and then finding a constructive solution to convert an NP decryption algorithm such that it is also in P would likely break the way we encrypt data.  This could have serious repercussions to how virtually all commerce and personal privacy on Earth works.^6

At the same time, it could make a lot of problems that are very difficult to solve computationally more efficient.  This could have all sorts of positive benefits (that outweigh the negatives of breaking encryption).  The Knapsack problem^7, for example, is in NP and is thus more and more difficult to solve as the number of items you could potentially put into the knapsack increases.  But if we had an efficient way to convert this problem such that it was also in P it would potentially have all sorts of positive benefits in the real world^9.  All of the world shipping logistics for example could be significantly improved -- the Knapsack Problem isn't any different than figuring out what sets of items to pack into a shipping container to maximize the weight and number of items being shipped -- companies that were able to efficiently compute this for each cargo container, and for each ship (as you can think of assigning containers to ships as an instance of the Knapsack Problem as well!).

This problem is so important that is it one of the seven [Millennium Prize Problems](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems).  I'd also argue that it's the most important problem, as if you could solve it and prove that P = NP, [it may mean that a computer could generate proofs for all of the other Millennium Prize Problems](http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/pvsnp.pdf)^10.  So if you can solve this one, you _might_ also be able to efficiently solve all of the _other_ major mathematical problems of our time.

How cool would _that_ be?  HTH!

^0 -- 'P' and 'NP' problems are formulated as _decision problems_, that is problems where the result is YES or NO.  Conceivably, we can generally take problems and convert it into a decision problem -- a sort algorithm, for example, may be reformulated as a sorting algorithm where at the end we ask ""Is this list sorted?"", and we get back a YES or NO response.  I'm trying to keep things somewhat simple to understand for laypeople, so I'm not going to deal with these specifics in this post.  
^1 -- I would have preferred to use the same letter for the term multipliers with subscripts, but AFAIK Reddit doesn't permit subscripts, only superscripts.  So please don't take my use of a, b, c, x, y, and z to imply that there are only 26 terms in the polynomial form.  There could be just one, or there could be thousands.  
^2 -- Ugh, I've been trying to reformulate a way to discuss this without getting into the differences between deterministic and non-deterministic machines, or what a Turing machine is^3.  The simplest explanation is that the computers we run are all like deterministic Turing machines^4; a non-deterministic Turing machine is one that you can think of is allowed to ""guess"" at answers.  
^3 -- at its simplest, it's a simple mathematical model of a computer used to prove what computers can do, and what they can't do.  
^4 -- You can think of ""deterministic"" to mean that given a series of instructions, the machine will runt he instructions one at a time, and won't just decide to go and do its own thing once in a while.  
^5 -- a [_non-constructive proof_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof#Non-constructive_proofs) is one that doesn't create or provide an actual object to demonstrate the proof.  So in this case, it would be a proof that doesn't actually show _how_ to convert a problem from NP into P, and which doesn't provide an example of converting a problem in NP to also be in P.  
^6 -- There are some conditions here.  I've been somewhat hand-wavy concerning some of the specifics of the runtime constraints for a poly time algorithm.  Most people wind up thinking that ""poly time"" means _fast_, and everything else means _slow_.  That isn't necessarily the case -- n^10 is polynomial, and has worse runtime characteristics than an algorithm that runs in exponential time of 2^n (for n&gt;~1.07755 that is, and since n is generally considered to be an integer value, you can say this is true for an n &gt; 1).  However, algorithms that have such massive poly time exponentials are pretty rare, so we don't run into cases like this very often.  So while not a universal truth, in most _known_ cases problems in P run faster than problems in NP that are not also in P.  
^7 -- the Knapsack Problem is pretty easy to visualize.  Say you have a knapsack, and a bunch of items of different weights^8.  The Knapsack Problem asks:  which items should you pack such that you get closest to some fixed maximum weight value?  
^8 -- you can also think of items with different volumes if you prefer.  In fact, a multi-dimensional Knapsack problem could look at both the volume and mass of the items, as well as potentially other factors (such as their monetary value).  
^9 -- other than being very useful for your next camping trip.

[],EZ-PEAS,,,[],,,,text,t2_snpmb7k,False,,"It usually does not. Most of the classical game theory results assume you have rational players acting optimally. For example, [zero-sum games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) assume that any player's gain is exactly offset by losses from other players. Such games have been comprehensively studied and solved through the [minimax theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium).

But, you are certainly not the first to observe that most players in real-life do not always act optimally or rationally. 

One of the easiest such extensions for such behavior is a modification of the minimax algorithm cited above, called [expectimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectiminimax). In traditional minimax you assume that players play optimally. In expectimax you assign some probability to each of your opponent's possible actions, and each action has some associated utility gain or loss. Instead of picking the action that maximizes the minimum gain (minimax) you pick the action that maximizes the expected gain. This makes it possible to exploit an opponent that is highly likely to pick sub-optimal actions.

But, consider that in a real sense terms such as ""irrational actor"" only make sense in traditional zero-sum games with optimal play. In a sense, much of the work that has been done on non-zero-sum games or cooperative games may also be applicable to ""irrational actors."" For example, in a non-zero-sum game it's possible that a player may have a choice between one action that improves their utility and another choice between improving everyone's utility. Is it irrational to improve everyone's utility if it costs you nothing? Moreover, is it irrational to allow other players to have a major gain in utility if it costs you only very little? If you met such a player living their life in such a manner on the street you'd probably call them a ""nice person"" instead of an ""irrational actor."" 

Fundamentally, many modern AI approaches either include or work around the presence of irrational actors. For example, learning algorithms have the goal of learning what actions lead to higher reward, so the actions of other players are implicitly considered but not explicitly considered. One of the earliest learning algorithms called [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) is one such algorithm. The approach here is that a player will try some action and record their utility gain/loss. Over time they will learn what actions lead to what outcomes and in what situations. Here, the presence of irrational actors is implicit insofar as they modify the reward that you get from actions. A Q-learning agent that plays against irrational actors will learn different strategies than an agent that plays against optimal actors, and such an agent can even adapt their strategy over time through the ""learning rate"" parameter to account for irrational actors coming in and out of the game.",1564876727,{},evwyct5,False,t3_cli9ad,False,True,t3_cli9ad,/r/askscience/comments/cli9ad/in_what_ways_does_game_theory_account_for/evwyct5/,1564876728.0,1,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],antonivs,,,[],,,,text,t2_1orgu,False,,"I think some of that doesn't make much difference. It's certainly possible that our minds could be limited. But we don't have to be able to comprehend all possible mathematics - in fact it's almost certainly the case that we can't, perhaps even demonstrably so.

I was saying that the mathematical propositions that we *can* understand and prove, as far as we can tell, should be true in any universe.

We can caveat and quibble about that - what if the target universe can't represent math, doesn't have any matter, etc. But these caveats can easily be countered - we can just say ""in any universe that's not unreasonably restricted,"" etc. I don't see that as a particularly significant exception.

Of course it's possible that our understanding of math is fundamentally compromised and we live in a universe that, either by accident or design, supports our misunderstanding - in which case what we think we know wouldn't apply in other, less messed-up universes. But that's not the null hypothesis. It just seems like another not particularly significant edge case.

&gt; If a computer proves or disproves a mathematical proposition that its user cannot understand, even in theory, was anything proven to begin with?

It depends what you know about the process. For example, one might be able to prove that its proof is correct - for example, if it is done by construction following an algorithm simple enough to understand and verify. In that case, you can know something was proven.

The four color map theorem proof is somewhat along these lines. It took a thousand hours of computer time (in the 1970s), and the results were claimed to be a proof. But later investigation found multiple errors, which were subsequently corrected. This is a case of ""garbage in, garbage out"". The problem is you may not know whether you fed garbage in unless you're able to detect the garbage output - and that may be impractical in some cases. So the answer could be ""we can't be sure that anything was proven.""

On the other hand, almost no knowledge is absolute, and proofs can provide more confidence in the truth of some proposition, even if they contain errors. Even though the original 4-color map theorem proof contained errors, we still think the proposition is almost certainly true. The proof helped to increase confidence by virtue of the fact that it didn't uncover any violations of the proposition. This is more like science than math: science often can't prove things, only increase our confidence that they're correct.

To use that example, even if we only have high confidence that you only need four colors for a map, it means we can say with high confidence that this would be true in any universe where it is possible to draw, or even just imagine, two-dimensional colored maps. 

I don't see a *serious* alternative to this - to substantiate a claim to the contrary, you'd need to show how it could be possible for the exact same formal system to produce different results in a different universe.

[],WAGUSTIN,,,[],,,,text,t2_te448,False,,"You're right, yes, the brain is very, very different from how computers perform computation, and that includes how standard neural networks perform computation. Commercial computers use the Von Neumann architecture, that is, they shuttle information between the CPU and main memory. In the brain, every neuron can store memory and perform computation. The brain also, as you say, performs computation massively in parallel, which neural networks are not quite capable of doing. Parallelism is sort of implemented in neural networks by chucking the neural network at a GPU or multiple CPUs/GPUs, but the layers of a neural network still have to be evaluated in order, and then backpropagation happens, again, in order of layers (in reverse). Another difference is that neurons in the brain send signals with ""spikes,"" as in, they excite, and then send that excitation signal, and then turn back off. There is not really a sense of this in neural networks, since there is not so much of a time component in neural networks. Relatedly, one last major difference is that neurons in neural networks don't have a time component. That is to say, neurons firing and exciting the next neuron happens pretty much immediately, and latency is completely limited by how fast the layers are computed. You can create neural networks that have some sort of time dependence, but the implementations are sort of unnatural, even if they work, like sharpening the edge of a spoon to cut meat.

Neurons in a neuromorphic computer are all in massive parallel (typically in a grid-like arrangement when you look at the hardware), and each neuron acts as both memory and a contributor to computation. You can train this network with a genetic algorithm, with ""fitness"" being defined in terms of performance (say, how high of a score it gets in a game of Asteroids), and then run it.

Neuromorphic computers are an exciting new field because a major advantage they have over neural networks on our everyday computers is that they save a huge amount of power.

For example, consider [this graph](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/#graph%20G%20%7B%0A%20%20concentrate%3Dtrue%3B%0A%20%20A%20--%20B%3B%0A%20%20A%20--%20C%3B%0A%20%20B%20--%20C%3B%0A%20%20B%20--%20D%3B%0A%20%20C%20--%20E%3B%0A%20%20D%20--%20E%3B%0A%20%20D%20--%20F%3B%0A%20%20E%20--%20F%3B%0A%20%20B%20--%20F%3B%0A%20%20C%20--%20F%3B%0A%20%20Z%3B%0A%0A%20%20%7Brank%20%3D%20same%3B%20B%3B%20C%3B%7D%0A%20%20%7Brank%20%3D%20same%3B%20D%3B%20E%3B%7D%0A%7D). If I want to connect Z to A, D, and E, there is nowhere I can put Z that will not result in crossing some edge. But the problem isn't that this graph is non-planar, it's that I need to move some of the other parts around; for example, if I move A and Z inside the cycle B-C-E-D it is clear that the graph is still planar with the addition of edges from Z to A, D, and E.

One way we can tell that OPs graph is non-planar is because it contains as a subgraph a subdivision of K_{3,3}.

[],annitaq,,,[],,,,text,t2_ze2r2,False,,"Very roughly, video compression works by storing only the differences between a frame and the successive one. The basic assumption here is that if a character moves on a fixed background, then most pixels will be exactly the same. You can divide the image into rectangles of e.g. 10x10 pixels, and compare each rectangle to its equivalent in the successive image. If they are equal, don't store any data (and here is where quality loss algorithms kick in: if they are *very similar*, they neglect the differences and don't store any data).

This is in addition to compressing the image itself. You'll notice a jpeg file also doesn't follow your calculations (in fact, i believe the math you did will only work for the BMP format which is uncompressed - just add a few bytes for the file header). PCX compression roughly works this way: if N successive pixels have the same colour, then store a special value (first two bits on if I remember correctly) which means ""repeat this pixel N times"". You'll notice, if you take a BMP image and save it as PCX, that the file size is reduced a bit this way. This kind of compression works better for simple images with uniform colors (e.g. diagrams, screenshots) and not so much for pictures, and PCX has a very rudimentary algorithm. JPEG has a lossy compression neglecting very similar colors, so it can compress much more.

So, JPEG compression for each frame plus storing only differences between successive frames gives a fairly good compression for video.

This is greatly oversimplified, of course.

While computers are typically binary, we often use hexadecimal (base-16) notation to represent the binary data for the sake of compactness.  Every four binary digits is equivalent to exactly one hexadecimal digit.  The UTF-8 coding of the letter 'A' in binary is 0100 0001, or ""41"" in hexadecimal^0,^1.  Each grouping of four binary digits is equivalent to exactly one hexadecimal digit^2.

In computing we also have an algorithm known as Base64, which is a mechanism to represent six binary digits as a single printable digit (generally including all the values 0-9, A-Z, a-z, and + and /).  The purpose for this is to be able to convert arbitrary binary data into only printable characters, so as to get around older programs and hardware that could only handle 7-bit printable characters (as was still somewhat common in the early Internet).  E-mail attachments for example are re-encoded into Base64 for transmission.

As for your question concerning constants, [here is a page that has expansions of pi in ten different numerical basis](http://turner.faculty.swau.edu/mathematics/materialslibrary/pi/pibases.html).  Calculations in physics and such generally are agnostic to the numeric base in use; so long as you use the same base consistently, you'll get valid results.  The base is more a matter of convention -- and while on paper physicists may do calculations in the common base 10, as soon as computers are involved those calculations are typically done in base 2.

Finally, the reason why you've likely never read about ""a dozen dozen"" is because (in English at least) there is a word for this:  one dozen dozen is a [_gross_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gross#Noun).

If you are interested in the variety of uses for various different numeric bases, [Wikipedia has a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numeral_systems) that includes both numeric systems used by different historical cultures, and systems used in computing for various tasks.

One method works like this: Basically, you give them some inputs (eg x, y and z) and they then generate a new set of numbers (some of which are used as inputs to generate the set set next time you ask for a random number)

They then cycle through an enormous set of random seeming numbers before finally cycling back around to the first set.

Here is an example of a very simple early method for generating pseudo random numbers:

An early computer-based PRNG, suggested by John von Neumann in 1946, is known as the middle-square method. The algorithm is as follows: take any number, square it, remove the middle digits of the resulting number as the ""random number"", then use that number as the seed for the next iteration. For example, squaring the number ""1111"" yields ""1234321"", which can be written as ""01234321"", an 8-digit number being the square of a 4-digit number. This gives ""2343"" as the ""random"" number. Repeating this procedure gives ""4896"" as the next result, and so on. Von Neumann used 10 digit numbers, but the process was the same.

A problem with the ""middle square"" method is that all sequences eventually repeat themselves, some very quickly, such as ""0000"". Von Neumann was aware of this, but he found the approach sufficient for his purposes, and was worried that mathematical ""fixes"" would simply hide errors rather than remove them.

* The cryptographic approach, where the criterion is that, as long as a parameter called the *seed* is chosen at random and secretly, no algorithm can tell the output apart from a true random sequence *in a reasonable amount of time*.
* The weaker approach, where you define a list of specific statistical tests that pseudorandom numbers should pass that's reasonable for applications of interest (e.g., physical simulations) and insist that the algorithm need only pass these.

As an example, choose a number x between 0 and 1 and then iterate 4x(1-x) repeatedly (four times x times one minus x). Its a bad prng and no one would use it but it illustrates how this works. The main feature is that the numbers grow (the 4x part) but get wrapped back onto the interval (the (1-x) part). Many prng algorithms use a modulo operation to wrap the numbers.

Another way to think of it is if you moved the clock hand around the dial (wrapping) in fixed increments but in such a way that each jump just misses the last position when you come back around.

[],Amanoo,,,[],,,,text,t2_af4nn,False,,"There are many different techniques, depending on the software used. But almost all boil down to one idea: you provide a so-called seed, which is some piece of data that has some sort of randomness to it. This can vary a lot, depending on your hardware platform, operating system, or even the programming language that is used. There is then some sort of algorithm, basically a mathematical formula, which uses this seed as its inputs and produces a seemingly random number as the output. Basically, you have some formule like f(x)=*some formula here*, with x being your seed, and the formula being some bit of math that can have widely variable outputs, even if x changes only a little. The exact form of this formula can also vary a lot, depending on hardware used, operating system, and programming language.


There are various tactics for obtaining such a seed. Some user software may use random input factors. For example, user input like keystrokes (or the timing thereof) or mouse movements. Data from this is then fed into the randomiser algorithm. Your phone may use data from the accelerometer or other sensors to do this. There are also companies that provide their own cryptography services and have built their own randomisers. [Cloudfare continuously films lava lamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cUUfMeOijg), and produces random numbers based on those. Other software purely depends on whatever randomness is present in the computer's hardware. I believe the real time clock is often used, which is then put in the randomiser algorithm, but this is not a very good method and should only be used for software that doesn't need a high level of security.

Basically, there are all sorts of tactics. It really depends on the hardware of the specific computer, the algorithm used , the operating system, the programming language, and even then there may be a special piece of engineering for systems that need some extra security.",1563140933,{},etsazzz,False,t3_cd6rdg,False,True,t3_cd6rdg,/r/askscience/comments/cd6rdg/how_do_computers_simulate_randomness/etsazzz/,1563140934.0,7,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,1563227333.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What's no so well known is that there's some fairly advanced math involved in testing for pseudo-randomness, and that testing randomness is a discipline in its own right. 

This is a big deal in crypto, because *any* form of predictability is very bad for security. And all the different PRNG algos have slightly different statistical characteristics.

Of course if you know the algo being used, and the seed, you've broken the encryption. But if you don't start with that information, you can still use a variety of attacks to try to guess the algorithm and work out where you are in the PRNG sequence.

Yes, if you are talking about base clock that is correct as far as I understand.

[],mofo69extreme,,physics,[],,Condensed Matter Theory,dark,text,t2_e8rdr,False,[],"&gt; The commutation relations between spin observables are derived in terms of the canonical commutation relations of linear position and momentum.

In some sense, this is just one way to derive those relations. But more abstractly, you can say that any Hamiltonian which has some transformations with the structure of 3D rotations (the SO(3)) that leave it invariant will lead to the same su(2) algebra when one considers infinitesimal transformations. for example, one could start with some randomly-given finite dimensional matrix, and by playing with it, discover a set of matrices which leave it invariant under conjugation which happen to span SO(3).

Now, once you have a symmetry in a quantum system, you immediately can use [Wigner's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_theorem). This says that, once your Hamiltonian is invariant under a symmetry group G, then you can choose the eigenstates of the system to transform under irreducible *projective* representations of G. Here, the work ""projective"" means that the states can transform irreducibly up to an overall phase - after all, such phases are unobservable in quantum physics, so these phases can show up.

Now there's a bunch of formal math with how to construct these. For our case at hand, I'll say that since the Lie algebra of SO(3) (which is su(2)) does not admit a ""central extension,"" then it happens that if we simply find all of the irreducible representations of the group given by exponentiating su(2) (so SU(2)), then we automatically get all of the faithful and projective representations of SO(3). This is not a trivial step so I can go into more detail here if you like.

Now, it happens that the even-dimensional irreps of SU(2) are the projective ones (we call them spinors by convention), while the odd-dimensional ones are faithful SO(3) irreps. Nothing says that one **needs** to have spinors once we have an SO(3) symmetry - there are plenty of quantum systems with SO(3) symmetry without spinor reps - but there are systems in nature which take advantage of the fact that they are allowed to show up in rotationally-invariant systems.",1569789618,{},f1wugre,False,t3_d9iuh2,False,True,t3_d9iuh2,/r/askscience/comments/d9iuh2/why_do_we_need_spinors/f1wugre/,1569798255.0,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Desktop Intel CPUs have a clock, and a clock multiplier (Since around some model of the 486). In general the clock is ""fixed"" (often adjustable to some degree in the bios/uefi, or ""back in the day"" via jumpers/switches), Intel's  specification calls for a 100Mhz reference clock speed (not sure for AMD these days). The multiplier is controlled by the CPU (and the os can over-ride it to some degree), and there are constant evaluations made on what the current multiplier is, based on load, heat, power draw, and other limits both changeable and not. 

The base clock is then used for all of the other core components, the memory bus, PCIe bus, the interconnect to the chipset. The memory bus has its own multiplier, which normally gets automatically set according to information stored on the memory module about the speeds it supports.

As far as clock pulses, no you don't *need* to add sinewaves together. All you need is for the voltage rise to be fast enough to trigger an edge detection circuit, and for the sinewave to be clean enough not to trigger false positives or negatives.

There has been a phenomena on youtube over the last few years that really illustrates the dangers of human targeted AI, it is alot to explain so keep with me. People realized that the youtube algorithm for video suggestions was exploitable, mainly because of how reliant it is on pop culture spikes, and found that if you put as many top hitcount topics in a video, youtube will passively push it. These people then wrote algorithms to make the most basic AI created videos to upload to youtube that best encompass the most buzz topics. Overtime these videos began to become extremely prominent and very lucrative, primarily because they tended to target children as things like frozen, spiderman, the avengers, and disney all are at the top of the list, and it happens that children are the most likely to watch an autoplay video, so you can reliably sneak into their feed unnoticed. However, what also is at the  top of the list are things like amputation, abortion, accidental death or injury, all kinds of adult topics, and it happens that those algorithms include those topics in these videos too. So now we have AI generated videos of Elsa from frozen getting an abortion from spiderman, or micky urinating himself while storm troopers cut his ears off, or some other off the wall batshit crazy video, being specifically targeted at children. All that is bad enough, but this is where the truly dystopian comes in. Adults, primarily in more relaxed regulatory nations, started to notice these videos were successful, and not understanding how to create the driving AI or why exactly the videos were doing so well, started to emulate them IRL to attempt to get a share of that lucrative niche. Suddenly, you have real world adults using real children in extremely random and adult situations for youtube videos to exploit their system. Real adults and children acting out abortion, amputation, scat, you name it so that these videos check the most boxes for recommendaton using youtubes own algorithm. Hence you have the situation where an unchecked AI designed to specifically catter to the whims of humans in a way that is most profitable, starts to directly influence the behavior of real humans trying to emulate them.

First I studied CS but work in patent law and miss programming.

Second, I have some motion switches but they don't work well in some rooms.

Third, I envisioned it going beyond lights. Like a contextual assistant in your pocket.

Music for various zones (like I have), one controlling the family room TV, another for the rest of the house, another for the outside. 

Fourth, biggest long shot would be applying it to possibly have robot butlers.

People working in the field call these ""questions"" feature extraction. One of the most successful AI architectures is to stack sets of these feature extractors together. The stacking allows increasingly more complex features to be extracted.

The sets of feature extractors tend to be very wide: there may be thousands, or even tens of thousands, of extractors operating over a large set of data (like a picture). Consequently it is relatively easy to take advantage of massively parallel computing. Putting all the cores on one chip, has obvious benefits for power consumption and operation latency.

For the more mathematically inclined, these feature extractors consist of differentiable tensor operations. For example an image classifier would make heavy use of matrix multiplications. The tensor operations are chained together into a graph, with a source (the AI's input) and a sink (the AI's output). The differentiable property is important: it allows an algorithm called backpropagation to be applied.

Even then it'll only be marginally so as the SLAM algorithm in the Windows MR software and the fact that it's only got 2 cameras are what I think cause the tracking issues I mentioned.

When I tried the Quest which I think has the same framerate as the Rift S (72Hz) I could definitely tell the difference in performance, especially when running something demanding like Beat Saber. Yet, because of good post-processing and various rendering trickery it didn't feel nearly as bad as I thought it'd be and I think the controllers have a far higher poll rate than the Windows MR ones, leading to overall smoother ""interactability"" if that's even a word.

So the Quest is completely standalone and is basically a Rift S, a 2 year-old smartphone and a decently sized battery glued together. It has its own somewhat closed operating system based on Android and has a store from which you can buy games, some of which have cross-buy between the Rift and the Quest. That means that the graphical quality of the games for it is much worse than on PC VR BUT it's not that bad. There are so many optimizations and clever engineering tricks thanks to the legendary John Carmack working on the project that make it punch way above its weight. And it has one major advantage over PC VR: no cable. It makes it so much more portable and inviting to use. Now all of that would be worthless if the VR bestseller Beat Saber didn't have custom songs but thankfully Oculus let users enable Android debugging on the Quest and install custom songs and mods. That also allows you to install ALVR which, if you have a PC with a recent video card and 5GHz WiFi lets you stream SteamVR games to the Quest. Granted, there is quite a bit of latency (~60ms on average from what I've read) so you won't be getting a better Beat Saber experience doing that but for games like SkyrimVR and FalloutVR it should work brilliantly.

So yeah, I consider the Quest to be the best VR headset for the average person, especially those without a powerful PC, a used Odyssey+ for those who want to get into sim games or just want the best displays on the market for cheap and don't care about controller inaccuracies, a Rift S for those who want to be competitive in Beat Saber and other titles that need quick reactions without being able to use external sensors (like having a small room, moving around a lot, etc), a regular used Vive/Rift for those who really need controller accuracy without spending too much money and an Index for those who want the absolute best VR experience on the market (although it's still not wireless).",1568297980,{},f006sve,False,t3_d34t2n,False,True,t1_f001rs0,/r/gadgets/comments/d34t2n/htc_vive_cosmos_vr_will_be_available_for_700_on/f006sve/,1568297993.0,1,True,[],False,gadgets,t5_2qgzt,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, that they created an algorithm with a fancy name doesn't automatically mean that this algorithm performs upsampling from a low resolution sensor to a high resolution image. For all we know, it could be an image post-processing algorithm doing whatever (brightness/contrast/gamma correction, sharpening etc.).

""ISOCELL Bright GW1 is a 64Mp image sensor (...)""

""GW1 can produce bright 16Mp images \[*my note: with Tetracell technology*\] in low-light environments and highly-detailed 64Mp shots in brighter settings.""

""Tetracell technology merges four pixels into one so that users can achieve high quality images in all light conditions.""

Assuming that the GW1 would not be a 64Mpx sensor...

... how could it produce a 16Mpx image when merging 4 pixels into one? In case it would physically be a 16Mpx sensor, wouldn't this 4:1 pixel merging produce 4Mpx images?

And this is how companies protect themselves for possible downstream income around something that they’ve patented. The same thing has been done with a hell of a lot a tech out there including things like “one click purchase buttons” in software, the MP3 algorithm and zillions more.

People and companies patent a concept or alpha version of something and if the technology evolves to point where the thing can be made and sold, they own the right to license the concept to other companies.

Those companies then have to pay royalties to use it. I’m looking at companies like Samsung for this one. I don’t know is this is practical of course but a lot of stuff starts out as just a concept and then it turns into something pretty amazing later on.

The early tablets for example were terrible. For example, the first tablet I ever saw or used was the Apple Newton and it was heavy, slow,expensive and came with very limited functionality. But look at the iPad today ...which still uses concepts (and patents) developed in the 70s and 80s.

Or look up the history of the GUI which evolved from concept to a working Xerox product (Altos) that wasn’t patented. Guess what happened- Microsoft, IBM, Apple and others “borrowed” the GUI concept and pushed Xerox out of the computer market in a matter of a few years.

You begin to read entire sentences or lines instead of having the voice in your head narrate each word.  It's a form of compression algorithm, really.  You stop focusing on the filler words. 

If I'm reading a beach book,  I read very quickly.  I know that I just don't give a crap about much of the descriptive filler in a Dan Brown book,  for example.  I get what I need and keep moving forward,  and I'm satisfied.  

If it's a deeper book,  I find myself slowing down to appreciate the imagery and language.  

The one main thing I've found,  is that if I really want to enhance my comprehension,  I'll speed read first, then set it down.  Then I'll go back and do it again.  My brain will slow on the parts it wants to.  I see it twice,  that helps automatically.  If I've allowed time to think about it,  my brain has questions that it will look for answers when seeing it again. 

I was always a strong reader,  and read voraciously as a child.  I can't suggest your brain will work like mine does.  I can suggest,  however,  that reading at any pace that allows you to enjoy the material, is best for you.  

If you're asking about this for studying purposes,  try my read- twice method.  See if it works for you.  You could also jot down notes or questions after your first skim, so you have focal points to catch and absorb better the second time.

This is a flash card program that uses a spaced repetition algorithm to help you memorize lots of words fairly quickly.  That sounds gimmicky, but it really isn't.  It's one of the most popular tools for people studying new languages and for people cramming for med school exams.

The idea is that you can have a long list of items you're studying (maybe thousands or even tens of thousands of words if you're studying a language), so you obviously can't review everything every day.  So, the program keeps track of how well you perform when quizzed over each word, and it adjusts the time between reviews accordingly.  Harder words show up more often.  Get a word right consistently and it gets pushed back further, since you obviously don't need to practice it as badly.

AI is dangerous, even today. It is created by people. We have AI so dumb today that a worm is light years ahead in intelligence. And that is the ""smartest"" we have.

But, at the end of the day, the AI we have is created by humans. And it has bugs. The code is flawed. This week google took down half the internet with it because they had a bug in what should have been a casual upgrade. Something they have done hundred of times failed miserably this week. And the sad part is that in order to fix the issue, they needed to be able to access the very systems that failed. So it took them considerably more to bring their network back that it should haven.

Suppose we have an AI running some important stuff. It is following the algorithm we designed for it. It is a recipe the AI has followed times and times again. Yet, one day, some random event makes it execute the code the wrong way. A bug we never considered surfaces. Or something we designed to work that particular way, but we failed to consider all possibilities. We are human, after all.

What if said AI, faced with the bug, and a scenario it never encountered before, decides the solution is to ""launch all the nukes?""

Think of the current self driving car technology. It has an AI at its core, but a very dumb one. It follows a lot of procedures and algorithms. Things it learned using current ""machine learning"" techniques.

yet, faced with an unavoidable event, like an inevitable crash, the algorithm makes a quick decision that means ""avoid everything and try to hit the smallest obstacle you can."" This is a real case scenario, and real code running on the google self driving cars, today. Not an ""what if.""

Well, what if the smallest possible obstacle is a child, but there is also a larger obstacle, say a barrel. The AI has no idea, it follows its instructions.

Is said AI dangerous? To me it sounds dangerous, as the event would result in hurting a child, when it can be avoided. The developers shrugged when asked this question.

As a developer myself, I can tell you, you will never find me in a self driving car. Self driving cars are already killing people. There's three or so incidents that resulted in fatalities, and a plethora of non lethal incidents. And, you know, the current self driving cars are in testing, and there's too few of them to mean anything in the grand scale of things. yet for how few of them are out there on the roads, they already have too many incidents.

The point is that even dumb as a rock AI is dangerous. Imagine what AI that can think for itself could do. The fear is real for a reason.

By no means did I intend to sound like a snob, ha ha.

,earthrise111,,,[],,,,text,t2_14035big,False,,"&gt;Can't respond to this because it's too vague, in your questions you seem to be referring to multiple kinds of shops. Still, I can think of plenty of ways to do it. Having a special bestseller section would be a good start, so that that one series doesn't take up all the space in that genre. It might just be a simple organisational problem.

Bookstores usually already have a special bestseller section.  They're either on end caps--the displays at the end of shelves--or drive aisles--the tables in the wide aisle between sections.  That's where you put the product you want to move *today.*  They can be current bestsellers, such as when a hot new YA novel comes out, or they can be the solid sellers in which companies expect to see a resurgence of interest, such as the copies of *Lord of the Rings* that will appear to coincide with the release of the new Amazon series.  (It's gonna happen.)

But, to be more precise, where should a bookseller to store eighteen copies of *Lord of the Rings* and a complete *Wheel of Time* if they only have sample copies on the shelves and sign reading ""request purchase copy at counter""?  (Not to mention other books that might fall into the category of forcing contemporary authors to unfairly compete with the ""dead guys.""  It doesn't just happen in fantasy.)  At my local B&amp;N, there's no room behind the counter because that's where they store special orders or books reserved online for pickup.  There's no room at Customer Service, which is a chair and a computer desk.  There's no room in Receiving, which is just a staging area for unloading the trucks and moving books onto the sales floor.  There's no room on the shelves or displays because they're occupied by stock.  Where would that store's employees store those books? 

&gt;You've got to agree with the spirit of what she's saying, though. In an ideal world, a company would forfeit a little bit of profits. The more the chances of discovering something new, the more walk-in customers you have, and that may even lead to an increase in profit.

Barnes and Nobel is a publicly traded company in the US, which means it is bound by law to prioritize shareholder interests.  It *can't* ""forfeit a little bit of profits.""  At best, it would sued by shareholders.  At worst, there could be an investigation of its business practices.

Also, corporations don't work on ""may.""  They work on ""will.""  If you can prove that pulling Tolkien and doubling the number of 2017 Nebula nominees will lead to an increase in customers and profits, they'll do it yesterday.  They haven't because they've run their sales numbers and anticipate that Tolkien will move in greater numbers than Lee.  (And if they're wrong, employees will weep on opening the next shipment of Tolkien and curse whichever algorithm told corporate those books were in demand for that store.)

&gt;I think that's what she is complaining about. She even says that we should support indie stores who do value something more than just profits. I wholeheartedly concur.

I don't see a problem with that.  What's unreasonable is to expect a large corporate chain to behave like an indie store.  You don't go to Barnes and Noble to find the offbeat new book; you go to your offbeat, locally owned bookstore.  (Also, the indie store values profits just as much as the corporate store.  The difference is they're filling a different niche in the industry.  They're tailored to different customers.  If they could make more money adopting a Barnes and Noble approach, they would adopt it yesterday.)",1553572037,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eje6fl1,,t3_b5h66y,,True,t1_ejdrxz0,/r/books/comments/b5h66y/science_fiction_and_fantasy_author_fonda_lee/eje6fl1/,1553572038.0,1,True,,False,books,t5_2qh4i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong* was really good, highlighting the issue of ""the winners write the history books.""

*The Science of Enlightenment: Teachings and Meditations for Awakening Through Self-Investigation* I found really interesting because of its mix of data and real-world practice.

*Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy* was really interesting because it highlights in the rush of ""algorithm all the things"" very often no one ever checks ""what about when it's wrong?""

*Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest &amp; Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics* because I felt I was lacking in Economics (and I still am) but it was a good refresher.

*The Most Dangerous Man in America: Timothy Leary, Richard Nixon and the Hunt for the Fugitive King of LSD* was just highly entertaining, and informative into the formation of the war on drugs (I feel like a lot of knowledge is inferred, but this taps into Nixon more, and the politics of the era)

*Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration* was recommended by a manager of a design and usability group, and it was an interesting insight of blending two different companies cultures and employees (Disney and Pixar) and the subsequent internal conflicts.

*The Wisdom of Crowds* is a good read about group think vs. sheep think. It's been a while since I've read this one, I need a refresher.

I find myself being a fan of a lot of Malcolm Gladwell's writing (*Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking*), but they're often great story telling books that lack the necessary backups you want, so they're entertaining reads, but just… lacking.

*How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People* is a good primer on ""don't be a selfish dick.""

*Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)* - I'm just a sucker for big data and correlation.

*The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life* was a fun, entertaining read. There's nothing ground breaking at all, so it does fall in the trap of ""you've read this before/you can see where he's going"" but it's still a fun read.

*Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative* now - this is also a ""amusing, but you're being fed"" book. Actually, we can sum it up:
1. Steal like an artist
2. Don't wait until you know who you are to get started
3. Write the book you want to read
4. Use your hands
5. Side projects and hobbies are important
6. Do good work and share it with people
7. Geography is no longer our master
8. Be nice (the world is a small town)
9. Be boring (it's the only way to get work done)
10. Creativity is subtraction

If you need more details, get it from your library.

*Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* oh man, I really enjoyed this read. It felt smart, but accessible. Entertaining and informative.

I mean, this is just the shit I enjoyed, so you may look at this list and roll your eyes (and you're totally justified to do to), as my cup of tea may not be for you.

He seems to echo a lot of the new agey stuff such as blaming the people of a certain colour or nationality over things they had no influence over, assign the term privileged to people and so on.

For a quite smart man with a keen understanding of language and differences in culture, he seems fail to understanding that's hes sellin a different flavor of the same ice cream. He's driving a wedge too, it's just that his particular wedge isn't one of racial slurs, it's one of telling a certain subset of people that they have it easy and that all that they've done in life is mostly because the system favored them and that their grit and determination are of little influence or consequence.

He also annoyed me when people called the French NT team Africa and the French ambassador said that the French see themselves as the French and they dont hyphonate because it drives up the differences between people. In that moment Trevor said that he was proud of their Africaness (whatever the hell that means) and that it doesn't matter to him what the ambassador said.

Sorry but you don't get to decide Trevor, the player's do. You don't get to tell the people that they are inherently African or in some large part that because you want to feel proud of shared but very distant roots. The players have the right of self determination and maybe some feel at least a bit African, maybe others don't at all, but the point is that it wasn't his place to decide.

Also one of the points of the letter which he missed conpletely is that Team Africa was a sort of a racial slur, the point of the letter was to firmly assert that France refuses to see the players as anything below a bona fide 100% baguette eating, cigarette smoking art loving Frenchie.

If you take what’s happening in the book for example, the character can’t call the police because they’re working with the assassins. So he has two choices: let them live and know they’ll come after him in the future or just dispose of them now. He could also wait until they wake up and then kill them, but I don’t think that’s anymore moral than just doing it while they’re unconscious. 

&gt; The ""unconscious"" bit is what matters.

I’m glad it matters to you. It doesn’t matter to me. The two people chasing him followed him to his sisters house before he knocked them unconscious. If he lets them go, they’ll literally know where his sister lives and will tell their superiors. Letting them live is such a bad decision, but the author didn’t want people like you to dislike the character, so better for him to risk his sister’s life. 

I really don’t get it. If he killed those two people in battle, no one would have an issue. They’re knocked out and he does it and suddenly he’s the bad guy. I don’t think it matters if they’re unconscious. It matters that they tried to kill him.

What's there to be mind-blowing?    This is a real-life criminal justice issue.    

You can't kill a person if they're unconscious, no matter how much of a threat they were.  One person doesn't get to decide life or death, not on their own. 

If they're a member of the military and send on a kill-or-capture mission, where killing this person is an acceptable goal, that's the only time it is not morally wrong, because people in authority (President,  JSOC command, whatever)  have given the weight of societal approval to those actions.   It becomes legal. 

This matters.   Killing a person should never be easy, and if done at all, should have the weight of authority and society's sanction behind it.    This is the same reason that killing the enemy in war is not considered murder.   The same reason defending your home is not murder:   Society has decided on the morality of that action.

It was interesting to hear the events unfold from an aunt’s POV, from someone who grew up within Gilead, and from an outsider. As I moved closer to the end of the book, I got more and more anxious for how everything would turn out. Maybe some events were mildly predictable, but the journey to the end kept me turning page after page as quickly as I could. 

The one chord that strikes me wrong with the book is the whole supposed political implications to the USA today — both drawn by Atwood in some interviews and by many readers, including some here. I read fiction to escape the world around me, not to have political ideologies shoved down my throat. I enjoyed the book as a piece of dystopian fiction and continuation of its predecessor.

As to multi-cellular organisms there are many papers about how biology made the leap from single cell to multicellurar. 

googling the specific questions might help you but remember google algorithm only returns results similar to the ones you have previously clicked on.

Ask a rhetoric professor such as the eminent Dale Carrico and he'll tell you that this manner of speaking is employed in order to subjugate and dehumanize people.

Unfortunately, we know the answers to these questions and the answers are despicable almost beyond belief. Ask the historians. Many layers of frankly fake popular history have painted over our superstitious past as a time of madness and irrationality, but when people believed in mystical and sacred souls we might notice some major differences. The quite recently popular viewpoint that humans are soulless mechanical objects has underpinned what are undeniably the most violent, repressive, and barbaric acts of all time.

Because that's basically what you're getting. I mean, I know some of the guys who do it, and it would probably hurt their feelings to hear that. But it's true. Most of those books are written in a single draft, often at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 or MORE words per day. 

They crank out as many book as quickly as possible specifically BECAUSE Amazon's algorithm favors quick releases in terms of promoting the book. MASSIVELY. So if you have a readable first book that you practically give away, with at least one resolved plot line to prevent people from being pissed off at a non-conclusion, you can then string those same characters out over multiple books, releasing one every two weeks. The sales bumps from the first combine with the visibility bump of a new release to drive up their ratings rapidly.

I had this happen to me once and got up to #39 in the world in thriller writers for a few months. As to why I haven't done it again? Mostly vanity. I'm trying to write better books, not more of them. Eventually, however, I'll have to shore up the income by cranking out a new pulp fiction series.

Really, these guys are filling the slots left by the old 'dime store' novelists who got paid fuck all for their work and got little credit, usually giving up rights as well. At least with ebooks and Amazon, they get a 67% royalty. Unfortunately, basic pulp fiction just ain't that hard to write, so the number of people trying to make a buck has skyrocketed.

And I don't mean they are useless, just that for a lot of things, wether it's bombers, tanks, or artillery, we already have 90% of the job automated, making an algorithm take the decision to shoot won't improve the performances.

Now for infantry, there's definitely cases to use them, especially to scout areas, get rid of snipers, or just check for IEDs. And in that regard, they could be quite usefull, even though using them in areas like moutains in Afghanistan or urban environment in Syria would really be a challenge in terms of ability to work on any terrain, as well as maintenance. 

Now the thing everyone is scared about is more ""volatile"" weapons like drones (not big ones like predator, but little ones like the commercial ones we see everywhere) , and I really don't think the US or the UK really want their soldiers in the middle east to be subject to such attack, because those weapons would be quite easy to capture and reverse engineer, unlike let's say a robot with tracks and one gun - which is one of thing I saw in a unveiling recently -. 

Just think about it, ISIS was using commercial drones to bomb Iraqi commanders, scout areas. Giving them a piece of code that does the targeting for them wouldn't be such a great idea. 

Now, developing such weapons to use against other superpowers, sure, is something I see them doing, but I don't think they plan to have them as anything else as a ace in their sleeve, rather than a commonly used weapon.

There are limits.  The living have to work to keep the digital ghost alive.  That's unfair.  Your growth is also going to simply be an algorithm based on 100% fabrication.  There'd be no point to life.  You could live 1000 lives in an hour since your perception of time is just code.  If you don't interact with the real world you're existence is pointless simulation.  You'd do no good to anyone but yourself.  If all you want to do is be happy and have everything you want then why waste time with growth and interaction?  We can do that be simply removing everything from your code that allows you to feel anything but content.  That's not human.

Also why copy bad code?  When you get a virus on your hard drive you don't want to mirror the drive.  It'll still contain the virus.  In the case of depressed humans that virus will carry over and it is part of what you are.  If you eliminate it you've made a new being not a copy of yourself.  If we're going to make a perfect digital being we'd do it from scratch not start with a flawed base code.

It's not true immortality.  Even if the original is destroyed it is still just a digital copy and not you(likely not even legally you either when we get to that point).  Since it's not true immortality the digital version of you has no rights.  You'll be a slave to a corporation that doesn't see the point in employing living beings anymore.

,InFearn0,,,[],,,,text,t2_bbkpr,,,"&gt; PS: This question has been brought to you by me picking up the Honor Harrington series! What a gem!

I think the second book in the series has a really good part where ~~Scotty Tremaine~~ is dealing with the missile ECCM.  *Edit: I think I got the character wrong.  The point is that part of missile combat is missile duels, and that means creating the better computer algorithm for recognizing reality while fooling the other side's algorithm.*

Another thing to consider is ""Should there be space battles at all?""

Once you start having interstellar travel, there is a lot of real estate available.  There would definitely be policing (because criminals will probably always exist), but defense forces should (in theory) always have vastly superior resources.

Right now, everything humans need (that is produced by an economy) is produced by Earth.  Why should we not expect a colony to not be similar self-sufficient 10+ years after being founded? *You think things are bad for countries that can't grow their own food? Imagine if it was a planet far from support that couldn't grow its own food!*

In general there is zero reason for humans to try to colonize any planet that is too ""off-spec"" for human habitation, when they can just find a better candidate star/planet combo.

And remember that right now we have over 7 billion people living on Earth.  If we weren't divided we could probably support a lot more with little to no poverty.

And depending on what the travel times are like, it could very easily mean permanent goodbyes (for all practical purposes).  Not just to people, but to culture.  For example, if you went off to be a colonist on [Planet many years away], you might never get to read *Uncompromising Honor* or any other future books in the series.  Okay, maybe that isn't true, but the point is that any cultural/entertainment exchange is going to be a weird thing to sync, so hopefully there are other artists in the colony to fill the void.",1531177379,,e238raa,False,t3_8x4wa9,,True,t3_8x4wa9,/r/scifi/comments/8x4wa9/request_if_most_scifi_fleet_battles_look_like_ww2/e238raa/,1535851815.0,2,True,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,1531254313.0,,,,1365998253.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1.0,92304.0,r/scifi,public,False,

,APeacefulWarrior,,,,,,,,t2_3o5g9,,,"It depends on what you mean by ""composing"" or ""writing.""  All an AI can do right now is take a lot of pre-existing works, digest them, average them, and then create a piece which is basically just a regurgitation of that average.

You could, for example, program an AI to imitate the works of Picasso and create ""original"" Cubist paintings.  But an AI with today's technology -or anything foreseeable in the near future- could **never** invent Cubism as a movement, or something similarly innovative.  It would simply be imitating Picasso, mindlessly placing pixels with no intention, no motivation, no creativity - following an algorithm that reduces Cubism to little more than a connect-the-dots process.  And with no evolution in its artistic process past a point.

Same with composing.  Hell, we've had computers ""composing"" music for decades.  The abstract\atonal electronic soundtrack for Forbidden Planet was made largely through procedural methods.  Or, in a more direct comparison, there was ""CPU Bach,"" a 3DO program made by Sid Meier that could create [rough approximations](https://youtu.be/8QLQ_mYXf1I?t=5m21s) of baroque music.  But, again, it can only create very basic ""noodling"" piano pieces derived from Bach's less exceptional output.  It could never compose something like the [St. Matthew Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-miQ6_FTtN0).

And, of course, the same is true of writing - although it's a problem of much greater complexity.  Some news outlets already use AIs to do extremely formulaic writing, like stock reporting, where it's little more than a ""Mad Libs"" fill-in-the-blank-template process.  There's even been an attempt to have a computer write an [averaged horror movie](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3710326/AI-writes-perfect-horror-script-Film-produced-help-computer-terrifying-yet.html), although it was basically nothing but a mashup of scenes most commonly found in other horror movies.   Their ""perfected"" horror movie is literal hackery.

Another issue here is cause-and-effect.  Current ""imitative"" AIs just aren't smart enough (by orders of magnitude) to understand cause and effect.  Most are literally just writing word by word by word without any concept of the bigger picture.  Because, again, they're iterative routines without any actual comprehension of the materials they're creating.  But understanding cause-and-effect is vital for any sort of creative storytelling endeavor to have cohesion.

Will a computer be able to compose a novel one day?  Maybe?  Probably.  But it would require strong GAI for a computer to write an *original* novel, or create an artistic movement, which isn't just rote mindless imitation of human sources.  Creating original art requires communicative intent, and that's something a weak AI algorithm can simply never have.",1519197231,,dul4yad,False,t3_7ym8zs,,,t3_7ym8zs,/r/scifi/comments/7ym8zs/the_potential_for_artificial_intelligence_in_the/dul4yad/,1520075030.0,1,,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,1519205840.0,,,,1255231365.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,154663.0,,public,,

I've never read *Old Man's War*, and have never heard of anyone referring to a ""skip drive"".

The origin of the *Foundation*'s hyperdrive is a fun story, and I wish the author had been aware of it:  The mathematics was beyond human comprehension, but needed more intuition than a mere computer could provide, so it was given over to AI's to compute.

The mechanics of the jump involved the ship moving out of the space/time continuum into a space where all dimensions were essentially zero. But the Asimov's positronic AI's were programmed with the 3 Laws of Robotics, which did not allow an AI to allow harm to come to humans. So when they were ordered to create an algorithm for moving humans into this space, they all saw it as destroying the humans, and burned out before being able to calculate any further.

They eventually had to create a specialized AI with a childlike personality and a softened outlook on the First Law, and told it ""hey, if you get to a part where you foresee harm to humans, don't worry about it, just finish the equation"" It got driven a little mad, and kind of decided to fuck with the first hypernauts a bit.

Space scenes, cg creatures (did they have any?), and other more complicated vfx might need to be recreated from scratch.

The audio mix has me worried, but with algorithms that can identify re-used sound effects and music elements, and whatever audio stems or other elements are available for a remaster, an audio remix (in the word's true sense) isn't out of the question. If the algorithm places the recurring elements into the mix automatically, the manhours remixing the audio would be significantly reduced.

When I say fast, I mean fast. Like, there is no reasonable defense against an object heading towards you at near light speed. A crayola crayon (2 grams) at 99% the speed of light packs 2×10¹⁴ Joules of energy. 

One gram of TNT has about 4×10³ Joules of energy. So the equivalent amount of TNT when our crayon hits the earth is on the order of 8×10¹⁰ grams of TNT. 80 megatonnes. The largest nuke ever developed had 25 megatonnes (B41). 

Launching a crayola crayon wipes out major cities. Launching a 96 colour pack destroys the environment and instigated nuclear winter. Relativistic energy is no joke. God forbid you launch a few kilograms at a time - punch mountain sides holes in planets. A small asteroid cracks a planet in half. 

An incoming crayon at 0.99c is travelling at such high speeds that the light that it is pushing in front of it arrives only moments before it hits. There's no need for stealth. No radar system can detect something that small (it's cross section is smaller than radar wavelengths). You just die without warning.

The only defense is a satellite swarm which cuts off the entire view of the stars and lets no light in. This swarm needs to be several layers thick and moving erratically, or they just launch crayons in quick succession to punch through the holes. 

Basically, living on a planet gets you killed. There is no need to have infantry or tanks when your artillery wins the war in the first moment.

Tl;dr at the bottom. 
You basically have two scenarios, one like the Earth and the Moon where one body orbits the other, and one like, say, Earth and Mars, where they co-orbit a third body.
With the earth-moon scenario, it would just be difficult to have it be a very energetic collision. De-orbiting the moon would take a lot of energy, as it would require bringing it's orbital speed to ~0; this would require disgusting amounts of energy, and would really only result in the moon ""falling"" from orbit to collide with its planet. This would take longer than would perhaps be practical for a weapon. 
The Earth-Mars scenario **might** work better. You could deflect the outer planet into the path of the inner by strategic pulses of power to ellipticize the orbit so it crossed the inner orbit, and even if you missed the gravitational effects of the bodies passing one another would likely destabilize the orbit of the target body. Again, this would take preposterous amounts of energy. This would be a complicated procedure mathematically as well--one would have to calculate or hope that the bodies would end up in the same place at the same time, which could take many orbits (e.g. Years). This, too would be a very slow process, diminishing its effectiveness as a weapon. 
Collision with another planet-sized body is also overkill. A couple of large-ish asteroids moving at near-relativistic speeds and intercepting different areas of the planet's surface would be more than enough to destroy the entire surface of the planet, and would be much easier to guide, hide before impact, and destroy quickly.

Are you trying to suggest that this isn't how silicon valley works? :) Silicon valley is also a gated industry. Perhaps in the beginning yes, the internet was an open opportunity for anyone with an idea. It's not like that anymore. Venture capital controls everything.  But we shouldn't kid ourselves that silicon valley and the tech industry will be the saviours of cinema. 

Remember in the early days of the Internet we dreamed of how the Net was going to democratize access to things like News and we would no longer be under the shackles of large news and media organisations. The internet held such promise, it was going to tear down walls and destroy corporate power. Hurray! 

Except that's not what happened. 

Today we just have different corporate overlords. And algorithms are deciding what news and content we consume, who we interact with, who gets visibility and who doesn't. Data and algorithms are used to decide everything. Corporations like Facebook now are in positions where information can be manipulated to the point where they can influence election outcomes. Yeah, I don't think we should be cheering for the tech industry to be taking over independent cinema. This bullshit about how the internet can transform traditional industries for the positive betterment of society is a message from 15-20 years ago. Today we know better. 

Personally, I could care less if silicon valley wants to take over the role of big Hollywood studios. Those guys were a mafia anyway. But this debate isn't about Hollywood. It's about independent filmmaking and ensuring that filmmakers have not just have access to funding to get their films made but they also have an outlet to show their work. Film festivals and independent cinema are one of the last bastions of free expression and one of the few avenues through which storytelling can challenge/expose/resist the narratives of the powerful. Western society is at a critical crossroad, where so much of the information and content we consume is being used to control and manipulate us. The last thing we need is the tech industry taking over independent cinema. 

So we shouldn't kid ourselves that this battle in film festivals is a battle between Hollywood and silicon valley. It's not. The big studios were never really that invested in independent cinema anyway and they have already squeezed it out of the big corporate cinema chains. No, this is a battle for film festivals and independent cinema being able to remain as an outlet for independent voices, where funding isnt decided based on an algorithm.",1568099654,{},ezsntqd,False,t3_d1z0yi,False,True,t1_ezrmxzz,/r/movies/comments/d1z0yi/netflix_amazon_movies_banned_from_toronto_film/ezsntqd/,1568099654.0,1,True,[],False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have probably near a hundred titles on the list. Basically it's punishing me for not watching enough content. I found the quickest way was to instead go to the My List from the left menu which gives a larger tiled display that's faster to scroll. Without playlists there are titles I've saved in My List that I've forgotten about, and so has Netflix's suggestion algorithm. Now with the new additions buried I've already had a confusing moment of thinking it just didn't add titles to My List anymore.

Netflix has let the marketing team and its algorithm drive the UI for too long. It's a user nightmare and antagonistic to the user. To the point that it's more of an Ad Interface than User Interface.

Though HBO GO just did a kind of slick UI update, it still doesn't do much in terms of innovation. It's incredible that these streaming companies spend billions on content and spend zero fucks on making a solid feature filled user friendly UI.

He knows plenty and can do really deep dives into obscure aspects of the film industry.

His videos are editorials, though. He expresses his opinions. They are persuasive essays, wherein he attempts to win you over to his way of thinking. Some work, some don’t, and everyone’s different. 

You are not obliged to agree with him except where he is discussing facts. You also don’t have to like his personality, format, or delivery. That’s all fine.

He wasn’t shading Ellis. That was a comment on how Youtubers have to appease the algorithm in order to have success. 

The T.S. Eliot book is largely irrelevant. Eliot wrote the poems for kids, and it’s pretty light on substance. The stage musical Cats uses a lot of the names and just a few ideas, but is otherwise pretty much it’s own thing.

I mean, it’s basically Dr. Seuss if he could only write about cats and wasn’t allowed to make up words. There’s nothing especially profound to draw from. You shouldn’t have an issue with him not analyzing the book the musical was based on.

And that’s as far as I’m going on this. But, yeah, Hooper’s films have an atrocious and baffling style about them. I liked the King’s Speech, and its offbeat directorial choices. I thought they served the narrative. But when he keeps using the same bag of tricks film after film, regardless of whether it fits or not, clearly the man doesn’t know what he’s doing aside from being offbeat. And it doesn’t play in a lot of contexts. 

You’re just nitpicking. Oh comment on things that you admit you don’t know about or understand.., it’s all just masturbatory. 

Also, a line by line rundown of the things you don’t like is a terrible critical format. See, at least Willems knows how to express himself in a coherent and entertaining manner. Start with a thesis, introduce evidence, build your case.

Maybe you could learn something from the “pretentious snob who doesn’t really know what he’s talking about”.

PS... IMDb ratings are GARBAGE. Stop citing them as if they mean anything. If an average person sits through a movie and doesn’t have a negative reaction to it they automatically give it a 7 or higher... it doesn’t mean it’s that’s good or particularly well-liked. It’s just fine. It’s fine.

This is a game that procedurally generates NPCs. That uses pre-set algorithms. There are parameters and variables that create the guidelines for each instantiated NPC object. Such parameters would be attributes, names, physical features, pathing routine, etc. 

Trying to identify each NPC that has a “bug” like that would be difficult (and probably wouldn’t make much sense for procedural generation). If they labeled those NPCs, that wouldn’t be easy at all. That would require adjusting their attribute assignments in the algorithm to match the propagation of the “bug” itself. 

If they are able to label each (procedurally generated) NPC with the “bug” that they may “die randomly” while knowing not to label NPCs without the “bug”, then they’ve already done MOST of the work in fixing the bug. From there, it’s literally just following the bread crumbs back to the source of the bug. 

Labeling NPCs with an attribute isn’t lazy. Ignoring the “bug” would be lazy. Just by my knowledge of how basic programming works tells me there isn’t any actual “bug” and it’s a legitimate feature (also my reading comprehension). 

If you can understand what goes into designing algorithms for procedural generation, then you’d realize that a dev turning a “bug” into a feature like this is a hell of a lot less likely than, I don’t know, an NPC that “hasn’t been to the doctor in 25 years” that’s supposed to have the attribute “may die randomly”. 

Please think about how complex systems like this work instead of relying on the context of analogies that don’t work at all. Cars aren’t generated procedurally. They’re made to all be the same from a factory. Identifying the problem is easy. 

It’s not easy for procedural generation because it’s difficult to identify patterns.

“DO NOT BE AFRAID,” came a vast booming voice from directly behind him.

Moses screamed, tried to turn around, lost his footing, and fell down in a heap upon the blue rocks.

“SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY.” The source of the voice was a vast entity that towered above him, a humanoid creature with great golden wings protruding from its back and eyes that shone like the sun. “SORRY SORRY SORRY.”

Moses pulled himself into a more dignified kneeling position. “My Lord,” he said reverently.

“UM,” said Uriel. “I AM SORT OF FILLING IN FOR HIM. HE DOES NOT DO VERY MUCH. IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN.”

“My Lord,” repeated Moses. “With a mighty hand, you freed my people from slavery in Egypt.”

“UM,” said the archangel. “IT IS SOMEWHAT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. THE EGYPTIANS WERE BUILDING THESE PYRAMIDS WHICH THEY THOUGHT TAPPED INTO THE COSMIC ENERGIES OF THE UNIVERSE. AND THEY DID TAP INTO THE COSMIC ENERGIES OF THE UNIVERSE. NOT FOR THE REASONS THEY THOUGHT, WHICH WERE PRETTY MUCH THE WORST SORT OF PRIMITIVE HOCUS-POCUS, BUT JUST BECAUSE ANYTHING BIG AND GEOMETRIC IS GOING TO MESS UP THE FLOW OF DIVINE LIGHT IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. I ASKED THEM TO STOP BUT THEY WOULDN’T. I TRIED FRIGHTENING THEM BY TURNING THEIR RIVERS TO BLOOD, BUT THEY JUST MURMURED SOMETHING ABOUT “PHYTOPLANKTON” AND KEPT DOING IT. THEN I SENT THEM A BUNCH OF FROGS, BUT THAT DIDN’T HELP EITHER. FROGS NEVER HELP. THEN I GOT KIND OF CARRIED AWAY.”

“But when our people reached the Sea of Reeds, and we thought that all was lost, I prayed to you, and you parted the sea, so we could cross freely.”

“THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BUILD PYRAMIDS IF THEY DON’T HAVE A LABOR FORCE? SO I PARTED THE SEA SO THEIR SLAVES COULD ESCAPE. I THINK IT WAS A GOOD PLAN.”

“And when the last among us had stepped out from the waters, you sent them crashing down upon the Pharaoh and his army, destroying them and their wickedness forever.”

“I HAVE NOT WORKED OUT ALL OF THE BUGS IN THE PART_SEA FUNCTION.”

“Now we have come to you for advice. It is through your grace that we are free, but we know not what to do with our freedom. The people demand laws, a code to live by, something to bring meaning and structure to their lives.”

“UM. I THINK YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST BE NICE TO EACH OTHER. UNLESS BEING NICE TO EACH OTHER WOULD CAUSE SOME SORT OF HORRIBLE PROBLEM I CANNOT ANTICIPATE RIGHT NOW. THEN YOU SHOULD NOT DO THAT.”

“Please, O Lord! You must have more advice than that, advice which can sustain us in spirit as we cross this scorching desert.”

“WEAR SUNSCREEN?”

“Lord, the Egyptians are the mightiest people in the world, but they are mighty because their priests rule every minute of their lives, from the ritual ablutions they perform upon waking up to the prayers they say before they go to bed at night. If our people are left adrift, without laws and rituals to connect them to You and thank You for your gift of freedom, I fear they will go astray.”

“AH. I THINK I UNDERSTAND. ACTUALLY, THIS TIES INTO ANOTHER PROJECT OF MINE. I AM GRADUALLY SHIFTING THE WORLD FROM ON A SUBSTRATE OF DIVINE LIGHT TO A SUBSTRATE OF MECHANICAL COMPUTATION. THE MECHANICAL SUBSTRATE HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS PERFECTLY PREDICTABLE. FOR ANOTHER, IT ALLOWS EVEN LOW-LEVEL USERS SUCH AS YOURSELF TO COMBINE PHYSICAL FORCES IN NOVEL WAYS TO SOLVE YOUR OWN PROBLEMS AS THEY ARISE. MOST IMPORTANT, IT IS MORE ROBUST AGAINST DEMONIC INTRUSION. IN FACT, ANGELS AND DEMONS ARE PRETTY MUCH INERT ON A MECHANICAL SUBSTRATE. IT INVOLVES VARIOUS INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SEPHIROT AND KLIPOT. ARE YOU FAMILAR WITH THESE? IF NOT I CAN EXPLAIN.”

“The laws, O Lord?”

“RIGHT NOW COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES ARE THE MAJOR BOTTLENECK IN THE PROJECT. I HAVE A LIST OF STEPS THAT END USERS COULD TAKE TO SAVE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES.”

“And these would be the laws?”

“I PERFORM SERVER MAINTENANCE ON SATURDAYS. THIS MEANS LOWER CAPACITY. SO PLEASE AVOID HIGH-LOAD ACTIVITIES LIKE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, AGRICULTURAL WORK, AND ELECTRICITY USE DURING THAT TIME. SO YES. THAT IS A LAW.”

“My Lord, what is ‘electricity’?”

“SO IMAGINE THAT EVERYTHING IS MADE UP OF THESE TINY OBJECTS. YOU COULD IMAGINE THEY ARE SORT OF LIKE BILLIARD BALLS WITH SMALLER BILLIARD BALLS CIRCLING AROUND THEM, EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY CIRCLING. THEY ARE MORE LIKE A POSSIBILITY OF THERE BEING A BILLIARD BALL, AND THE POSSIBILITY FORMS A CIRCLE. UM. A SPHERE. EXCEPT THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS A SPHERE. THE FIRST TWO LOOK SORT OF LIKE SPHERES, BUT THE NEXT THREE ARE KIND OF LIKE FIGURE EIGHTS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO ONE ANOTHER, AND THEN ANOTHER SPHERE, THEN THREE MORE FIGURE EIGHTS, AND THEN MORE COMPLICATED THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF HARD TO DESCRIBE. UM. THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE COMPLICATED TO EXPLAIN THAN I THOUGHT. ELECTRICITY IS KIND OF LIKE STARTING A FIRE. YOU WILL KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT.”

“Um, yes, my Lord. Anything else?”

“YES. DO NOT MIX DIFFERENT KINDS OF FABRIC IN YOUR GARMENTS. IT COMPLICATES THE TEAR RESISTANCE CALCULATIONS.”

“And?”

“DO NOT BOIL A GOAT IN ITS MOTHER’S MILK. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS STRANGE, BUT EVERY TIME SOMEONE TRIES THIS, THE ENTIRE SEPHIRAH HANDLING THE CONTINENT WHERE IT HAPPENS CRASHES. I HAVE SPENT AEONS OF SUBJECTIVE TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM AND I HAVE PRETTY MUCH GIVEN UP. JUST DO NOT DO IT. DO NOT DO ANYTHING SORT OF LIKE IT. JUST AVOID THAT ENTIRE CATEGORY OF THING.”

“And?”

“UM. I FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS. BUT I AM TRYING TO ASSIGN EVERYONE A UNIQUE SOULMATE. RIGHT NOW I AM USING A VARIANT OF THE GALE-SHAPLEY ALGORITHM, BUT IT IS VERY RESOURCE-INTENSIVE. I THINK LIMITING THE ALGORITHM TO MALE-FEMALE PAIRINGS WOULD MAKE IT RUN MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY WITH ONLY A SLIGHT PENALTY IN OPTIMAL MATE ALLOCATION.”

“I don’t understand.”

“THE ALGORITHM WILL WORK BETTER IF YOU TELL PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS.”

“I see,” said Moses. “It is an abomination.”

“IT IS JUST VERY KLUDGY AND VERY SLOW. I CAN REMOVE THE LIMITATIONS ONCE I HAVE MORE RAM.”

“We can sacrifice some to you once we build a proper Temple,” said Moses.

“UM,” said Uriel. “I AM ALMOST CERTAIN YOU CANNOT. BUT I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.” He stood for a second, lost in thought. “THERE ARE MANY RULES. IT WILL TAKE ME A LONG TIME TO THINK OF ALL OF THEM. YOU SHOULD GO CHECK ON YOUR PEOPLE. COME BACK UP IN A FEW WEEKS AND I WILL GIVE YOU A COMPLETE LIST.”

“Yes, my Lord,” said Moses.

…

Forty days and forty nights later, the old man trudged back up the slopes of the mountain.

[],blackburn009,,,[],,,,text,t2_jekxh,False,,"Ok so here's a guide from a person who doesn't currently have a cube in front of them and can't speed cube. it's going to be hard to follow, use no face notation, have no pictures, I'm only mobile, and might have a wrong step but sure look it's worth a try. It's also going to have memory tricks which aren't helpful if you're following a guide but might help you later.

**What is the cube**

This is obvious if you think about it but many people don't, there's 26 pieces to a cube (3*3*3 without the middle piece). The 6 middle pieces cannot move relative to each other and are your landmarks to solve, so there's only 20 pieces you need to move.

There are 4 corner pieces and 4 side pieces for each colour which aren't interchangeable it's always important which of these pieces are where, just because one side is the same colour doesn't mean that side is done. I'll refer to pieces as, for example ""white red"" meaning a side pieces containing white and red, and ""white red blue"" being a corner piece with all 3

**A dictionary of terms I use**

If this explains everything I say it's a miracle. All rotations I say are by 1 quarter rotation.

[Colour] side: the side where the middle square is [Colour]

Side piece: a piece with 2 colours on it

Bottom layer: since we're putting white on top this will refer to yellow side unless otherwise stated

Bottom row: the row that touches the bottom layer

Middle row: the row containing the red blue orange green middle squares

Top row: for completeness, the row touching the top layer

Side face: when something is on the bottom or top row, one of the colors is on the ""side face"" and one is on the top or bottom face

Pull down: rotate the left or right side towards you.

**Top layer**

**The plus**

So put the white middle square on top, you can be faster if you pick a better one but this isn't a speed guide.  

So what you want to do is bring the white side pieces up. This should be straightforward, but note where you're putting the sides, white red should be across from white orange, and when you rotate the cube the right way all the side pieces should touch the middle piece of the same colour. 

**The corners**

Bringing the corners up is slightly more awkward, ideally you want it on the bottom row below where you want it, then move it out of the way 1, bring the side down, move it back in place, and bring the side up. Here you want the corners to be touching the side pieces of the same colour, so the ""red white blue"" corner touches red at its red side and blue at its blue side. If it's the wrong way around you've likely done the plus step wrong.

**The middle row**

The top layer should be white, and the top row should be the same colour as its middle squares, making a T shape. To fill in the bits between the T we need our first real algorithm. 

So what you want to do is find a side with two non-yellow colours on the bottom row and put it below the colour that's on its side face, to make a big T. Call this piece P because I'm a mathematician and I like variables.

move it **away** from the side of its bottom face, pull down the side of where you want the piece to go, bring P back to where it was and pull the side back up. You should be left with a white piece that can be easily picked up from another side. Move it away from the side it's directly under, bring that side down, move the white back and bring them all up as a line of 3. 

If everything was done correctly your top layer is completely untouched and the piece is in the hole. Repeat this at least 4 times and if there's a piece in the right place but the wrong way around, move it out using the same move, putting a random piece in its place and then put it back in the right way around.

**The bottom layer**

You've this far but now it's time to get funky. There's a lot of ways to do this so I'm going to say how I do it. **Turn the cube upside down time**

**The plus**

Until I say so, **Ignore the bottom row**, that is the one touching the yellow face. It's on top now. We'll fix which yellows are where after we put them onto the bottom face.

When holding a cube from now on

Yellow face is top.  
Front is facing you.  
Back facing away from you.  
East is the face on your right hand   
Similar for West.  I'll try be consistent.

The bottom of the cube for the 4 sides, ignoring corners should be one of:  a dot, an L, a line, or a +. Keep going until you get a +.

Arrange the L to be facing the back and West sides, and the line to be horizontal
Do this pattern up to 3 times, rearranging as needed.

Front right.  
East up.  
Top right. 
East down.  
Top left.   
Front left.  

**The corners**

So now we've got a + on the bottom. What's next is absolutely random and I don't understand it but it works so let's go we're doing this together. We want exactly 1 yellow corner in place on the top, connected to the front and West sides. If there isn't one like this, put a yellow into the front side connected to the west and hope for the best.

East up.  
Front right.  
East down.  
Front right.  
East up.  
Front right x2. 
East down.  

Now if that worked first time thank the Lord Jesus because it's not common. If things aren't working out after a few attempts or there's no yellow corners in the correct way to try this just try something random and hope for the best.

**The bottom row corners**

The cube knows what you're doing at this point, so we have to be tricky. Try get the corners to be correct at the faces by rotating, if one of them is correct we're in luck. If not we just have to do this step once and one will pop up.

Put the side with the correct corners at the back, then do the following:

East down.  
Front right.  
East down.  
Back right x2.  

You should have 3 sets of 2 matching yellows arranged.

East up.   
Front left.  

This tricks the cube into thinking you'll attack with your line of 3, but you go backwards!

East down.  
Back left x2   
East up x2.   

If all done right you shouldn't have messed up your cube and corners are done. Repeat if you didn't have a correct corner set at the start

**Bottom row sides**

Wait, we're almost done???? That only took a year. Again if you have a correct side put it at the back. Check which direction you want to move the incorrect side at the front and do this process:

Front right 2.  (Turn front upside down).   
Top in the direction you want to move the square.   
West down.  
East down.  
Front right 2.  (Upside down again) 
East up.  
West up. 
Top in same direction as before.  
Front 2. 

And you're done if you had a side to begin with, repeat once more if not.

Maybe you run the games on some high end PC. As far as i am concerned,

1. Some Drivers like Nvidia are not giving optimal performances in their updates during the period in which they launched RTX support but it doesn't mean that they will continue to give worse performance in future updates. Updating Drivers also works if you use any other OS other than windows so the firmware of the Drivers also get updated as i use macOS on DualBoot
2. Nagle's Algorithm helps in every aspect, for example: it reduces the load of network during the gameplay from other system and application services.
3. Razer Cortex Helps in some ways, like killing the processes which aren't needed while you are gaming and Cleaning PC's Cache because everybody doesn't use CCleaner or Disk Cleanup Regularily.
4. Not everything is unnecessary in the post, I follow the ""If it helps in my PC, it will help on yours too""

We’re looking to adapt to a quicker control system with a larger level of intelligence, and it’s something that’s being prototyped and worked on right now (yay for different time zones and night owl developers). In the video you see there, there is a latency in communication signal response in the ballpark of 50-100ms delay, due to inefficiencies in coding, poor choice of communication protocols, etc. Fixing those issues alone has got us down to (I believe) sub 15ms responses, with an average of about 9ms? I’m more the mechanical and game design guy than the software and api and communications guy, so that number may not be perfect, but the effective ratio of change in response time is virtually the same. 

Additionally, we’ve better tuned the basic controls algorithm to make it tighter and more responsive. The better we get that, the better the system feels. I do know our first units to leave the building are walking oriented units with a speed limit of 4mph, which is enough to function for a really fast walk. That being said, the tech is very scalable, both in size and power output, so hitting the larger speed goals people want should be entirely feasible. And with regards to the acceleration mismatch: the motors respond to our speed command with almost perfect correlation (they match the command within 10 ms iirc), so it’s more a question of having a sophisticated enough system capable of detecting the user’s desired speed, which comes down to the more sophisticated tech we’re working on. Tl;dr, don’t worry too much, it should totally be accomplishable!

[],tegdoofiest,,,[],,,,text,t2_ipm2z,False,,"There's no real limit if you think of it as a single-line but you will hit timing and power issues. I have an LED strip in my computer and in my room with an ESP8266, I use an HTML page to change and control the colors and patterns. Both strips have 144 LEDs but one strip is 1m long and the other 3m. Too many LEDs means more processing so patterns start losing FPS transitions are more jittery. More LEDs also consume power so you need a larger power supply else the LEDs dim. Those are your basic upper-limits. Beyond that, it's up to the implementation on the Arduino. Most people use 1 data line for 1 row/column so you get limited to an 8x8. With multiplexing you may get 16x16. Above that like 24x24 or 32x32 you have to use serial data transfer or break large matrix into 2,4,8 smaller ones and have the arduino do the same processing but ""threaded"" for each submatrix. Based on my experiments an Atemga328 starts to slow down at 512 LEDs and stutter, at 32x32 the FPS drops to 10-15, and at 32x48 its like 1FPS. If you want good control for these array sizes you need a better micro like a Pi or FPGA. There are projects where people have made crazy 64x144 arrays of LED strips like a TV but they use an accessory driver board with an RPi to handle the data.

Multiple arduinos is a great idea but synchronization of the data being printed to the screen will be a headache as even if you send the same LED color data to all four at the same time the slightest differences in interrupts, processor speeds, and instructions will ruin synchronization after thousands or millions of iterations. I would think that after a few seconds of powered on you'll have all the arduinos doing different things. It is possible to have some sort of coherent data algorithm to sync all the arudinos when printing info, but I don't know how badly it would affect performance as now you're not pumping data to the LEDs as fast as you can but controlled by other arduinos lagging behind.",1564596726,{},evln6k8,False,t3_ck8qps,False,True,t1_evlgxv9,/r/gaming/comments/ck8qps/guy_turns_his_bookshelf_into_a_giant_version_of/evln6k8/,1564597928.0,1,True,,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,0.0,1564597162.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From what I searched online, Usenet providers are around $8 a month whilst a 4tb hard drive on Amazon costs close to $100. So, the costs match up with what you would pay for a couple of services at a time.

For me, I share everything with my family (6 users out of whom 4 are very active). It makes more sense to have Netflix, Prime and Crave (Canadian combo of Hulu, Showtime and HBO). Total cost is $17/mon (I utilize deals from my ISP plus Prime Student).

[],danhakimi,,TheWire1,[],,,dark,text,t2_4d0ul,False,,"&gt;First, are you comparing Google's public, free products to a proprietary product?

Google's ""public, free products"" are mostly proprietary, and, despite being miles ahead of Netflix's recommendation AI, still aren't good.

&gt;Second, yes I use them. The image recognition is pretty good, the news recommendation is on point, maps is frighteningly good, and Youtube is crap. But of course that's just my personal experience, yours is probably different.

From an AI-related perspective, I agree with one of these.

&gt;And a person is unique, but people are not. Categorization works,

Wrong. Categorization is an *okay* heuristic for *some* purposes, but by and large, it's a lot shittier than people think.

&gt;there's no need of ML to know that. Ads have been relying on categorization (demo) for years, politic messaging rely on categorization. You may be unique, but there are many like you.

Categorization is marginally better than one-size-fits-all advertising. That doesn't mean it can accurately predict subscribing habits in the way you described. It just means that it *isn't completely useless*.

&gt;All of the elements you're referring to, viewing actions, release dates, actors, budgets, how many episodes in the season, the length of the episodes, are there a major event in real life at the sale time of a release, and many others, are just variables. Variables that can be computed, if not on their own, then aggregated with other variables.

I didn't refer to the length of the episodes or budgets or episode counts. The elements I referred to were mostly not quantifiable.

Although, now that you mention it, perhaps a show goes poorly, but the showrunner says ""hey, we're sci-fi, give us a real budget and let us soar."" Or a show goes well, but not well enough to justify its budget, and the showrunner suggests a much lower budget for the second season.

Or a show loses a star and your algorithm can't tell whether that star was a net value for the price because your algorithm only has one show's data as a data point on that actor, and there are obviously too many other factors involved in that show. ML needs a lot of data, and if you're just measuring demographics and shows watched, you're going to be really limited in the amount of data you actually have available to you. Now, you'll probably have other data supplementing your data, like how hot an actor is on google, or instagram, or what have you, but you sure as fuck don't have the oracle you're pretending you have, especially for new actors.

Or your show loses a shitty actor who was a decent fit for the role or integral to the plot. Last I checked, ML still can't tell which characters are integral to the plot, or shit like that -- that's a creative task, now isn't it?

And at the end of the day, a lot of ML results are kind of black box answers -- it's hard, if possible, to track the inner workings of ML algorithms. So if there's a factor you think it might have weighted incorrectly, tough shit, you'll never know.",1565110079,{},ew4gf1m,False,t3_cmda2p,False,True,t1_ew4dymt,/r/television/comments/cmda2p/the_oa_canceled_after_two_seasons_at_netflix/ew4gf1m/,1565110082.0,1,True,,False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],danhakimi,,TheWire1,[],,,dark,text,t2_4d0ul,False,,"First of all, there are factors here more than what type of viewer watches what type of show and what his subscribing habits are. There is the way release dates interact. Perhaps two shows had one effect when they were released together, but their newer seasons won't come out at the same time, because one necessarily takes a lot longer, or because a smart exec realized that they would be more effective if intentionally staggered. Or maybe there was a scandal involving one of the actors. Or maybe this season sucked because it was setting up next season's plot, and you can tell that they're going to be able to bring their audience back.

Second of all, categorization of people is a fool's errand. People are different and their viewing patterns are unique. Machine learning isn't nearly as good in practice as business execs like to pretend it is. Have you tried using Google products lately? They make shitty fucking recommendations, and they're *Google*. Now go to Netflix and Hulu and see the garbage they recommend to you ""because you watched."" Even the shows I actually watched and liked don't lead to good recommendations, but they also think I enjoyed a show when I watched it for three minutes and stopped. Gee, why the fuck do you think I stopped that fast?

And what's more, they're not really deciding whether one particular show is worth renewing, but how to best maximize their portfolio given release dates, and things like that. Sometimes a show seems profitable in a vacuum, but you need your portfolio to do something different.

And none of that really addresses growth, and the problem of appealing to people who your algorithm hasn't categorized yet.

You can be non-pc and compassionate

Patrice o neal was very un-pc but man he loved life and loved people. He'd annoy the hell out more than a few but it always came from a place of love and joy.

The problem is when people weaponise a natural emotion and try to make it artificially enforced. It just doesn't work well

The reality is that progress comes mostly  not from people changing their minds but from the generation in power simply being one with the updated status quo

If youre a person growing up today and you're simply just used to lgbtq neighbours in your neighbourhood you're unlikely to have a problem with it

Most progress is from the update of the status quo with new births. 


Of the people that change 
There's basically three ways people update their views.


One: they make friends/fall in love with someone from the group their ambivalent towards or one of their loved ones like a sibling  does. Cognitive dissonance causes a cascade effect. And it may take time for changes to occur. Example: I'm British born Indian, if I had a white girlfriend or wife it might be bit awkward for relatives to accept but if I had kids they would want access to seeing them and kids have a tendency to melt bigotry in people. 

Two: trade and commerce  usually makes people of disparate and separate cultures come together and intermingle

Three: someone from whatever community they have a problem with does something genuinely nice and kind for them or people they love and it updates their views. 


Phrasing things as ""yeah we're doing this not only can you not stop us but we're going to punish you for your dinosaur views"" doesn't actually change hearts and minds and it never will

Often pc tends to be ignorance of how slow updating people's views are.

Low ratings means unhappy advertisers means lower rents the following season. But a streaming network simply has to give subscribers more reasons to stay subscribed. Peacock will need as much content as possible so the 3-4 million people that watched it as it aired live could be very valuable to them. 

Now there are other reasons why this might not be possible.

&gt;Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computer systems, as opposed to the hardware side that computer engineers mainly focus on (although there is overlap). Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas (such as algorithm and data structure development and design, software engineering, information theory, database theory, computational complexity theory, numerical analysis, programming language theory, computer graphics, and computer vision), their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman  
&gt;While working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under Gerry Sussman, Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI truth maintenance system, called dependency-directed backtracking. This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems. As of 2009, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking. The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.

* Young women are especially at risk.
* 82% of all juvenile victims are female. 90% of adult rape victims are female.
* Females ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault.

Another example (classic Boston Housing example) given a bunch of data about houses and the prices that they sold for build a model which can predict the price a house will sell for. You have age of the house, number of bedrooms, sq ft of front yard, sq ft of back yard and a whole bunch more factors.

 Lets talk about climate science fraud. There was a discussion once concerning Michael Mann. I believe he once was party to a conversation where the Medieval Warm period was regarded as a problem because it showed warmer temperatures than the present. 

Shortly thereafter he created a study that got rid of the MWP. 

He had this study presented as a graph on the front of an IPCC report. People wondered why the IPCC would go from a reort that showed the MWP to one that suddenly did not.

People asked for the data and algorithms that were used in this report.Mann refused to show them.. You know sort of like you when you copy answers off another person's test paper. 

Mann had his ass called before Congress and it was determined that he would not re;ease the information there either. The persons looking into his work were able to determine that he both used data that skewed the results to make the MWP disappear, AND used math equations that did the same. It was a big shitshow with Mann repeatedly claiming that he came by his results honestly.

Consensus: Mann then tried to claim to be cleared by consensus.He set about with a group of cohorts to get a number of them to repeat the experiment using his same banned proxies and same improper math operations. 

Why do I say banned? Because the National Academy of Science reviewed his sources and made the claim that they should never be used in temperature reconstructions because they did not indicate temperature change but instead showed moisture change.

And MANN knew it. He had been warned at one point that tree ring cores were not proper for this use by an arborist.

Yet Mann gathered all these allies to repeat the same fraudulent process and they obliged printing out study after study claiming to have found a hockeystick shape. 

Mann himself tried to repeat his folly. He again used the banned tree ring proxies and said See? the same result!
When called on this he then tried  to do the same without the tree rings. He failed. So he looked for a proxy that was not a tree ring. Mia Tiljander had a sediment proxy from Korrtajarvi that she had used in a study. Mann wanted to use it because by looking at it he could see that the shape would result in a hockeystick. Mainly because he had an algorithm that would multiply that proxy by 300 times and override other neutral proxies. 

SO he used it but Ms. Tiljander warned him that one end of the proxy was contaminated and should not be used for his purposes. 

What was a poor dishonest climate scientist to do?????

 He had to clear his name!!! He determined that the proxy could be used upside down and give the same result....So that is what he did. his destroyed the timeline accuracy of the study but Mann had his hockeystick shape back.

Gavin Schmidt at RealClimate was the point man for defending Mann. After it was pointed out repeatedly in print at that blogsite Schmidt quit discussing Mann and his frauds. The damage to the other climatologists and the reputation of the site was getting larger and larger.
 To This day Mann pushes the use of these banned proxies . PAGES 2K and PAGES 2017 are using them blindly although NAS still prohibits them for temperature reconstructions.

I guess the REAL CONSENSUS is that you can lie and cheat over and over in producing a study if your buddies go along.

That is the real truth. A PAL reviewed paper is woth more than a true PEER reviewed paper.

&gt;&gt;We actually eliminate records with negative correlations (this is mentioned breifly in the GRL article,), and we investigated a variety of weighting schemes to assure the basic robustness of the composite--but I certainly endorse your broader point here. Many of these records have some significant uncertainties or possible sources of bias, and this isn't the place to get into that. [Michael Mann]

The GRL article referred to there is [Mann and Jones 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL017814). They checked proxy records for validity by checking them against directly measured temperatures in the same region for the period from 1901–1980. As they say there, ""Proxy records exhibiting negative or approximately zero local correlations (SH record #2 and #3) were eliminated from further consideration in the study."" If the proxy record doesn't correspond to actual measured temperatures, then obviously it's not a reliable dataset - so it makes sense not to use it. What's the problem?

&gt;&gt;Phil, Here are some speculations on correcting SSTs to partly explain the 1940s warming blip. If you look at the attached plot you will see that the land also shows the 1940s blip (as I'm sure you know). So, if we could reduce the ocean blip by, say, 0.15 degC, then this would be significant for the global mean -- but we'd still have to explain the land blip. I've chosen 0.15 here deliberately.

This is referring to an issue that had recently been pointed out by [Thompson et al. 2008](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06982), which detected a clear discontinuity in the temperature record which indicated that there was a measurement artifact in sea surface temperatures that hadn't been accounted for. When there is evidence for a sudden change in the temperature record that is likely due to artificial things like changes in measurement techniques, they try to find the explanation for that change. For example, it was determined that the SST ""blip"" was due to a shift from ""bucket"" measurements to measurements from ship engine intakes - which introduced a slight bias.

The illegally hacked emails provided a lot of fodder for “skeptics” to take quotes out of context, but they didn’t really show that the researchers faked results, or conducted any other form of scientific fraud. Multiple investigations into the emails and the accusations that resulted from them found no wrongdoing by the researchers. You can read the reports yourself:

[],hurtsdonut_,,,[],,,,text,t2_hyzbb,False,,"Imma just respond to myself with this thought of Trump.

""A few things spring to mind.

Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem.

For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace - all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump's limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing - not once, ever.

I don't say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility - for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.

But with Trump, it's a fact. He doesn't even seem to understand what a joke is - his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.

Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.

And scarily, he doesn't just talk in crude, witless insults - he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.

There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It's all surface.

Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.

Well, we don't. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.

And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.

Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.

He's not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.

He's more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.

And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.

That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.

There are unspoken rules to this stuff - the Queensberry rules of basic decency - and he breaks them all. He punches downwards - which a gentleman should, would, could never do - and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless - and he kicks them when they are down.

So the fact that a significant minority - perhaps a third - of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think 'Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy' is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:

• Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.

• You don't need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.

This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.

After all, it's impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.

God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.

He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.

In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws - he would make a Trump.

A COMPUTATIONAL TASK TO
DEMONSTRATE QUANTUM SUPREMACY
To demonstrate quantum supremacy, we compare our
quantum processor against state-of-the-art classical com-
puters in the task of sampling the output of a pseudo-
random quantum circuit[24{26]. Random circuits are a
suitable choice for benchmarking since they do not pos-
sess structure and therefore allow for limited guarantees
of computational hardness[24, 25, 27, 28]. We design the
circuits to entangle a set of quantum bits (qubits) by re-
peated application of single-qubit and two-qubit logical
operations. Sampling the quantum circuit’s output pro-
duces a set of bitstrings, e.g. f0000101, 1011100, ...g.
Due to quantum interference, the probability distribution
of the bitstrings resembles a speckled intensity pattern
produced by light interference in laser scatter, such that
some bitstrings are much more likely to occur than oth-
ers. Classically computing this probability distribution
becomes exponentially more dicult as the number of
qubits (width) and number of gate cycles (depth) grows.
We verify that the quantum processor is working prop-
erly using a method called cross-entropy benchmarking
(XEB) [24, 26], which compares how often each bitstring
is observed experimentally with its corresponding ideal
probability computed via simulation on a classical com-
puter. For a given circuit, we collect the measured bit-
strings fx
igand compute the linear XEB delity [24{
26, 29], which is the mean of the simulated probabilities
of the bitstrings we measured:
F
XEB = 2
nhP(x
i)i
i 1 (1)
where nis the number of qubits, P(x
i) is the probability
of bitstring x
i computed for the ideal quantum circuit,
and the average is over the observed bitstrings. Intu-
itively, F
XEB is correlated with how often we sample high
probability bitstrings. When there are no errors in the
quantum circuit, sampling the probability distribution
will produce F
XEB = 1. On the other hand, sampling
from the uniform distribution will give hP(x
i)i
i = 1=2n
and produce F
XEB = 0. Values of F

1 correspond to the probability that no error has oc-
curred while running the circuit. The probabilities P(x
i)
must be obtained from classically simulating the quan-
tum circuit, and thus computing F
XEB is intractable in
the regime of quantum supremacy. However, with certain
circuit simplications, we can obtain quantitative delity
estimates of a fully operating processor running wide and
deep quantum circuits.
Our goal is to achieve a high enough F
XEB for a circuit
with sucient width and depth such that the classical
computing cost is prohibitively large. This is a dicult
task because our logic gates are imperfect and the quan-
tum states we intend to create are sensitive to errors. A
single bit or phase
ip over the course of the algorithm
will completely shue the speckle pattern and result in
close to 0 delity [24, 29]. Therefore, in order to claim
quantum supremacy we need a quantum processor that

[],EightEqualsEqualsDe,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzg5t,False,,"Alright check this out. Normal (classical computers) got these things called bits. Their a bit, because they're a bit of information. What is a bit? A bit can be thought of as a tiny little electric thingy, if it has enough electric shit (or rather, voltage) then it can complete some arbitrary circuit. Let's call this 1. If it's low voltage, we can call it zero. The bit of information, is if it's a 1 or a 0.

Now, 0s and 1s aren't that interesting, but what you do with them is. There are tiny circuits built with logic gates. A logic gates takes some number of bits as inputs, and spits out some other bit or bits as output . It takes a lot of logic gates to hardware a circuit to perform some function, but doing something like making a calculator can be done in a day.

In the case of a calculator, I have two bits as input, and two bits as output. (This is important later for understanding key properties of QC)
If my two bits are 0,0. My output is 0+0 = 0 with a carry out of 0. If I add 1 + 1, I don't get 2, there is no 2 in binary. I get 1 with a carry out of 1.

2 bits as input, 2 bits as output. You now have a basic adder. You can make more complex computer stuff now.

That's the basic of how a classical computer works. You got tiny bits of information, and circuits which give the basics of input and output. 

A quantum computer (QC) has qubits, instead of bits. They are quantum binary digits. This part I'm just going to have to lay down as fact. I can write more on the physical fundamentals later. But, you know how some people like to get philosophical, all like ""is reality deterministic and everything I'll ever do can be calculated or do I have free will?"" Well, on the Quantum level, reality is not deterministic, but probabilistic. True, genuine, unpredictable, randomness is at the core of nature. But what is this randomness centered around, what is random?

So, in classical computers my bit of information is how much potential (voltage) I have. You can think of it as a tiny device measuring energy, and Making a cutoff decision. There's enough energy so this bit is 0 or 1.

In basic quantum mechanics(QM), these are the four things you can measure: Position, Time, (when and where something is), Energy, and Speed (technically momentum). 

So in QM, things are probablistic. The things I measure, have probabilities. It's not a definite location I measure, but I construct an equation describing the probability distribution, and can tell you what the average position will be if I run the experiment a fuck ton of times. However, individual runs may still be very, very far from the theoretical average. Here's the fucky part though, that thing your measuring, that bit or electron or any really really tiny enough thing to make it a quanta of something, exists in every single unique probability until you measure it. It's weird, like nature's playing peek-a-boo with reality. But until you measure that thing , it's in all the states of whatever it could be after you measure it - before you measure it. After you measure it, it picks one of those states, according to your distribution.

Why is this important for QC? Okay, so our bits of information are probablistic in nature. There's some special logic gates for QC, one such is a haddamard gate (further reading on your own). If I don't force a measurement, I can keep playing with these quantum states, changing their probability distributions, and when I'm all done I can ""measure"" my qbit as input to some basic circuit to do basic math or whatever. A qbit can do the same shit a bit does, but that's sorta wasteful. Let a qbit do quantum probability stuff.

Here's the kicker though. Remember the basic adder from above? Two bits as input, two bits as output. 4 unique entries (0+0, 0+1, 1+0, 1+1). If I have more bits as input and output, I can do more addition.

In QC,my bits are probabilistic. Not only that, but until I measure it, it's in a probablistic combination of all possible states. There's a 100% chance it's in 1 state out of all states.  Let's say I have 1 qbits as input, written as

.25*|0&gt; + .75|1&gt;

That means I have a 25 percent chance being a 0, the rest 1. Maybe I can add that bit with itself. Then there are four states the output could be.

|00&gt;

|01&gt;

|10&gt;

|11&gt;

And let's say the all have 25% probability, for now, just for ease of writing I'm on mobile. 
Each of those output bits, have an associated probability. But it only takes 2 bits encode all 4 of those possibilities. If I wanted to add those two together, I would need 3 bits to encode all 8 probabilities. But I only ever have to do the math on 1 bit, to get the results from adding 4 unique combinations. Or do the math on 2 bits to get the results from adding all 8 combinations. it's exponential growth, adding just 1 tiny qbit is like adding the effect of ALL THE QBITS before it. Everytime you add 1qbit, that's the effect you're feeling.

Now, no one wants to be 78% certain on what 2+2 is, QC is not meant for these types of tasks. What they're excellent at is computing probabilities, simulating certain systems, and my favorite: function inversion. Check out the Wikipedia page on grovers algorithm, it's pretty cool. Basically, you can think of it as a huge speed up in finding a needle in a haystack, or searching for anything inside an ordered list of things. Like finding a number inside a database.

What you probably wanted to say is along these lines:

- Some encryption protocols are based on public-key algorithms, which can be efficiently broken by a sufficiently strong hypothetical quantum computer. The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorisation problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm. (from wiki)

- If this hypothetical computer is successful, most if not all the algorithms used in encryption today will become obsolete. (and yes, if you'd be able to intercept someone's communication with Facebook, you'd probably be able to decrypt and read that communication). The protocol upon which the encrypted data is transferred should have no impact on possible decryption.

However most people think these things are difficult to work with. They actually aren't. It's just a slightly modified grammar from the math most people know. I will describe it here on the off chance. Let's break down this simple L system to get at the fundamentals.


Axiom
f -&gt; f+f+f+f
Rotational increment in degrees
90

f -&gt; ff+f--fFff
f -&gt; fFff--f+ff

Ok that looks intimidating right. Here is what this algorithm / set of instructions do. The Axiom is the starting line. It is in a way the overall shape of the thing. 

The -&gt; which can be easily made on most keyboards means turns into. 

A lowercase f like so means draw a line.

An uppercase F means draw a blank line.

The + and - symbols tells the line how to turn. I'm trying to work this out in my head but I think + means go left, and - means go right.

So you start at the top axium and it says to draw f, well what does f mean in an axiom why is it a special f. That f is the leader of all of the other f's

First to choose which string to follow label one heads, and the other tails. Then flip a coin, and follow that path

So that leads us to the first line of the body of the f system.

 This translates as.

Draw 2 lines go left draw another line , and on and on.

No, that is not what discrete means. Discrete means non-continuous. Simple example: the function f(x)=2x is certainly not discrete, but it certainly uses fixed inputs - presumable real numbers in this case.

Right... **No**. You can always predict the result of f(x)=2x but that doesn't have discrete inputs. It is a deterministic problem with non-discrete inputs.

&gt;A RNG is not truly random 

Either we are for some incomprehensible reason suddenly talking about modern or obsolete implementations of random number generators or you're wrong.

&gt;Every part of the RNG uses discrete inputs at every stage

Of what RNG? I can certainly describe an algorithm that generates pseudo-random numbers (like the ones you describe) from non-discrete inputs and I'm not particularly smart. **Why are we now talking about this?!?**

&gt;And if you were god you would know all the inputs and be able to predict the output of the RNG.

Not in this universe but I want to mention that I have no idea why we are talking about determinism now. Do you just admit that you were completely wrong about everything in your previou comment and would like to move on to an entirely unrelated topic but also save face? You could have just asked!

&gt;If you think somehow the brain operates in a mystical fashion and doesn't use discrete values in its logic gates and doesn't have deterministic outputs, unlike every single other natural process we have come to understand, you'd have to explain why and give some kind of proof. 

I am not interested in this discussion and that is something I never claimed. I will also not make a claim either way now because in the end I just don't know and I'm not stupid and arrogant enough to pretend I do in the abscence of adequate scientific evidence.

&gt;Literally every macro sized process we have ever come to understand has proven to involve discrete values and deterministic outputs. 

This is technically false but practically partially true. I'm not sure it's worth explaining to you how probabilities work though. I've ""lost interest"" in doing so.

&gt; The discovery, made with NASA&amp;#039;s Hubble Space Telescope, serves as the first detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of such a planet.

&gt; Because the new-found planet is believed to have a solid surface, and it&amp;#039;s known to have an extended atmosphere with at least some water vapor, researchers say it&amp;#039;s feasible that K2-18 b could actually be a water world with a global ocean covering its entire surface.

&gt; Thanks to a sophisticated algorithm, the researchers were able to tease out the undeniable signal of water vapor in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, But they couldn&amp;#039;t tell exactly how much water vapor is really there.

* Hundreds of human rights lawyers (not even dissidents, just the LAWYERS who defended people) were snatched by gestapo all over China in what is known as the [709 Crackdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/709_crackdown).

* One of those lawyers, Wang Quanzhang was [sentenced to 4.5 years](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/wang-quanzhang-china-sentences-human-rights-lawyer-to-four-years-in-prison) for ""subversion of state power"". But that's not enough. China actually [went after Wang's 6-year-old son](https://chinachange.org/2019/09/06/imprisoned-lawyer-wang-quanzhangs-six-year-old-son-once-again-forced-out-of-school/), forcing him out of his school and banning any other school from taking him in.

* A dissident, [Wang Bingzhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Bingzhang_(dissident\)) was kidnapped by Chinese agents in Vietnam and sentenced to life in prison after a closed trial that lasted 1 day.

* A man wore a t-shirt with the word ""Xitler"" on it and [was disappeared](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/11/03/young-chinese-activist-missing-after-sharing-plan-to-wear-xitler-t-shirt-on-cpc-anniversary-report/). Eventually he was [tried for ""subversion of state power"" while barred from meeting with lawyers](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/02/15/chinese-xitler-activist-trial-subversion-lawyers-barred-seeing/)

* Another man, [Wang Meiyu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/death-of-chinese-activist-in-police-custody-prompts-calls-for-investigation-into-torture) hold up a placard calling for Xi’s resignation &amp; democracy. He was arrested for ""picking quarrels”. He ended up dead in custody.

* A woman live streamed herself [splashing ink on a Xi poster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sF34fJwh0). She was [disappeared](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-woman-dong-yaoqiong-disappears-spraying-ink-xi-jinping-a8455166.html). Her last social media update: *""Right now there are a group of people wearing uniforms outside my door. I’ll go out after I change my clothes. I did not commit a crime. The people and groups that hurt me are the ones who are guilty""*. Later on there was report of her being [sent to a psychiatric hospital](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/23/chinese-protester-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-poster-sent-psychiatric-hospital-report/)

* After the ink-splash woman's disappearance her father made a series of broadcast to call attention to her plight. He ended up getting [taken away by the police in the middle of a live stream](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/14/police-interrupt-youtube-live-stream-father-missing-chinese-woman-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-photo/)

* 5 people associated with a Hong Kong bookstore that sold titles such as ""*Xi Jinping and His Six Women*"" were [disappeared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances). Only one managed to escape back to HK. He held a press briefing to tell the world about his kidnapping by China. He's now in exile in Taiwan. The other 4 are still somewhere in China.

And, of course

* [1.5 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-rights/15-million-muslims-could-be-detained-in-chinas-xinjiang-academic-idUSKCN1QU2MQ) - [3 millions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/04/us-accuses-china-of-using-concentration-camps-uighur-muslim-minority) Uyghurs rounded up in concentration camps

* [Leaked footage](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/d722aw/chinas_detention_of_uighurs_video_of_blindfolded/) of a large number of blindfolded Uyghurs shackled together

* A Canadian journalist [wanted to debunk reports of Chinese anti-Muslim repression so he went on a stage-managed show tour put on by China](https://nationalpost.com/news/canadian-went-to-china-to-debunk-reports-of-anti-muslim-repression-but-was-shocked-by-treatment-of-uyghurs). That means he only saw a fake Potemkin village that China actually thought was acceptable by Western standard. But the brutality of even this fake Potemkin village stunned him. Now imagine what's really happening in the real concentration camps where millions of Uyghurs are being held. Imagine how bad the true situation is.

* Using minorities &amp; political prisoners as [free organ farms](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c1my5j/china_is_harvesting_organs_from_detainees_uk/). A doctor's [eye witness account](https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/chinese-dissidents-are-being-executed-for-their-organs-former-hospital-worker-says/): *'The prisoner was brought in, tied hand and foot, but very much alive. The army doctor in charge sliced him open from chest to belly button and exposed his two kidneys. Then the doctor ordered Zheng to remove the man’s eyeballs. Hearing that, the dying prisoner gave him a look of sheer terror, and Zheng froze. “I can’t do it,” he told the doctor, who then quickly scooped out the man’s eyeballs himself.'*

* Call for [retraction of 400 Chinese scientific papers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/06/call-for-retraction-of-400-scientific-papers-amid-fears-organs-came-from-chinese-prisoners) amid fears organs came from Chinese prisoners

* [15 Chinese studies retracted](https://www.newscientist.com/article/15-15-studies-retracted-due-to-fears-they-used-chinese-prisoners-organs/) due to fears they used Chinese prisoners' organs

* [Cultural genocide (and organ harvests, of course)](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/china-uyghur-muslim-rules-laws-treatment-chinese-human-rights-religion-a8534161.html). A uyghur's testimony: *""First, children were stopped from learning about the Quran, then from going to mosques. It was followed by bans on ramadan, growing beards, giving Islamic names to your baby, etc. Then our language was attacked – we didn’t get jobs if we didn’t know Mandarin. Our passports were collected, we were told to spy on each other, innocent Uyghur prisoners were killed for organ harvesting""*

* China is moving beyond Uyghur and cracking down on its model minority Hui Muslim. ['Afraid We Will Become The Next Xinjiang': China's Hui Muslims Face Crackdown](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763356996/afraid-we-will-become-the-next-xinjiang-chinas-hui-muslims-face-crackdown): *""The same restrictions that preceded the Xinjiang crackdown on Uighur Muslims are now appearing in Hui-dominated regions.

I think instead the government should create a regulation platform for credit agencies where they must follow certain principles to be allowed to operate as such including:

* No medical debt.

* Full transparency on how credit scores are scored -- perhaps even being required to use a government sanctioned algorithm.

* Free credit reports to consumers and other tooling.

* Must provide free counselling and support to consumers.

* May make profit from government grants + charging businesses for report access.

* Must offer ways to notify consumers when their reports have been accessed, by who, and when, and allow consumer to revoke and remove access at will.

The problem is that a lot of black-box credit score statistics based on real world data, without incorporating race into the model (of course),  end up being racially or otherwise biased.    If you make the algorithm optimal and accurate, this will continue, if there are real underlying effects.

For example, maybe poor people who moved to the middle class  haven't had experience in financial matters, so despite a decent income, are more likely to get into financial problems.

&gt; Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders wants to eliminate the private credit reporting companies and substitute them with a government-managed credit registry.

&gt; According to Sanders&amp;#039; campaign, the new system would use a &amp;quot;Transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores&amp;quot; and allows Americans to access their credit scores for free.

&gt; &amp;quot;Credit reporting companies don&amp;#039;t have a financial incentive to improve accuracy,&amp;quot; said Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning policy group Demos, which has advocated for a public credit registry.

[],PlayfulStill,,,[],,,,text,t2_3mzzhcc3,False,,"Hidden at the bottom of presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’s plan to erase Americans’ medical debt is a proposal that would replace a roughly $10 billion private credit reporting industry — populated by companies like Equifax, Experian and Transunion — with a public, free credit registry.

The plan calls for a creating a “secure public credit registry,” in place of the current for-profit credit reporting agencies, that would use “a public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores.”

Under this proposal, Americans would be able to receive credit scores for free, and medical debt would be excluded from credit scores. Sanders’s campaign also calls for ending the use of credit scores for rental housing, employment, and insurance. According to the campaign, the public credit registry would be housed in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The idea, which has been promoted by think tanks like Demos, is aimed at increasing regulation and reducing systematic racial discrimination within the current credit score system. Activists believe implementing such a regulation would protect consumers from predatory practices and privacy violations, while also making lending and access to capital more equitable.

Sanders proposal would be a significant change in how Americans find out their creditworthiness in the United States — and how that credit score can be used.

This is a major shift in how credit scoring works
Currently, three major companies run the credit reporting industry: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax. They collect lending and payment data, like medical debt information from collecting agencies, mortgage payments, and student loans and credit card payments without consumer’s permission. They then charge consumers to see the score (except once a year, when legally you can get your report for free). And as Vox’s Karen Turner reported, companies like Equifax are not incentivized to prioritize privacy; in 2016, Equifax spent $1.1 million lobbying against regulatory laws, including around data security and transparency.

That lobbying has been largely successful, but has left consumers in danger of privacy breaches. Millions of Americans are continuing to deal with the fallout from Equifax’s major data breach in 2017, which left 143 million customers’ personal information — including their social security numbers and financial records — at risk. Equifax took six weeks to inform customers of the data breach.

CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) report after CFPB report has highlighted the industry’s shady practices — from complaints that credit reports were inaccurate, with little recourse for consumers to fix them, to credit reporting agencies selling consumers misleading credit-monitoring services, and selling scores to consumers that weren’t even used by banks or other lenders making credit decisions.

And numerous studies have shown that the current credit scoring model continues to reflect and exacerbate existing racial disparities by limiting Americans’ ability to secure rental housing, impacting the cost of insurance, and so forth. Not only do credit score models categorize more black and Latino Americans as higher-risk loan seekers compared to white Americans, but a large share of people of color are “credit invisible,” without enough credit history to show to acquire loans.

Sanders sees the credit industry as part of Americans’ medical debt problem because of the impact those debts have on credit scores. And many Americans are affected by the issue: In 2014, 43 million Americans had unpaid medical debts on their credit reports, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and these debts also disproportionately impacts black adults.

CFPB, the federal regulator, has slapped fines on these companies for years for these practices. Sanders proposal takes it one step further: it cuts the for-profit credit reporting companies out completely.",1569128845,{},f11pry5,False,t3_d7db8q,False,True,t3_d7db8q,/r/politics/comments/d7db8q/bernie_sanders_wants_to_put_credit_reporting/f11pry5/,1569131119.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet you insist on not looking closely at the data, it appears. The study mentions that performing worse than expected would constitute a negative article. Hillary lost a whole lot more states than anyone expected so there were a slew of ""negative"" articles throughout the primary. Then there's also the problem that the study relies on an algorithm that we can't verify ourselves so it's hard to judge on the results.

* Significantly limit the contact attempts per week a collector can make to an individual through any mode of communication, regardless of how many bills are in collection.

* Substantially limit the assets that can be seized and the wages that can be garnished in collection to ensure consumers do not lose their homes, jobs, or primary vehicles and will be able to financially support their families. 
* Instruct the IRS to review the billing and collection practices of the nearly 3,000 non-profit hospitals to ensure they are in line with the charitable care standards for non-profit tax status, and take action against those who are not.
* Eliminate means testing requirements to file for bankruptcy.
* Allow for the adjudication — including potential discharge — of debt, including interest and penalties, stemming from direct payments to providers and insurers for medical expenses. Assuming documentation, this includes medical debt incurred on credit cards or any other consumer debt product.
* End the onerous and regressive “credit counseling” required before filing to discharge medical debt.
* Include broad “automatic stay” protections, placing an immediate prohibition on any evictions, utility (heat, electric, etc.) interruptions, foreclosure proceedings, wage garnishments, driver's license suspensions, and other actions.
* Prohibit requiring the disclosure of medical debt discharge on housing, loan, or other applications.
* Remove and exclude medical debt from existing credit reports.
* Create a secure public credit registry to replace for-profit credit reporting agencies.
* This registry will use a public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores.

“One of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'” -Mitch McConnell. That isn’t “they simply didn’t like his choices”.

&gt;Untrue. It is a majority of states controlled chamber. That does not necessarily mean it will always be minority as a whole of population.

Of course. In a world with more than 2 parties in control that might be a reality, but the world we live in is that the senate tilts hard to the minority. That may not always be the case, but it is now. 

&gt;Except it's exactly the point of the Senate. To ignore the reasonings and cry foul that it's not PV elected is to ignore the very reason it exists. To say or suggest they should be electedthrough PV, is to say it shouldn't exist at all.

And now you contradict yourself.

I think some wires are being crossed, so let me be precise with what I’m advocating.

- US House is gerrymander free. Idc how this happens, we absolutely need to increase the cap of reps because you’re right, having a margin of ~500k - ~1m is not acceptable. I don’t think it does nearly as much damage as gerrymandering, especially in local elections, but it’s still wrong. The extra safeguards can be MMP, a third party council, the UN, an algorithm I don’t actually give a shit, gerrymandering shouldn’t be a thing. 
- The senate exactly the way it is, but hard coded vote thresholds. I’m talking 2/3rds majority vote required for all judicial appointments, and simple majority for presidential appointments. This would completely remove the ability for activist judges to be appointed barring an absolute blowout, and the president can still try to do what the people voted them in to do. There should be some temperament for the executive branch anyway, considering legislating via the executive is ethically garbage. 
- The president is elected via PV. They represent America, much the same a governor or senator represents their state. For internal affairs, they’ll be generally tempered via the senate. Foreign affairs would be fair game outside of wars. With a PV president we’d never again have a president representing a minority of Americans telling our most valued allies to go fuck themselves against the majority’s will. I also think that tariffs as a presidential power should be removed entirely, that’s just straight up a shitty idea.

Here are some other things to do to make congress function better:

Give citizens vouchers that they can use to donate to campaigns so that politicians don't have to look for money and then votes.

Increase the number of senators from 2 per state to 3 per state so that people can elect a senator every 2 years instead of 2 years then 4 years.

Use the cube root rule and increase the house size from 435 to 676. The cube root rule is where the number of representatives is set as the cube root of the general population. Adopting such a rule would automatically deal with apportionments and make it less political.

All of biology?

It's pretty well understood that human sexuality is biologically driven even if scientists haven't quite grasped the specific genetic, biological, or physiological mechanisms at play.

Human sexuality, including homosexuality, has existed as long as humans. If it was a learned behavior, wouldn't we have seen some variation in it's prevalence over time?

And who exactly are homosexuals learning it from? What specific external stimuli are homosexuals reacting to in which homosexuality is the outcome? Some of the most damning, I believe, evidence that homosexuality is not learned is that the [overwhelming majority of children of homosexual partners, where nurturing of homosexuality would seem most likely, are heterosexual.](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting-full.pdf)

Homosexuality has been practiced in all societies, ones that have been completely isolated from each other in time, geography, language, and culture. That level of coincidence isn't feasible without, at least, innate underpinnings for homosexuality.

There has also been twin studies that have indicated a genetic basis for homosexuality. Although no ""gay gene"" has been located, there have been associations observed [""with regions of Chromosome 8, the Xq28 locus on the X chromosome, and other sites across many chromosomes.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) In fact, 9 areas within the genome have been found to have strong association with homosexuality to the point that sexual orientation can be predicted via algorithm in control groups at a rate of 70%.

We also have homosexual behavior in a plethora of isolated non-human animal species, that could not have learned it. Although the absolute extent of homosexual behavior in non-human animals is unknown, it has been observed as widespread among social birds and mammals, notably among sea mammals and primates. Biologist Bruce Bagemihl asserts that homosexual behavior [""has been documented in over 450 species of animals worldwide.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals) Whereas zoologist Petter Bøckman has stated [""No species has been found in which homosexual behaviour has not been shown to exist, with the exception of species that never have sex at all...""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals#Research)",1568516564,{},f0amzgp,False,t3_d48v28,False,True,t1_f08qdkz,/r/politics/comments/d48v28/mike_pence_said_in_the_1990s_that_being_gay_was_a/f0amzgp/,1568516590.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; The four Republicans sent a letter to Zuckerberg claiming that the fact-check was “performed by two pro-abortion activists with significant ties to to abortion-rights advocacy organization, both of whom are paid to perform abortions.” 

&gt; [Facebook]: ""We have been in touch with the IFCN which has opened an investigation to determine whether the fact checkers who rated this content did so by following procedures designed to ensure impartiality,"" a company spokesman told the outlet.

&gt; The IFCN said in a statement that it will review materials related to the fact-check and determine if anything violated its code of conduct.

International Fact-Checking Network takes seriously it's role as a neutral party and can not use partisan activists/advocates as fact-checkers.  This is just common sense.  Since a reasonable prima-facie case has been made by Republicans that the fact-checking was done largely by abortion activists, it is quite fair to suspend judgement on the original video until the investigation completes.

[],bobbyfiend,,,[],,,,text,t2_36gej,False,,"OK, this is potentially really cool, and the authors might be studying something never studied scientifically before, but there are some things to be concerned about, from the [stud](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0346-1)y this blog post-type article is based on:

*TL;DR: the study has red flags associated with ""impressive theory but unconvincing data"" situations*

1. It is really effing difficult to find out how many participants were in this study. Their write-up doesn't follow standard research report format, so (to me, used to reading such reports) it feels almost like they're hiding some key elements of their methods. They probably aren't hiding them, but they sure as hell aren't making them easy to figure out. They appear to maybe have 12 participants in their study. TWELVE.
2. They published this in a journal that is apparently OK with leaving out or obfuscating a few of the methodological details, and isn't a core journal for neuroscience research.
3. The specific method used for imaging isn't the most commonly-used method out there. To me, that suggests they tried a few methods, and when that happens the researchers almost always go with the method that gives them the results they expected. There are TWELVE participants. I would love to see results from a few different imaging methods presented together, for comparison.
4. Neuroimaging is itself under a lot of pressure right now to clean up its act RE: data fishing. The possibilities for p-hacking are built into the entire process, from the ground up: every pixel of an image used (even if it's processed and run through some statistics) is the result of an averaging algorithm, and the choice of which algorithm to use is, from what I understand, non-trivial. Then there's the statistical processes used to aggregate across images (averages of averages), also offering various choices. Finally, there are the statistical procedures used to estimate effect sizes or p-values or whatever, which also offer various choices. That, on top of the fact that there are multiple kinds of imaging techniques in the first place, creates an incredibly high likelihood that neuroimaging studies can represent, essentially, illusions created by the researcher's expectations. One way of reducing the chances of such an outcome is to have MORE THAN TWELVE participants (I keep putting that in caps, and yes I know that many neuroimaging studies are done with small N, but statistics says ""fuck your rationalizations; it's still a tiny N and your confidence interval is so big it can't fit into your mom's muumuu"").
4. I'm not super impressed by their ""nobody has ever studied this before"" line. Maybe they're right, but this is a claim about a personality trait. See the entire field of personality psychology. I don't know if most people have any idea just how many different theories and tests of personality have been created and studied (often with pretty reasonable empirical methods, though not brain scans) over the past 100+ years. I will bet 5 of my own actual dollars that someone else studied this. In fact, I'm going to try to find some time to search, later. Again, the authors' choice of journal seems fishy, and it seems unlikely that reviewers for ""communications biology"" or whatever would have any kind of in-depth knowledge of the personality research literature. **Edit: [of course this claim is bullshit](https://search.proquest.com/openview/47a2561455af6d80b4ff61c7ffb5b2bf/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=29096).**

The claim they make for #4 (above):

&gt;One also has the power to choose not to choose, deliberately to allow one’s actions to be determined automatically by surrounding events. Though other reflexive cognitive processes are the focus of intense attention3,4, such “volition-on-volition”—meta-volition, for short—**has not been previously investigated**. 

(My emphasis). Despite the fancy neuro-cognitive language, they're basically just describing something that would seem familiar to most people, possibly ""spontaneity"" or ""going with the flow"" or similar. It took me literally 10 seconds in google scholar (""personality spontaneity measurement"") to find the report linked above. I'm open to being wrong about this, but I really think these authors are full of shit when they claim they are the first people ever to study or even name this construct.

[],georgioz,,,[],,,,text,t2_ch041,False,,"&gt; The sense of ""self"" comes from conscious representation of associative neural architecture. As one goes through life, you development a ""narrative"" that expresses the continuity of your existence in terms of the goals your culture sets for you and the goals the brain happens to develop that are allowable within cultural and other constraints (e.g. cognitive capacities limit goals - few people can become theoretical physicists - it's simply impossible for most).

I actually think this goes even deeper. There are neuroscientists such as Malcolm MacIver who link consciousness and sense of self with capacity of living organizms to plan. Malcolm has a very interesting theory here. He argues that organisms with simple sensoric apparatus with limited reach that do not have need to plan are purely reaction based. Something happens - e.g. food or predator comes to their vicinity - and they just need to react. Water organizms are often like that due to natural way by which water obscures senses.

However when it comes to land animals and especially animals with advanced sensory such as eyes the situation changes - especially in landscape where predator and prey can use land features to play hide and seek. Suddenly predator needs to plan. It needs to visualize itself comming on its pray from certain angle using land features or plants to hide or even taking into account wind and other things to be useful.

In short these animals need to hypothesize and simulate possible futures in their brain and evaluate which one is more likely to succeed. In this the ""self"" is just the entity that is common to all these hypotheticals. If I do this I will end up here and my belly will be full if I do something else I will end up there and I will not succeed. The sense of self is how decision algorithm looks from the inside sort to speak of. The longer the planning period the more important sense of self becomes.

The internet has commoditised almost everything it is used for, creating a post-scarcity economy. The only thing that is still scarce is our attention.

Many people, confronted with a deluge of content, as the article says, defer the impossible task of choosing the best content to gatekeepers such as Google Search or the recommended items on Amazon. They will consume whatever shows up in front of them and are not really interested in digging deeper, they just want to be entertained (or buy a pair of headphones). At best, the algorithm is unbiased and shows them the most popular items, which creates an endless loop where competitors are shut out. At worst, the algorithm is skewed in order to make money.

Those gatekeepers themselves are also popular because they are popular. being the ""default"" option. For instance, when you want to search something, you go to Google and not Bing. Even if both services are largely identical (and Google even has two more letters to type), you pick Google, because who cares about Bing? This process happened to all gatekeepers, from social media to Youtube, making the winners virtual monopolies that don't even require the use of anticompetitive practices to stay that way. The market is open for all to make a superior competitor, it's just that no one will care.

From this position, they can in turn decide which content will become a monopoly, based on what makes \_them\_ the most money. Their complement (content) is commoditised while they themselves are a monopoly, which as Econ 101 teaches, is a recipe for massive profit.

This dependence on gatekeepers then leads to a large number of content creators failing, and worse than that: finding themselves \_irrelevant\_ (great recipe for depression, btw). No matter how good you are at what you do, no one cares unless a gatekeeper believes they can make money by promoting you. This is the situation musicians were in 50 years ago, which was supposed to be remedied by the internet, but instead expanded to \_all\_ forms of content: news, apps, websites, small stores selling on Amazon, even movies and video games are going that route.

For me it's the experience of reflection upon something that is rewarding in some way. It's advantageous from an evolutionary perspective to experience and therefore reinforce a behaviour.

Not necessarily. But the human experience is vastly more complex than that, combining similar algorithms in the brain with survival instincts, chemical reactions, and of course multiple senses. If you give the machine all of those things, you may very well get something pretty indistinguishable from consciousness.

&gt;How simple a system can be conscious, if the condition is that it selects things which further some goal it ‘has in mind’?

I think this question is slightly the wrong way around. I prefer to think in terms of ""how conscious is a system..."" - the answer, as above, would be: it depends what else is going on.

&gt;is a machine set up to build circuit boards always working towards a goal, and if it actively tries to find better ways of building on the fly, is that then conscious?

If truth is ""relative"", so the argument goes, then any truth is as good as any other, we no longer have any standard by which to criticize claims, and therefore all rational discourse comes to a screaching halt. 

But none of the postmodernist authors who are frequently cited as examples of this relativism ever actually said that - not even Rorty. 

What the postmodernists did call attention to was how narratives are ultimately political tools which serve political purposes, and that these narratives often function with complete disregard to ""facts""; not in the sense that they are necessarily predicated on falsehoods, but rather that the facts themselves can be molded and reframed so as to support whatever narrative we choose. 

Rorty's rejection of ""objective truth"" in favor of pragmatism ultimately amounts to the claim that epistemology is behavioral rather than foundationalist; ""truths"" are designated as such because of the functional role that such beliefs play in the lives of living, breathing human beings.

In other words, some evolutionary innovations are super great and may last forever, others are terrible and fail immediately, and others are good but slightly flawed, so they'll endure for millions of years and then disappear.

One of evolution's latest ""experiments"" would be the ""capacity for caring"", i.e. a complex brain structure that allows living things to compute the best things to care about based on environmental and social cues. This is good, because living things that have this ""algorithm"" can adapt way faster than those that don't: during a lifetime, not over multiple generations. However, it is important to remember that evolution is experiment-driven and *does not look ahead*. Thus if this caring mechanic works great for animals in general, and for humans up to now, but now we've deviated so much from ancient environment and societies that we're starting to keep pets for no reason, saving our evolutionarily unfit brethren and allowing them to reproduce, and so on, well, it *is* possible that this ""capacity to care"" mechanism is actually at its failing point. Seriously. It wasn't *before*, which is why it's still thriving, but it is possible that we've stretched it to the point it is acting erratically and is backfiring.

If it is, then we may expect to eventually be driven out by species that have a better ""capacity to care"" (I'm not limiting this to biological beings or Earth-bound beings -- it could be AI or aliens). Such species would steer clear from our maladaptive behaviors in a technologically advanced setting. Such species have yet to appear, though, and we do have a head start, so we could still endure.

Could rationality here be contrasted with a pseudo-rationality that can be compared to ""randomness"" and ""pseudo-randomness"" in computer science?

As I understand it, there's this thing called ""[random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness)"" embedded in our reality and it's based on unpredictability. 

A rough summary by me but also a link [HERE](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pseudo-random.htm):

A computer cannot be unpredictable by design. If we ask the computer to do something random, the computer is not likely to do something random. So the best way to make a computer generate ""random"" is to have the computer reference various unrelated sources and inter-relate them via algorithms that produce something that we call ""[pseudorandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness).""

For all intents and purposes, the ""pseudorandom"" output is random unless you're familiar with the algorithm the computer uses and what the computer's resources are.

If you know what the computer's resources are and how it uses those resources for its algorithm, then you can find a predictable pattern within the ""pseudorandom"" output.

*Contrasting that random/pseudorandom relationship with human rationality:*

Humans' relationship with random is different than a computer's relationship with random because we start off our own epistemology by depending on ""instincts."" We can deconstruct these instincts if we use the instincts as resources for ""critical thinking"" algorithms to turn our ""instincts"" into ""carefully developed and rationally mature thoughts."" 

The problem is, as with the pseudorandom produced by the computer, our own ""carefully developed and rationally mature thoughts"" are only made up by our instincts. Therefore, we can only be rational if our instincts our rational. 

Here's where the rational/pseudorational split happens. We can refine our instincts more and more the same way we can refine a computer to generate more pseudorandom outputs. ""More and more"" and ""more pseudorandom outputs"" should be thought of as qualitative measures. 

But how do you measure this quality? 

Is my thought more rational than yours? Is this computer's pseudorandom output more pseudorandom than that computer over there?

From the article:

&gt;Logics depend on signs that turn out to be living processes, not inert functions. The world is an event, not a plan.

This makes me think that in my example, ""non-reason"" would be the instincts I'm talking about. 

Instincts are just how we're conditioned to react to to the reality we find ourselves in. We don't understand consciousness only insofar as we can use our instincts to further propel the beliefs that makes us go and these beliefs intertwine with our reality to encourage the instincts that propel the beliefs.

From the article:

&gt;I define rationalism as a way to structure the world according to a pre-set logic and series of identities. Thus defined, it leads to forms of rational control, such as the organisation of a workforce into distinctive tasks according to a plan and grid of measurements. The logic regulates the relations between the identified workers, tasks, performance indicators and times

&gt;So, more seriously, the structure and the logic are also illusions of sufficiency.
 
I belief this last bit I quoted can be related to that quote ""When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.""

The algorithms that make up our ideology are evident by our instincts. Since our instincts expose the underlying mechanisms by which we function. 

Thus we see something and we think it's a nail. It's because our ideology is working as if it were a hammer. Or if I see a bathroom and I have an urging to knock down the walls, that might be just because I'm a contractor. Now switch the topics to ethics or spiritual beliefs or whatever and it becomes the same thing; namely, a matter of reconsidering your initial responses by using your own instinctual output as an input for critical analysis. 

Our instincts are irrational by their nature. What makes them rational is our want to rationalize them. 

From the article:

&gt;In his philosophy of time, Deleuze distinguishes between two types of present: the present as creature of reason and the living present. As creature of reason, the present falls apart and passes events by, because it is caught between overconfidence in a structure in the present and a connected desire to escape the past and control the future. Each rational plan has a terrible relation to time as something that passes and unfolds. The rational present is bound to be undone. And a good thing too, for otherwise it will try to impose itself on future times like a deceiving ruler.

I doubt I'm reading this right, but it would seem that our instincts are irrational by their nature because our instincts developed using a ""universal algorithm"" and we can only interpret our instincts via the ""personal algorithms.""

The only sane thing to do in this circumstance is to take the action that requires the least information: stay in your lane, and break as quickly as can be safely done. Anything else involves too much uncertainty. This isn't a choice between hitting a pedestrian or swerving and hitting a wall. It's a choice between hitting what *may* be a pedestrian in front of you (you aren't sure; if it's just appeared there out of nowhere, your sensors or algorithm could be faulty and it could be a false positive) or swerving into the car beside you (again, if your sensors or algorithm are faulty, then you could also be mistaken about the lane beside you being open), swerve wildly out of control (if there's been a mechanical failure, then your ability to control the car is compromised), hit a curb, bounce off (your AI has neither the information nor programming necessary to perform the complex physics calculations to predict where your car is going to wind up once a collision happens) and land straight on top of the pedestrian who actually only took a step into the road before stepping back.",1561465776,{},es04xa5,False,t3_c4pshb,False,True,t3_c4pshb,/r/philosophy/comments/c4pshb/why_we_need_more_than_just_data_to_create_ethical/es04xa5/,1561465777.0,1,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0.0,,,1561552174.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ideally, they won't happen in the first place. If we have AI smart enough to make decisions and predict things, means we can also create a network that links all driverless cars together (preferably, that will be 100% of all cars in the western world), and also link it to traffic infrastructure.

Once that is done, most, if not all human error is gone from traffic. And human error is the main cause behind any accident.

&amp;#x200B;

So the ""ethical issues"", IF they will occur, will only occur sporadically. Way less than they do now. And the less it happens, the more crazy you can be with solutions to have 0 victims, because traffic can be adapted on a macro scale, not just per individual car, to deal with a threat. 

So it means that a car can make a really ridiculous swerve into the opposite lane (which would be incredibly unsafe in today's world), and the AI would also adjust the trajectory of cars on that other lane to prevent a terrible frontal accident. It would automatically put all traffic lights to red in the vicinity to prevent more cars from entering the area, and then slowly put all cars back on their own lane and continue the journey.   
With that kind of technology, accidents are 99.9% avoidable.   


The only thing will be coding and programming. It also needs to be very safe from hacking. It needs communication between cars and infrastructure.

As I’m reading your post, I’ve also thought the following: is transactive memory like mapping in information theory? If so, transactive memory may an incomplete system, but that’s based on an intuitive application of the Incompleteness Theorem. That is to say it is a single system operating within an ecology of systems. Over-optimization by one species for itself, leading to over-reliance but less feedback in an ecology (cough human species ahem) threatens the stability of the ecological whole. Therefore excessive reliance on transactive memory may affect interwoven bio-physical/social/cognitive systems in marginal but aggregately measurable ways.

He gives vanishing little advice to society because he is not a sociologist (and he appears to despise sociology as a 'scientific' endeavor for that matter) or a politician; he's a psychologist who is trying to get the attention of mentally ailing people and give them advice for how to fix their lives as individuals.  The problem with people judging Peterson's goals and motivations is that they are judging him as a social critic because he has huge audiences while forgetting that actually he's a clinical psychologist trying to help individuals fix their individual problems in their individual lives.  Of course his audience tends to be of a certain, obviously flawed, type.  You're literally judging a psychologist for helping people who need mental help.  He's identified a particularly pathological segment of society--angry young white men--and is talking to them in a way that gets their attention and helps them deal with their anger in the most positive possible way.  

The only proper criticism of him has come from another psychologist who is the only one I'm aware of who actually understands Peterson's project instead of strawmanning it or completely missing the point.  And that criticism is that Peterson is enabling the pathology he is trying to fight against by being a little too sympathetic to its causes in order to attract his audience while not being explicit and strong enough in the problems with the pathology so as not to turn away the audience that needs to hear his message before they've heard it.  This is the only case where Peterson's response was simply 'I understand the criticism and I am aware of its merit but I respectfully disagree and will continue doing my best while taking this criticism under advisement'.

The debates he has had have largely been disappointing because of how fundamentally people are misunderstanding Peterson's true project, and Peterson is in the difficult position of not being able to directly and obviously correct this misunderstanding because to do so would sabotage his mission.  He can't exactly come out and say 'yes I am railing against radical leftists because I want to get the right wing kids in danger of becoming genuine neo-Nazis or skinheads to listen to me and turn their lives around before they go all the way down the rabbit hole and do something really stupid' because to do that would be turn away all the people who need to hear his message most.

At the end of the day, the question is, do people who hear Peterson's message become more or less likely to turn to right wing extremism as a result.  I have no idea what the data is on that, but that's the relevant question.  Peterson states and seems to genuinely believe that he is stopping right-leaning young people from going all the way down the racist/fascist rabbit hole and causing them to get their own lives together in a positive and constructive way.  On the other hand, critics of Peterson seem convinced of the opposite and lump him in with obvious right wing trolls like Milo Yiannopolis or actual racist/fascist agitators like he constantly appears alongside on youtube recommended lists.  I don't know if Peterson himself has reliable data on his 'success' rate, but I do take him at his word at what success would look like to him and I think that's a worthwhile project.  I have absolutely no reason to believe that Peterson's critics have any data whatsoever and instead are some combination of completely misunderstanding him, purposefully misunderstanding him to ride his fame for their own gain, or just ignorantly lumping him in with all the actual fascists that the youtube algorithm automatically lumps him in with because of how Peterson got to be famous in the first place (railing against the Canadian human rights bill that would include transgenderism with other protected classes and thereby lead to a raft of unintended consequences that Peterson details in his videos).",1560215351,{},eqq93r7,False,t3_byxwhc,False,True,t1_eqot5w1,/r/philosophy/comments/byxwhc/carl_jung_and_the_psychology_of_the_manchild/eqq93r7/,1560215352.0,-5,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0.0,,,1560380535.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The article makes an important point that the decisions that are going to be made by self-driving cars are not deterministic ones. There will always be a probability in the evaluations. The author cites approvingly a call for an *ethics of risk-management* rather than updating the trolley problem. 

I would add to this a concept of *global state* versus *local state*. An agent, generally speaking, only has access to a local state of the world, never the exact global state. After the fact we may have that global state, and we may conclude that (1) the self-driving car made the right decision given its local state, and (2) the self-driving car made the wrong decision given the global state. From this we *might* say that the car ought to have had better data in order to infer a local state that is in closer correspondence with the global state. One can of course view this as an engineering problem. But as far as this moral discussion is concerned, it matters because it requires a risk-management ethics to consider that individual agent are ignorant of the facts (to varying degrees), and how ignorant is too ignorant?

There is an additional issue, which is that the algorithms that will guide the self-driving cars are not likely to be explainable. That is, we can never know exhaustively before the fact what the car would do when faced with a crash scenario. So is even an ""ethics setting"" or similar parameters possible? I am doubtful. What is a far more likely practical outcome is that self-driving cars will be subject to tests, just as cars are tested for emissions and crashing into concrete walls with dummies in them. In other words, a new self-driving car plus its algorithm will be subject to artificial tests of dummies walking into roads and so on, with some acceptable range of outcomes specified in the relevant jurisdiction. That way a finite set of representative scenarios are checked. The test cases can of course also include cases where no perfect outcome is possible, but a trade-off is performed. The practical question is then what these tests should be, which in a way takes us back to the more neatly formulated moral dilemmas.

Finally, the article mentions, but does not elaborate on, the question about moral culpability and the risk of a moral gap being created. That is, what if an accident happens, and we conclude something wasn't done right. How to assign culpability? I think prior law may guide this debate, since it isn't entirely new that complex machines can cause damage. Still, self-driving cars are remarkably software heavy, so when we are no longer dealing with finding out who's to blame for, say a mechanical failure due to corrosion of a component caused by a leaking container, and instead are trying to trace a sudden swerve to some ultimate cause. My guess is that this will become practically tested for advanced robotics sooner than for self-driving cars, say a mall robot that causes significant harm.",1558365455,{},eo8fqwe,False,t3_bqvu3p,False,True,t3_bqvu3p,/r/philosophy/comments/bqvu3p/the_ethics_of_crashes_with_selfdriving_cars_a/eo8fqwe/,1558365457.0,2,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0.0,,,1558849086.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ask and receive. This is what comes to mind when I ponder your question:

Preface all this to say that I'm biased (in many ways) to assert that historical documents related to religion and faith provide unique moral guidance and perspective to mankind. Many people disagree; that’s fine. For example, accept for the moment that Christ was a high priest in the order of Melchizedek, and the slaughter of Christ fulfilled the essence of the sacrificial law, thus culminating in the end of korbanot due to the destruction of the 2nd Temple, roughly a generation after the crucifixion and resurrection...

So, given all that, let's cherry-pick some of Paul's NT writings for general insight into why racism is objectively wrong:

Paul wrote, ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."" Elsewhere, Paul wrote ""Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all."" Now is that meant to be read that followers of Christ should seek to alienate people that are not so called Christians? Paul wrote, ""For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.""

Read how the apostles conducted themselves. They aimed to spread the gospel, not by the sword, but thru rhetorical strategy via common-ground toward a compelling argument for faith. Some were sold on the idea, some were not. They did not advocate to politically or physically control those that rejected the gospel.

Beyond ethics, racial prejudice between ethnic group(s) is rooted in knee-jerk tribalism, a common, competitive mode of all human beings. The underlying reasons for prejudice generally stem from one or a combination of the following categories (in no particular order &amp; some overlap likely):

1) Political/Geographical, such as the management or control of territory, resources, wealth, trade, own-group-sentiment.

2) Physical/Biological, including phenotypes and perhaps even the perceived judgment of “evolutionary fitness”.

3) Worldview/Philosophy/Religion

4) Sociological/Cultural, such as socio-economic tiers, societal norms, customs, practices &amp; traditions.

The key issue is the heart of man. Racial prejudice always is driven by fear, envy, and/or pride. With that said, the formation of phenotypes in the first place was likely driven by survival, and common-ground relationships.

Practically-speaking, however, stereotypes are understandable. Humans tend towards oversimplification by connecting-the-dots as a sort of data compression algorithm. So one group’s dreaded stereotype can be, at the same time, an in-group symbol, action, or fact that allows for objective identification within the group. So there are varying degrees of inherent tribalism steeped within the racial and ethnic constructs, edging towards possession. So stereotypes have a basis in probability, however, the binary assumptions are oversimplifications that can be perceived as territorial encroachments. This is the argument on cultural appropriation, however, the “PC red lines” can become about as blurry as quantum mechanics, and the hypersensitivity placed upon the minds of mankind could as easily be solved with a heavy dose of forgiveness and temperance.

Overall, racism is another form of evil action meant to divide and conquer the human race. Metaphysically, there are notions that Good and Evil are at odds with each other in some dualistic war for eternity. Going back to the Christ worldview theme from earlier, the enemy Lucifer is not warring against the Creator directly (because it is futile). Instead, the “accuser” wars against mankind in hopes of turning them from the Creator. The accuser’s goal is to enact first-strike via racial, ethnic, political, financial motivations (via sins of the flesh) so as to orchestrate a cycle of mutually-assured retaliation and destruction for generations. The accuser’s only hope is to wipe out mankind, while using mankind itself as the weapon. All the individual can do is guard their heart against such kinds of manipulation by seeking the wisdom and will of God. Even seeing another ethnic group wield racial hate is not enough excuse to join with cross-accusations. In other words, there is self-defense, but not to the point of retaliating a genocide. The key factor here regards the Sons of Edom in the OT. Isn’t the Creator a genocidal maniac? Or are we being taught something critical about how God views sin &amp; evil? Wouldn’t men purposefully engaging in genocide be a form of secular-humanism or man being their own God? Isn’t that the same old temptation embodied by the pride of Lucifer itself?

Regarding learning, of the ideas that I like to toy with is that maybe there are ""levels"" to the spaces in which you can ""learn"".

Pavlov's dogs are a good example, and something that can very easily be repeated with ML. If you feed in sounds of bells combined with pictures of food into an ML algorithm it is trivial to develop a model which can distinguish between that and another picture/sound combination.

If you were referring to AI all along, and never intended to make or defend the claim that humans could make judgments without relying on intuition, I still think your position is dubious. How do these intuition-less AI you take such a circuitous route to not-really-describing actually go about evaluating the process of conjecture and refutation without intuition playing any role? Saying the process ""might look different across different agents"" doesn't really give any sort of meaningful evidence in favor of the idea that a process lacking what we think of as intuition could exist, would work, or would functionally differ from an algorithm. How does this AI judge whether or not its conjectures have been refuted without relying at all on intuition? Just *saying* that AIs don't need intuition is easy, but it's also meaningless; asserting your position as an *a priori* truth isn't an argument. 

Coming up with any workable form of cognition that truly does not rely on intuition isn't really so easy. In order to make value judgments of any kind, the AI would have to select a system of values, but there are multiple competing value systems and even metaystems. So how does it select one of these systems? It would need to adopt a value system to rate the value of the value systems without simply choosing based on intuition, but it obviously can't do this without having chosen a value system, which it cannot do without having a system it can use to establish the value of each value system, and so on. Trying to frame the choice of value system as a conjecture that can later be refuted doesn't really alleviate this problem, because for any system which is not intrinsically self-contradictory the ""conjecture"" of accepting value system can never really be refuted from within its own system without recourse to intuition (i.e. seeing that a result consist with the system is *intuitively* undesirable). The very concept of refutation is, on a certain level, pinned to intuition if you dig deep enough. The easiest example of this is the question of why we accept logic at all. Obviously, we cannot justify the use of logic through logic, since that would be a circular argument. If not through intuition, how do justify logic at all? If you're going to go back to Popper and argue we should abandon ""justification"" for corroboration, well (without recourse to intuition or any argument dependent on it) why do we do that?",1555843597,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",elex9n6,False,t3_ba9s5g,,True,t1_elef2y3,/r/philosophy/comments/ba9s5g/a_theory_about_what_philosophical_intuitions_are/elex9n6/,1555843599.0,1,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,,,,1555929995.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basic game theory dictates that a ""tit for tat"" strategy where an individual gets a punishment roughly equal to the damage they caused, yet does not keep a grudge after that, tends to yield much better results in a society where there is constant and sustained interaction (basically any society).

A good explanation can be done through the use of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and a tournament of ""iterated prisoner's dilemma"" was held, with a simple ""tit for tat"" sense of justice faring better than much more complex algorithms:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOvAbjfJ0x0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOvAbjfJ0x0)

Basically, from basic game theory, we need a sense of fair punishment in a society to encourage coöperation and discourage bad behaviour. 

The issue is to gauge what constitutes fair punishment. But how to determine damage and cost when we can only threaten through prison and money? What's a fair punishment for swindling, abuse of confidence, rape, or murder? How does the fairness change depending on the economic and social circumstances of the individual? That's where it all gets thorny.

One thing is clear, however. We know from game theory that ""overdoing"" the punishment (similar to the Grudger algorithm) out of a sense of self-righteousness and purity (common in religious societies) yields far worse results than being fair about the punishment and then bringing the individual back to the fold after the punishment.",1555697229,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",elaa96f,False,t3_bezugw,,True,t3_bezugw,/r/philosophy/comments/bezugw/punishment_isnt_about_the_common_good_its_about/elaa96f/,1555697235.0,2,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,,,,1555793604.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These systems are made in a way that they change over time; early star systems were very different from the ones of today, with molecular complexity increasing over time.  

This is a genetic algorithm, which we already use commonly in programming.  Then, of course, any organics that do develop also operate on their own genetic algorithms, breeding or otherwise multiplying, and operating on the concept of survival of the fittest.

There is a maximum speed, the speed of light, remniscent of reaching the max size of some variable type in programming - so they put in a failsafe to make sure nothing can overflow the variable.  Plus, because of time dilation and the speed of light being finite, no civilization can realistically ever reach or even see another one - from any point of view in the universe, you can only see into the past in all directions, so it's like isolating all of the test cases in a way they can never interfere with eachother.

I agree. 

But nobody was suggesting it is necessary for an agent to compute the equilibrium. Even the most traditional neoclassical economist doesn't suggest this. They more often suggest -- as you do -- that every person operates within their local ball but then the resulting distributed algorithm of everyone in the market pursuing their own self-interest in their myoptic view leads the whole market to an equilibrium (or close to it).

The theoretical computer scientist comes in and says: it doesn't matter that this computation is distributed. It is still just a computation and still in the class of polynomial time. Thus, in hard markets (or in the case of evolution on hard landscapes), it won't find the optimum. Or even an approximate optimum (depending on the exact definition of approximate; see [my responses elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/bbyy9i/local_maxima_and_the_fallacy_of_jumping_to/ekpbjuz/?context=3)).

In general, I don't think this is related to discussions of bounded rationality (at least as traditionally understood).

In other words, on the operational level it is optimizing.

This is exactly what theoretical computer science was built for. It can reason about arbitrary algorithms trying to solve some problem or act as if they are solving some problem, without having to know the details of a particular algorithm. 

I think this is what confuses /u/ecolonomist, because maybe they think that the cstheorists are just making the psychology critique (which can be responded to with as if) or they think that cstheorists are making a critique from assuming a particular algorithm.

...where this falls apart is when the person does not unambiguously communicate that they want to stop and argue ""they should have known I felt uncomfortable"". I think at the heart of some of these issues we are vilifying people who are themselves also the victim of someone else's anxiety or manipulation. A sadly common scenario for young people.

Full up, if you unambiguously initiate or agree to sex then decide ""ehh, maybe I shouldn't have done this"" in the middle and 1. Say nothing. 2. Make no change in body language, or 3. 'Fake it'  ... How could the other person ever know? Sure, there is now emotional damage to the receiver. Sure, that's bad. But is the 'giver' really guilty of any wrong? In my opinion, absolutely not. Men and women are often guilty of 'playing the part' in sex instead of being honest that they're not really feeling it. Often they do so as a gift to their partner and intentionally deceive them into sex they don't want. Laws of affirmative consent are extremely difficult to reconcile against the complexities of human social and sexual behaviour.

Sometimes people are hurt and there isn't another person you can blame for it. In fact, sometimes you're hurt and it's your own fault. I think this murky scenario defines all too many college-age sexual assault cases where one part is guilty - or even both parties are equally guilty - of poor communication, anxiousness and 'playing the part' instead of communicating unambiguously.

It's not that physics is not important. But if your view was right - or shared by decision makers - then sociology departments would not exist. But that's not the case. So there needs to be decisions to be made how much research money to allocate to sociologists, philosophers, and physicists. Yeah, that is not related to the ""objecticity"" of physics, but it's related to what we *learn* about.

You don't need to tell me that, but science may have that goal and still have subjective points in it. (Not sure what that^s even supposed to mean). I really recommend you read this article, it's a classic and outlines the potential problems in biology very well 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/4320377?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

For chemistry, I recommend this: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cmdc.201500091 which is a great study into how industry chemists decide which molecules to look into in order to figure out whether they may help in future medication. That's a peculiar problem - because there's no way to know which ones will work out and you need tons of money to look into specific molecules with no guarantee anything comes out of it. What is of interest here is the very subjective argumentation the chemists use to convince their department head that their molecule deserves more funding. 

For physics, I mean I'll gladly grant that it's much less ""subjective"". I don't want to say that we shouldn't be reasonably certain of the outcomes. Not at all. What I'm saying is that your statement that science is completely subjectivity free is wrong.  (And then again,  Quantum Mechanics interpretations are probably not testable , making it a matter of taste rather than empirical testing. To be fair tho, many physisicts don't subscribe to either interpretation)

You then backtracked to 64, good on ya, except you treat that as definitive, then later bring up that there's actually a range of 6 years he could have died in, but you stick to 64 because it suits your case when it could just as well only be 58 years based solely on data you provided. You also treat the year 94 as definitive when data you brought into the debate says it could have been 93, but that doesn't help your case does it. That puts us based solely on data you provided at a range of 57 and 64 years assuming that he wrote the book within the year it was published, a stretch even with modern keyboards.

Depending on account, Jesus died somewhere between AD 30 and AD 36. If you are not aware, 30 (death) + 64 (my claim) = 94 (year of publication).

Meanwhile your claim of 33 you admitted pulling out of your ass just 2 posts above.

They looked at their DNA. They found general patterns of mutations/variations for those people. It's *those* gene clusters that they look at, and where they are today.

They then take those patterns and apply them to everyone else.

So when you get your results, it's ""where do people who share a similar proportion of of random mutations live at the minute"" and they sort of hope that those gene patterns have been there for a while and the deep ancestors of those people weren't moving.

And they don't test your entire genome - they test selected parts.

So there's lots of places it could go wrong.

Only testing selected positions means that it could (by accident) over or under select genes from different branches of your family, giving an inaccurate picture.

There's a chance that you have a rarer gene type for your area of origin, which throws off the algorithm.

For example, there are a small number of men with the same surname in Yorkshire, England, who have a Y chromosome that is strongly of West African history. The current theory is that this is a rare instance of Roman DNA (ie 2000 years old) that has transmitted down the male line.

But if you were American and had a different surname, and you got your West African Y chromosome, you wouldn't be thinking Yorkshire.

And finally, we're all interrelated anyway, and there has always been movement of genes, so the 1% of Scandinavian in a person who thought they were Italian is probably highly irrelevant.

Bitcoin arouse out of the need for a anonymous, and universal currency. i.e.; the value of canadian currency vs us currency wouldn't change.

&amp;#x200B;

But to remain anonymous, but still be able to accurately record information, the transactions between bitcoin users needed to be encrypted with a complex mathematical algorithm. This is essentially a confidential checkbook or bank ledger. It makes sure that person A paid person B, but hides that information.

&amp;#x200B;

Each time a transaction is made using bitcoin, a computer has to use processing power to solve those algorithms and confirm that person A paid person B. Well, over thousands of transactions this can take up quite a bit of processing power to solve these complex algorithms to confirm each parties funds and transactions. The solution to this is to borrow public CPU power, (you and me) in exchange for a opportunity to get bitcoin through solving these algorithms. This is called bitcoin mining. I'm lending you my computers ability and processing power to help solve those algorithms and ensure all transactions are legitimate, in exchange to find bitcoins depending on how successful it is.

&amp;#x200B;

This means bitcoin is a currency whos value is consistent world wide, non taxable, extremely hard, almost impossible to steal, and totally anonymous.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin rapidly gained popularity, but concern and evidence of bitcoin being used to purchase contraband to avoid paying taxes, and launder money into other currencies, thus eliminating the paper trail.

&amp;#x200B;

Some bitcoin users were arrested and convicted of various crimes for participating in bitcoin transactions, where the money ultimately ended up in criminals hands and resulted in bad things happening. This didn't totally kill bitcoin, because the arguement could be made that the bitcoin users should have no liability in asking or knowing what their currencies are used for. This resulted in a rapid drop in bitcoin price,

&amp;#x200B;

It has since been rapidly spiking and dropping in price, but overall, gradually decreasing, and in my opinion, you should expect it to. It's too risky to invest in. It could be declared illegal by a government at any point because of the tax evasions and your assets would be frozen. Or god forbid you end up being charged criminally for reasons like the aforementioned, and lastly, as the use of cryptocurrency becomes more apparent in horrendous crimes like sex traffiking, i'd expect public outcry to rise over time if it somehow did take traction again over a moderate period of time.

[],1tacoshort,,,[],,,,text,t2_ubz966e,False,[],"If you're a coder, here are some tips to the interview.  

Study up.  Know your hashes, binary trees (trees seem especially important -- binary trees are the most important, here, but it probably wouldn't hurt if you're familiar your balanced trees, red/black trees, and similar), and linked lists.  Know your big-O notation and be able to talk to it for any algorithm that you discuss.

Be ready to code on the board.  All of the interview questions are coding questions.  Get some practice -- have your friends throw questions at you and code-up your solutions in real-time, explaining why you're doing what you're doing.  Then give the O notation for the algorithm you've just coded up.  Also, expect to be asked if your solution scales up to the data-sets-of-enormous-size that Google tends to deal with.

Be enthusiastic.  Be excited about solving the problems that they're giving you.  I think one of my best answers was for a throw-away problem the interviewer gave me.  I gave him the classical answer to his question (which, it turns out, was all he really wanted) but told him that I figured they expected better than this because this is Google.  I came up with a more optimal solution and then refined it further.  His throw-away question became the entire interview but I think he liked how excited I got about the process.

Relax.  It's OK to be wrong once (_maybe_ twice).  If you clearly don't know the answer to a question, the interviewers are instructed to move on and not dwell on the problem.  Also, some of the interview questions might not have an optimal answer (it helps if you recognize an NP-complete problem if they give it to you) but, in those cases, they are looking for a good-enough solution.

Know that the Google interview is capricious.  Many truly brilliant programmers don't get hired because they got unfair questions or too-strict interviewers.  If you don't make it this time, it doesn't say anything bad about you -- you can always try, again, later.  If you _do_ make it, congratulations!

You're right. Their wording also seems to imply that NIST is company that created their own algorithm.

Your next example is invalid. People like to break things down into ""bottom line"" metrics, but that simply doesn't exist for realm. The two measurements that are often used for evaluating facial recognition algorithms are FMR (false match rate) and FNMR (false none-match rate). While these can give you a number to compare different algorithms against each other, but they don't translate into real world results.

The datasets that NIST uses are Mugshot images, Webcam images, VISA, VISA 2, WILD, and Exploited Children (yes, it's a thing and they use it in their tests). The Mugshot and VISA datasets are just direct front shots of people's faces and the WILD dataset is a number of images (in the millions) of a select number of people at various angles, lighting conditions, etc. None of the tests that NIST does involves video, which is significant. With video you have potentially dozens, if not hundreds, of chances to correctly match an individual (30fps over a number of seconds). This drastically ups the accuracy since you only need one correct match out of the hundreds, and people move their heads around frequently so the chances are higher that the camera will get a clear view.

[],metacollin,,,[],,,,text,t2_3fhs2,False,,"It’s not that simple.  It is completely nonsensical to compare AlphaZero to a single human brain, and AlphaZero is not “far more intelligent than humans”. 

It is much better at finding solutions in an explicitly defined, extremely simple and narrow problem space, and an algorithm optimized the weights of a large number of what are ultimately just mathematical functions (the neural net).  An algorithm we wrote, on hardware we built, to play a game we invented.  

A basic pocket calculator is much better at math than any human.  According to you, this makes every calculator “far more intelligent than humans”.  A book is much better at remembering information than a human.  By your definition, all books are much smarter than humans.  

Of course, books aren’t more intelligent, nor are calculators, nor is AlphaZero, and the reason you say otherwise is not because it is so, but because your definition of intelligence is stupid and not useful.

It would be totally accurate to say that AlphaZero is far better at chess than any human.  That it is.  One could even say it is far better at learning to play chess well than any human.  But that is all.  To say that it’s far more intelligent than a human requires that you define intelligence as, and ***only*** as “skill at playing and learning to play chess”.  

And that’s a fucking stupid way to define intelligence, nor is such a definition useful.  Why don’t you just fucking stop it? Please?

Beyond that though, it’s still a ridiculous comparison.  The human brain consumes about 20W of power.  Only a fraction of that can possibly be devoted to playing chess for a human, as significant amounts of the brain (and thus the 20W it consumes) are devoted to sensory processing of vision, sound, and all the other senses, to motor control, to operating the human meat suit that is the body.  Indeed, the power consumption of the brain does not measurably vary depending on mental task.  It does not even go down when we sleep.  

In reality, the bulk of the brain’s power consumption is consumed doing no computation at all, but rather maintaining various charge gradients over trillions of neurons, allowing them to be able to fire if needed.  The firing itself, however, uses almost no power in comparison.  

Thinking does consume a minute amount of additional glucose, but it is so small as to be, in terms of power, undetectable.  We have to use fMRIs to look at blood flow instead.  

So, lets be exceedingly generous and say the brain consumes a whopping 100mW additional power to play chess.  Understand that this figure is completely absurd and the true number, while not known, does have upper limits, and it is far far less than 100mW.  Simply because we could detect the additional calories consumed for certain tasks if it were on that scale.  But we can’t, so it is much much less. 

But like I said, I’m being exceedingly generous.  

Each of the tensor units that run AlphaZero consume 200W of power, and there were 5000 of them used for the training/learning.  

200W*5000 TPUs = 1,000,000 Watts.  So using the 100mW figure for a human playing chess, that means the only fair or reasonable comparison is one somehow made to 10 million human brains, not one.  

So even if we pretend like your definition of intelligence isn’t completely fucking stupid (which it definitely is), the comparison itself is almost as stupid.  Here is a similar comparison:  10,000,000 humans are stronger than one human.  Or smarter.  Or whatever.  

Like, no fucking shit Sherlock, what an insightful comparison.  

The playing itself only involved 5 tensor units and a 44 core cpu (likely itself 205W).  But that doesn’t matter, since you’re claiming AlphaZero is somehow “the same” or some nonsense.  So, by your own statements, it would not make sense to assume anything but an identical reduction in necessary power for the human brain when playing vs. learning to play chess.  So that 100mW figure is proportionally less, and you’re still stuck with that 10,000,000 human brains comparison.

I've heard of those bulk conversion programs before but even that, to me, seems like a stopgap measure. Surely most conversions aren't lossless so there's only so many times you can do that. I mean, yea, it works probably rather well for 200 years or so but what if we're talking 1000 years or more?

&gt;Uncompressed formats, like TIFF and WAV, have a special advantage in that they're practically self-documenting. You don't need a special algorithm to make sense of them; if a future archivist is capable of reading the file at all, and they can figure out that each bit, or byte, or three or six bytes, is a single pixel, then they can figure out the rest fairly quickly by trial and error.

I never knew those uncompressed formats were ""easier to figure out"". But they still aren't analog, are they? So you still need some idea of the machine they were supposed to run on. Again, over a few decades or maybe centuries, that's not a problem. But what if future generations don't use binary electronics anymore? I have no idea how file formats like those work but could someone not used to electronic computers figure out what to do with a WAV file?",1568847017,{},f0ptgy7,False,t3_d5it1k,False,True,t1_f0nn32o,/r/todayilearned/comments/d5it1k/til_that_over_the_last_300_years_strange_bronze/f0ptgy7/,1568847018.0,1,True,[],False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],PhasmaFelis,,,[],,,,text,t2_3rh9c,False,,"I actually know this! I worked in [digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) for a university library for several years. Yes, a top-quality digital archive system will store both the original file and a version converted to a more future-proof format (if necessary). Beyond that, it will also have utilities to bulk-convert all files of a certain type to a new format if a previous format is losing relevance, and will continue to store all previous formats as well.

A lot of consideration goes into selecting sustainable file formats as well. Per Wikipedia, good file formats are ""open, standard, non-proprietary, and well-established;"" important factors include ""disclosure, adoption, transparency, self-documentation, external dependencies, impact of patents, and technical protection mechanisms."" Uncompressed formats, like TIFF and WAV, have a special advantage in that they're practically self-documenting. You don't need a special algorithm to make sense of them; if a future archivist is capable of reading the file at all, and they can figure out that each bit, or byte, or three or six bytes, is a single pixel, then they can figure out the rest fairly quickly by trial and error.

But of course uncompressed formats take up huge amounts of space, so they're not always practical. Therefore, documentation is also critical to digital preservation. Ideally, the algorithms used to view files should be stored with the files themselves, in plaintext. There's also research into backup techniques and long-term stable storage media.

The ultimate goal of digital preservation is that data should still be readable after the deaths of both the people and the institution that archived it.

[],ZanyDelaney,,,[],,,,text,t2_1095eu,False,,"The Y2K computing problem was not really a 'bug'. Designers of old systems in say the 1960s *intentionally* used the *YY*MMDD date format not *CC*YYMMDD to save space as memory was expensive, and the systems were not expected to still be in use by 2000.

And, it *did* come. 

I used to be a programmer at a large insurance company in Australia. We ran a big old American batch system (some old copybooks had '88 levels' that referred to US states).

A simple case: a motor vehicle insurance policy calculates driver age each renewal, and goes off to a table and gets the premium. In 1999, for a driver born in 1958 the program would go 99 - 58, get 41, and go get the premium for a driver aged 41. But for 2000, the program would go 
00 - 58, and come up with -58. Or maybe it would just register the result as 58, depending on how things were set up - who knows? Either way that is a problem as that is not the driver's age. Later processes would do unpredictable things. What happens if you look-up the premium table using an age of -58? No one knows - the system has never done that before. How many different processes go off and do something with that -58 / 58? No one is really sure.

Now, our system had 100s of datasets. Permanent record datasets, tables, plus, different processes created many different temporary datasets passed program to program and used in 1000s of calculations. I mean our system created hundreds of daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and even four-yearly reports. Each report was created by reading through hundreds of thousands of records and doing all sorts of calculations involving many different dates. We weren't just creating those reports for our own amusement. They were used and many had legal repercussions.

Even simple policy records had many many more dates than what was obvious to a casual observer: it was not just policy start date and policy expire date. Each record and many many dates and half of them I never even knew exactly what they were for. Each policy has accounting records associated with them, all with multiple dates in the record. Each date would potentially be used for something, somewhere. Dates would be compared and have calculations and sorting done on them.

Once the year 2000 dates showed up as *00*0101 for example, there were hundreds of processes that would start doing unexpected things. All the tables which had lookup information about premium rates, commission rates, etc., all had multiple dates on every single record. If the premium goes up effective 31 December 1998 the table must have a date on every record so that policies effective 30 December 1998 look up the old rate and policies effective 31 December 1998 get the new rate.

Here in Australia every little internal operation at work was audited, including computer systems. If the auditors found that our system was coming up with unexpected dates somewhere, we'd be in deep trouble. If unfixed, they could shut the company down.

Anyway Y2K did definitely happen. Some of our obscure accounting algorithms started doing weird things starting 1996.

So we went through and fixed all the dates in a huge overhaul. We did not get paid any different to before, it was just done as part of our normal job. The changes had to be in production well before 1 January 2000, because the system would start generating policy renewal terms for the period 1 January 2000 to 1 January 2001, in November 1998.

Mostly we expanded dates by adding centuries everywhere. In rare cases of program really expected to have a short life we put in a pivot date algorithm.",1568228977,{},ezx00c5,False,t3_d2trrz,False,True,t3_d2trrz,/r/todayilearned/comments/d2trrz/til_how_the_modernisation_of_it_infrastructures/ezx00c5/,1568228991.0,1,True,[],False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s why you got that push notification 1 hour or even 1 day after a post was made. You will make more frequent stops to the platform if the platform withholds updates from close friends and dispersed them over time. 

Eventually the machine learning algorithm gets a very effective hold on your dopamine, and you unconsciously start opening Facebook or Twitter feeling as if by your own will.

You are actually trying to pick a fight with me...over a comment about talking about definitions of words...on a forum. I'm not sure how to respond to that.

Is it possible you are just being a *tad* bit melodramatic and taking things far too seriously? 

This is an internet forum, true, but it's people talking that decides the definitions of all sorts of things. And when people disagree on things, hey cool a conversation can start. That's what forums can allow. It's a cool thing about talking to people about ideas and concepts. And when I think somebody is doing a disservice to societal understanding of things, there's no reason not to speak up.

Unfortunately, I think the only person currently being a jerk a bit here is you. ""Picking a fight"" over the internet because they wanted to talk about a concept? Come on now, you don't want to be that person. If you don't want to talk about things, then don't. No need to turn it into a hostile environment where you begin rudely insulting each other.

Web sites that got linked to a lot by sites that had high PageRank scores were given higher PageRank scores, and vice versa. Like, if everybody was linking to Wikipedia pages, Google figured that Wikipedia was probably a big deal. They could figure this out just by looking at what links to what.

Imagine that each distinct word or short phrase in a news article got its own ""web page"", and it links to every word that appears close to it. If you ran PageRank on this imaginary collection of web pages, it would notice some words and phrases that seemed to be really central and important. If there's a news article talking about a dog who ate Brexit, or whatever, then ""dog"" and ""ate"" and ""Brexit"" would stand out as really key parts of the article. 

Once you've figured out which bits of the article matter the most, you can try picking out the top 10 most important sentences and, boom, suddenly you've got a ten-sentence excerpt. It works better than you'd expect!

A stronger kind of randomness is ""passes certain statistical tests"" which is a very strong condition in practice. Currently a good psudeorandom number generator needs to pass a whole host of tests in order to be p0considered useable. This is the kind of randomness most often used in science and engineering. 

Stronger than this is ""cryptographically secure"" randomness. This requires that the PRNG not only pass statistical tests but be able to resist deliberate attack.

The bombes were just massive, parallel computer systems that could do exactly what people could do, but faster, more accurately, and correlate the results better. Let's say that youve got a simple substitution code, like Rot13. That means that each letter of your message is substituted with the letter 13 letters down the alphabet, with a wraparound at the end. You, a Nazi, fill out your message, scramble it, and text it out over the radio one letter at a time. Archibald, an Englishman, records your message. If he can figure out how you've got it scrambled, he can read your message. So he tries lots of different techniques, like counting how often certain letters appear, or looking for words that he might reasonably expect to see. Then he figures out the algorithm to run the rest of the message through, and sees if it's readable. Enigma was kind of like a rotation scheme that changed based on a particular word, and then changed based on where in the word the letter was, and then changed every few letters, and so on and so forth, making it really complicated. So much so that one person couldn't conceivably do all the possible calculations to unscramble even one message in their lifetime, and even if you had a thousand people all working on it, it couldn't be done in a reasonable amount of time. Alan Turing's contribution was to not only automate the process, but eliminate the calculations that were mathematically impossible or unlikely, like all the letters being set to A.

That number is put through a number of mathematical operations to produce a second number.

1. unless you know the seed number, you can't predict what the next number in the sequence will be.
2. You can't take a number produced by these operations and work backwards. That is, you can't take a number and work out the numbers that came before it.
3. The numbers produced are uniform (each number appears roughly the same number of times as any other number).

I put random in quotes because these numbers aren't truly random: they're purely deterministic.

For modern NNs trained with mini-batch gradient descent, there are basically two sources of ""randomness"". One is in the initialization of the algorithm (mainly the initial values of the connection weights). The other is the selection of batches that are used to compute gradients. The learning algorithm doesn't pick ""new things to try"" randomly - that would take forever to make progress. Rather, it updates parameters based on gradient information that says what direction is likely to lead to an improvement. The only (pseudo-)randomness is in the data that is used to compute gradients, which is often a (pseudo-)randomly selected subset of the training data that is resampled at each training epoch.

Moreover, the numbers used to seed these computations aren't truly random. What you say about the use of true randomness is not accurate. First of all, it is (still) rare for computers to have a source of true randomness built in. And while it is possible to use sources of true randomness if you want to, this is rarely necessary outside of pretty niche scientific applications (this is why computers don't tend to have them, even though the technology exists). For training NNs, and many other purposes, it is actually undesirable to have true randomness, because a truly random process is impossible to reproduce exactly, unless you store the entire stream of random numbers in memory. Pseudorandom number streams, on the other hand, can be reproduced precisely just by knowing the method that was used to generate the numbers, and the number (known as the ""random seed"") that was used to initialize the stream.

Alternatively, you could use reversible encryption to store passwords. Then there's no throwing data away, and therefore no collisions. But it also means an attacker only has to crack one of the passwords, and they have the key for all of the passwords. To prevent this, you'd have to a) use a different key for each password, which then has to be stored, which means it can be hacked and discloses all the passwords, or b) use salted encryption, but that still has to be stored and can be hacked, and again it comes down to finding the master key for one password and the attacker can decrypt all of them.

In short, even if reversible encryption was faster than hashing (and it basically never is), you wouldn't use it in the use cases where hashing is currently recommended. There's no such thing as a lossless hash, and using reversible encryption and throwing away the key doesn't help here in any way.

What’s often missed is that common core doesn’t require a specific way of teaching math, only that children are taught MULTIPLE WAYS to solve a problem. This is why they can’t “borrow and carry” for every problem, because as it gets more complex, it’s not a one size fits all application. Students who learn just one way are not good flexible problem solvers. If the problem doesn’t fit the algorithm they know, they give up. We’re now equipping them with the tools to fail and then try again in a new way. 

This requirement prompted teachers to delve more into research and what was found overall was that students just learned math facts, not necessarily math concepts. Years ago, students learned math through simple algorithms and rote memorization. Higher level math, such as calculus and trig backs failure points since students couldn’t manipulate the equations in the ways needed to comprehend more complex equations. 

Research was done of professional mathematicians and it was found that they didn’t use these same algorithms. No “carry the two” or “cross multiplying,” at least not blindly. Rather, they had an understanding of how numbers relate and interact. They had strong “number sense”. 

Both common core and this push towards more number sense happened so close to the same time, and complemented each other so well, that many adults who didn’t place the same level of importance on number sense met common core with backlash.

Video games are very different. Most of your performance is consumed by branching conditions (if... then... else...), which doesn't happen in video streaming.

For example, anything multiplied by one is itself, but how would you know that's a multiplication you're doing?

The most basic strategy for a chess playing algorithm is to evaluate the next few moves and choose the most promising one. But let's look at a program that wants to calculate the best first move.

At the very start of a chess game, you have 20 possible movements. You need to pick one of them, and then your opponent must choose from their own 20 possible movements. This means that, by the time your next turn comes, you can be in one out of 400 different board configurations (20 * 20 = 400). Some of them are more ""useful"" than others.

For simplicity, let's assume that you still have 20 possibilities for your second move. That means that there are 400 * 20 = 8,000 valid board configurations to consider. And once your opponent chooses one of his 20, you are up to 160,000.

As you can see, evaluating all possible movements on a board gets very expensive very quick - by the time our third turn comes, we need to consider well over a million possibilities if we want to pick the very best. ""Pruning"" is the name of a technique used to simplify this problem. Based on the idea that not all moves are equally important, you add a strategy that allows you to ignore some board configurations because they are not likely to be good.

Choosing the right ""prunning"" strategy is a problem by itself: if you don't remove enough choices, then your chess playing algorithm will be slow because there are too many choices to consider; but if you remove too many choices, you may overlook the best one.",1568728511,{},f0lsm5p,False,t3_d53zra,False,True,t1_f0ktjgw,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/d53zra/eli5_when_youre_playing_chess_with_the_computer/f0lsm5p/,1568728513.0,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For boardgames like chess, that could be a function that rates every piece on the board by what it can do and its position.

If by conjecture you mean he speculated and had opinions about specific things, sure, that's what scientists are supposed to do. Recursion is supposed to be fundamental to UG. There's a lot of debate about what's common and what isn't but there's no alternative framework to UG and Skinnerian behaviorism in the form that you can teach chimps sign language and other nonsense is just kind of a joke.

&gt; Overall he didn't seem to be well-respected outside USA and i wonder what exactly is the actual theory that is universally true. Is it just this?

There's broad and specific formulations of UG. My understanding is that there's little consensus on specific ones. But, broadly, UG is saying that language is a biological and cognitive apparatus, and that's very difficult to dispute. There's scientists that focus on different things but I doubt you'll find many who think language is just something you learn, like a soup recipe or something.

&gt;Is it powered by particular part in brain, or genetically? How does a particular cat not talking to a particular dog prove anything? 

I don't know how much research there's been on this in any anatomical sense, but the idea is that people have a genetically hard-wired ""algorithm"" that makes language acquisition possible. 

&gt;How does a particular cat not talking to a particular dog prove anything? Would that mean that both cats and dogs are missing a component humans have, or that cats and dogs aren't even able to vocally produce the same sounds? 

It would mean that cats and dogs don't have any cognitive capacity to parse or produce language, independent of externalization. For example, a dog can associate words with actions (e.g. ""walk"") but can't tell you the difference between ""throw the stick in the river"" and ""throw the river in the stick.""

&gt;Does language is based on innate cognitive faculties even have any informational value (as a theory or result of a research), or is it a statement that is vague enough so that it can't be neither proven or disproven since it relies on exact definition of each of the words?

We have integers, rational numbers, algebraic numbers, computable numbers and approachable numbers, each being completely contained by the next: all integers are rational, all rational numbers are algebraic and so forth.

Integers are simple. Rational numbers can be defined rations of integers:  x = 4/7 and so forth. 

Algebraic numbers can be defined as roots to finite length polynomials with integer (or rational) coefficients:  x^2 =2, and so forth. Non-algebraic numbers are called transcendental numbers.

Computable numbers are numbers with recursive definitions, infinite sums or products and so forth. Pi is one of these. These numbers can be computed to any defined precision in a finite time by a definable algorithm. 

Note here the ""any defined precision"": even though we can approximate all numbers to some precision, as per my first response, we can't reliably express them to an arbitrary precision.

Approachable numbers are numbers, that are the limits of of computable numbers: by e.g. having a parameter in the algorithm approach infinity. We can't compute with infinities, but can reliably approach the number by using ever larger values for the parameter. So while we can't approximate them to a given accuracy, we can still kinda get consistently better approximations with unknown precision.

[],CatpainTpyos,,,[],,,,text,t2_11a1lo,False,,"**TL;DR:** Compression algorithms typically find patterns in the binary data and shorten the file that way, and they also have other ways of eliminating information that the user probably won't notice is missing anyway.

One very common method of file compression employs a bit of ""pattern recognition."" Suppose you had the following (essentially nonsensical) message:

* Apple Banana Carrot Apple Banana Carrot Apple Banana Carrot Banana Banana Banana Banana Apple Banana Carrot Apple Banana Carrot Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Apple Banana

If you wanted to shorten this message, you could look for repeated bits and replace them by something shorter, and include an explanation of what the shortened strings stand for, so the recipient can ""undo"" the compression. I see the substring ""Apple Banana Carrot"" appears a lot, so I'll replace that by ABC:

* ABC ABC ABC Banana Banana Banana Banana ABC ABC Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Apple Banana

""Carrot Apple"" appears a lot too, so I'll replace that with ""CA"":

* ABC ABC ABC Banana Banana Banana Banana ABC ABC CA CA CA CA Apple Banana

Then I can further shorten it by grouping together repeated bits:

* (ABC)x3 (Banana)x4 (ABC)x2 (CA)x4 Apple Banana

By doing these replacements, I've shortened the message a great deal. Even after I include the information to allow a computer to back-substitute, this would still result in a shorter message than what I started with.

More broadly, every computer file, regardless of type is actually stored on your hard drive as a binary bitstring - a long series of 1s and 0s. If the compression algorithm can find particular strings that appear a lot, it can make substitutions like what I did above, potentially saving a lot of file space.
Now, obviously the exact methods of compression vary from algorithm to algorithm, but this serves as a general example of the types of methods they might use.

Thinking about this type of substitution-based algorithm, it should be clear that larger files take longer to compress simply because they have more ""stuff"" for the computer to look over to even find the patterns in the first place, and then they have more ""stuff"" to replace too.

There's also another type of compression that some image formats use. The most straightforward way to store a picture is to simply store it as an n-by-m map of pixels and record each pixel's color. This is what's known as a bitmap and you might be familiar with this type of file (.BMP) as that's what MS-Paint defaults to. Because this format records exact color information of *every* pixel, there's absolutely zero loss of information when saving the file, but the trade-off is the file sizes can get big fast. I believe BMP files don't even use any pattern-based compression either, further bloating their file size.

To counteract this, a group of programmers working at Compuserve in 1987 invented the Graphics Interchange Format (.GIF). Most famously GIFs allow for animated images, although that wasn't true initially. At the start, it was simply a way to compress images to make them easier to store on computers' very limited hard drive space or to send to other people.

In addition to employing the pattern-based compression detailed above, the Compuserve team improved upon the bitmap by reducing the number of colors available to use. Bitmaps stored the exact color information of every pixel as a triplet of numbers describing how much red, how much green, and how much blue comprised the color. This allowed for a grand total of 256^(3) or over 16 million unique colors. But the Compuserve team noticed that most of these colors weren't really needed because end users couldn't tell the difference between a light purple (187, 0, 187) and a *slightly* lighter purple (189, 0, 189). The Compuserve team limited GIFs to a palette of 256 available colors (though each separate file has its own set of 256 colors), which allowed for much smaller file sizes while still limiting the information loss to what they felt was an acceptable amount.

Subsequent work on the GIF format introduced the ability to have animation. This was achieved in a really clever way. Rather than naively storing the image information for each frame of the animation, which would quickly get costly in terms of storage space, developers decided to instead look at the differences between frames. If, for instance, the image was of a winking smiley face, most of the face stays the same across frames, and only the one eye and the area immediately surrounding it changes. Essentially, an animated GIF stores the initial image and then a list of directions of how to change the image from frame to frame.

Many other compression algorithms exist for other types of files, but I'm not familiar enough with how they work to get into detail.

These descriptions contains enough information to recreate the original data. In the worst case if it does not find any patterns at all it only needs to say there is no patterns and then output the original data which only adds a few bytes to the size. However the more patterns it finds the smaller the compressed data becomes as the description of the patterns is much smaller then the original data.

Finding these patterns take a lot longer then to just follow the descriptions of the patterns so compression takes more time and resources then decompression. Similarly if you have a lot of data there is a lot more possible patterns which means the compression takes longer. Compression algorithms tends to have a setting where you can decide how much time it should spend looking for patterns which can speed up the process but creates larger output. How much the data compresses is also depending on the data. If there is a lot of random data like an encrypted file then there are no patterns to find meaning the data will not compress much.

Around 14 quadrillion years for the processor i calculated it against a few years ago(one processor in one computer in someones garage).

But when it comes to analysis....

Does every permutation need to be generated? no, just the ones up to the 12 character key.

The example before of 12 characters is around 96 bits. The number of possibilies represented by 2048 bits is **FUCKING MASSIVE**! The thing with binary is 97 bits isnt one more than 96 bits, 97 bits is *twice* as big as 96 bits. So yeah, 96 compared to 2048, **FUCKING MASSIVE**!

BUT! *Can* some douch with a bunch of strung together computers break the encryption? **IF** time is not an issue(it is) and **IF** nothing changes in the encryption algorithm(it does, a lot. cycling keys is a thing for a reason) the answer is always yes.

Do you need to worry about it? As long as you make sure youre using HTTPS (and preferably VPNs on public/untrusted networks) you have very little to worry about.

This puzzle can in practice only be solved by lots and lots of guessing, so your chances of ""winning"" are directly proportional to your processing power. Once a puzzle is solved, the algorithm immediately creates the next one.

The reason why these puzzles are so hard (and therefore use so much processing power which in turn means electricity) comes from the aforementioned 10 minutes: If the algorithm sees that the puzzles are solved faster than that, it automatically increases the difficulty of the next ones, in order to keep the intended 10-minute-cycle. Miners who want to increase their chances of getting these sweet, sweet 12.5BTC will buy more hardware which uses more electricity, but if everyone does that, the algorithm will just make the puzzle even harder.

Now, these 12.5BTC are currently worth more than $100.000. The system just gives out more than a hundred thousand dollars every ten minutes! Now, think about this econoically: Lets assume, as an example, that you own a HUGE farm that racks up an enormous electricity bill of A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS per day! And because other people have even bigger ones, that still gives you only a tiny chance of 1% of cracking any given puzzle first. Well, since there are 144 puzzles each day, and every win nets you more than $100.000, this seemingly ridiculous thing still nets you a sizeable profit!

A hash is an algorithm that you put a lot of data into it and it spits out a number. It's really hard to figure out what data you need to put into it in order to get a specific output. The fastest way is just guess until you get it right.

In the above example, you make your bitcoin, then pick a random number, and compute the hash. If the hash ends in 10 zeros then you have made 1BTC and you announce it to the world (and hope that nobody beat you in the last second or so), if not you not you just try again. And if someone announces a new bitcoin, then you need to update your last hash.

Credit is literally another person giving you money, like a car loan or a credit card. When AT&amp;T gives you cell phone service and charges you $100 at the end of the month, they're not actually missing a hundred bucks themselves. They're just charging you for a service that might have cost them only $8 to provide to you.

Your credit score is intended to be a measure of how likely you are to pay back someone who has lent you money.

Now, if AT&amp;T sends your bill to collections, that's a signal that you have money problems and that will impact your credit score negatively because, you know, you seem to have money problems.

On the flip side, if a hospital sends your medical bill to collections, the credit bureaus won't hold that against you. They understand just as we all do that medical bills are outrageously ridiculous and the fact that you were hit by a car and an ambulance costs $12,000 has nothing to do with how reliable of a borrower you are. 

So that's nice.

Meanwhile, the flip side to that is that if you got in a car accident, your insurance company WOULD hold it against you and raise your rates, because you're a person that gets accidents.

These things are just formulaic algorithms at the end of the day and the credit bureaus aren't trying to make it hard for you. No one wants to needlessly lower your credit score. Banks want to know if you are a good investment, so credit bureaus to don't want to suggest that you aren't if you actually are.

It's just raw number crunching. If paying your normal bills on time was a statistically significant way of determining whether or not a person will pay back a loan, then credit bureaus would factor that into their algorithm. But they have done the research and the math and they have determined that that just isn't a very strong indicator.

It makes sense, too, when you think about it. Generally speaking, everyone can afford their bills or else they wouldn't have the bills in the first place. If you couldn't afford your cell phone bill then after 90 days or so the cell phone service is just going to cut you off.

So most people, knock on wood, have bills that are lower than their income and they can pay their bills and that doesn't tell you much.

\+++

A completely different way of looking at it is that paying your bills on time DOES help your credit score, relative to your peers who don't pay their bills and get sent to collections. Your score will remain the same and theirs will go down, and you are now a more attractive borrower.

The score doesn't tell which ones will do well, less well, or poorly, but it does a god job of predicting what will happen with the group.

Again looking at groups, those who use credit cards spend 15-18% more than those who use cash; that's one of the primary reasons credit card acceptance has grown so much over the last 30+ years.

[],DarkAlman,,,[],,,,text,t2_99y1x,False,,"This isn't exactly how this works, but I'm using it as an example just to explain the principal.

Imagine you have a picture in a file. Computers don't store pictures, they store instructions on how to re-create a picture.

So the file contains a lot of data like the following:

1 1 255 0 0

Which translated means Pixel 1,1 will be color 255,0,0 (Which in RGB is Red)

This is repeated over and over again in the file to create an image

1 1 255 0 0 1 2 255 0 0 1 3 255 0 0 1 4 255 0 0

In this case this particular color is repeated over and over again

So the compression algorithm will store that color instruction once and replace the entries with a small placeholder

Let's call is C1 (Stored compressed color 1)

So the file will look like this

C1 = 255 0 0

1 1 C1 1 2 C1 1 3 C1 1 4 C1

So over the length of the File that placeholder takes up less space than the original color. You can then go further with a shortcut

C1 = 255 0 0

1 &gt; 4 C1

So with these instructions you can do the same thing as the original

1 1 255 0 0 1 2 255 0 0 1 3 255 0 0 1 4 255 0 0

Most governments (I assume you live in the US where this is the case) have ISPs (Internet Service Providers) implement certain algorithms that flags some predetermined keywords and patterns in their users internet activity. Though many ISPs only does the bare minimum they have to by law and these ISPs will also fight for their users right to privacy.  
  
As for companies, just recently Apple and Google has stopped using humans to go through recordings (small snippets) of users voice activity (using their virtual assistants or from phonecalls) which is now done by a machine.  
Microsoft however is still using actual humans fro this process.
(the process is to make their AIs better and they do their best to anonymize the data collected).  
  
Companies like Google and Facebook however tracks pretty much everything you do online (they have some special cookies they use to track where you go after visiting their sites or sites that has anything from their services embedded, look up supercookie for more info).  
This info is tied to your Facebook account or your personal fingerprint (Google has developed an algorithm to track people based on their internet usage patterns), however both companies have systems available where you can get the stored data cleared. (they also sell this data, but anonymize it first).   
  
That is some ways you are being tracked online, there are many more ways to track people and ""spy"" on them, though mostly it's just used for statistics and nothing that is actually tied to you specifically.  
  
(Again I want to say that I'm not anywhere close to an expert on the subject, but after having worked briefly at a major ISP in my country and have a general interest in these things, this is what I can tell you off the top of my head.).
  
  
OBS: writing this as I just finished the post and I don't want to go back and try to fit it in.  
When ISPs run data through these algorithms it's usually only every X package as it would be way too resource intensive to look at all the traffic.

The fields themselves are at right angles to each other a well as the direction of travel so lets say the electric field is up and down and the magnetic field is left and right while the direction of travel is forward. In this case the cycle looks something like this:

1. When the electric field is increasing upwards, it pushes the magnetic field to the right.
2. When the magnetic field is increasing to the right, it pushes the electric field down.
3. When the electric field is increasing downwards, it pushes the magnetic field left.
4. When the magnetic field is increasing to the left, it pushes the electric field up.

and you're back at 1 so the cycle repeats.

This cycle of the electric and magnetic fields pushing each other back and forth as they travel forward together is fundamentally what light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation is.
