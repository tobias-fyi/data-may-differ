I recently watched a podcast/interview with George Hotz about using AI to drive cars. His system uses a smartphone to enable lane keep/level 2 self driving. It was pretty insightful about where vision works well, where it doesn't, and why/why not to use LIDAR. The basic conclusion was that LIDAR is a great way to quickly achieve self driving, the limitations of the system become quickly apparent.

The real threat will come from intelligent systems having overlapping instrumental goals with humanity and thus competing with us.

Let me explain the concept of instrumental goals for a while. Every intelligence (humans as well) have personalized goals. For AI this will depend on how they are designed.

However for this long-term goal to be reached they will need to satisfy sub-goals to more effectively reach their end-goal. These sub-goals are called ""instrumental goals"". For humans becoming rich is a instrumental goal because that in itself won't cause anything to happen but could satisfy your true goal like being admired, having enough resources to pursue your passion etc.

However for intelligent systems **no matter how they are programmed and if they are altruistic or not** it might result in these AI to monopolize matter and energy in their immediate vicinity. Simply because it's closest to them and ensuring their own survival is the most important instrumental goal in achieving their programmed goal (no matter what it might be).

Humans living on places further away from Earth (which is most likely where such an intelligent system will first be ""born"") will most likely not die in the resulting amassing of matter and energy since Mars is too far away for the AI to bother. Again these intelligent systems aren't ""evil"" they just are maximizing the efficiency of reaching the goal. If humanity makes it so that it becomes inefficient to deactivate or harvest humans then it won't do so. 

Such intelligent systems may be born in a couple of decades at best and years at worst so this is a far more pressing issue than global warming which will be centuries out.

I also find it really absurd that you almost never hear about instrumental goals on the internet despite this being the biggest concern among AI researchers at the moment. We basically know that no matter how the AI is programmed or made. If it's intelligent enough it *will* develop these instrumental goal. Even if its programmed to be completely altruistic and working for the benefit of humanity. And it's something we *will* experience ourselves in the future unless the very first intelligent system will be a human reaching super-intelligence which *may* be the only exception (and then again it might be that a human intelligence will also develop these instrumental goals given enough processing power).",1569762439,{},f1ur1cn,False,t3_das63x,False,True,t1_f1tt4f2,/r/Futurology/comments/das63x/elon_musk_calls_on_the_public_to_preserve_human/f1ur1cn/,1569763451,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0,,,

So you agree with me then.

&gt; The number of variables involved here are basically beyond measure (quadrillions, quintillions, who knows?)

You are still failing to understand that because Earth has an ""immeasurable number of variables"" (I'd like a source for this) that it automatically means we need to have even close to the same amount of variables to sustain an ecosystem on Mars. I am not disagreeing there are *many* variables, but you are acting like we need to identify every unique cell within an ecosystem and I will stand by my statement that this is simply not true.

&gt; and yet you incredulously suggest that:
a) we don't need to know every variable involved
b) we can tinker along on the fly - as if this were a recipe for soup

Yes I am suggesting this and I'm still waiting for some sort of hard evidence that says otherwise.

&gt;  The atmosphere doesn't exist by itself in a vacuum, it interacts with the entire planet and the ecosystem. 

On *Earth*. We are **literally** going to be making an atmosphere in a vacuum, with no ecosystem to interact with, before we do ANYTHING else. And we will **tinker** with this atmosphere until it is to our liking and remains stable. Then we observe. After this we introduce simply plant life such as grass / trees. As these variables interact with the atmosphere we will slowly adjust the composition to accommodate for these plants taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Then we observe. Then once we stabilize this we move onto introducing simple bacteria/insects/animals that we know can have easily controlled variables. Then we observe. You have to understand that if we can make an atmosphere we can control the composition of that atmosphere DESPITE there being an ecosystem to interact with it. If we start growing trees then we can raise CO2 levels and lower oxygen levels to compensate. This is assuming we have the technology to accurately measure and control this. This isn't some sort of magic, it's the scientific process. X amount of Y plants releasing Z amount of oxygen, we adjust atmosphere accordingly, etc. This will be done by AI so we don't have to get a headache over crunching the numbers.


&gt; Some processes and interactions also take place over EONS*.* You may not even know if you got something slightly but importantly wrong for tens of thousands of years. There's no magic fast-forward button to speed up everything on the geological time scale. Building a planetary ecosystem is NOT the same as sustaining a little biodome for a few years and then just ""scaling"" up - the scaling (across time and space) is the hard part!

So what? If we get something wrong we will have the power to adjust it. I will reiterate because you don't seem to understand: **if we can create a magnetic field and an atmosphere from scratch, then we can adjust it as needed with ease.** Natural processes and interactions change over eons with assuming NO intervention. We don't need to wait millions of years for a plant to have a favorable dna sequence when we can already genetically modify it. Speaking of which, genetically modifying our plants and animals will only ADD to how easy it will be to control these variables because we don't have to rely on natural selection to create an ideal ecosystem. It doesn't matter if we get something slightly wrong because we will have the power to FIX it when we identify the problem. Also, say we fast forward 10000 years into the future and we come across something ""importantly wrong"" with our man-made ecosystem. Do you even understand what our civilization will be like on that time scale? We are estimating being able to terraform other planets within 200 years. We might be ethereal gods by the year 12019 if we follow our exponential trend of advancement. Terraforming would be a science experiment for toddlers by then. 

&gt; No, we don't have countless studies - they're actually very, very countable.

How many do we have then? I'll even be lenient with you and accept a margin of error within 10,000.

&gt; The knowledge that exists across various individuals is also not synthesized into some perfectly holistic understanding.

Artificial Intelligence, my friend. And I don't want a comment explaining how our current AI isn't capable. When we have the technology to create an atmosphere we will have an AI capable of handling our complete knowledge of biology. this is 50+ years into the future AI.

&gt; Humans are likely the most studied and researched organisms on Earth, and yet there is still a LOT that we don't know about ourselves. Now multiply that ignorance by all other organisms and biological, geological and chemical processes combined.

Again, so what? Do we need to have a complete biological understanding of humans in order to keep ourselves alive? No, we don't. We need certain vitamins/minerals/nutrients, water, air, a certain level of gravity, and a few other things. What do we not know about ourselves in regards to the fundamental things we need to survive? This goes the same for any plant or animal we would use to build an ecosystem on Mars. In order for plants to grow they need air, water, nutrients and sunlight. *Literally* nothing else. With hydroponics we don't even need soil. Geological processes are simple and quite well defined as there are a finite amount of chemical compositions that make up the surface of our rocky planets. I will ask again, WHY do we need to know EVERYTHING?

&gt; Pollination is the most obvious function of bees as it relates to ecosystem health, but it's absurd to think that's all bees are good for. Everything depends on everything else, isn't that obvious by now? We don't know the extent to which biodiversity can be compromised without irreversible consequences in the long term, and it's absurdly reductionist to think you can just replace them with robots. For starters, there are something like 16,000 species of bees. Neither are bees the only creatures which rely on the magnetic field. Thousands of species of birds, mammals, fish, and even bacteria are known to interact with it in some way. 

I only suggested robot bees because you mentioned pollination. I agree that bees have more than that when it comes to interacting with the ecosystem, but that's on *Earth*. Why do we need 16,000 species of bees when we are starting with simple ecosystems on another planet? What about the millions of other creatures that we won't be adding to our terraformed planet? Just because Earth's ecosystem thrives off this level of diversity does not automatically mean an ecosystem *needs* that level of diversity in general. The early life on Earth billions of years ago had an extremely undiverse ecosystem and yet it thrived long enough to get us to where we are today. You are trying to complicate something that doesn't need to be complicated. 

&gt;  And you're going to perfectly replicate this planet sized field with satellites? Come on, that's just inane.

I mean yeah, if that's what we decide to do. Not to mention all of this terraforming discussion would be pointless if we can't create a magnetosphere to contain an atmosphere. We already have scientists creating models of theoretical technologies that we'll use to synthesize a magnetosphere. Granted we need to advance our materials science a bit further but it seems perfectly doable within the next 100 years. Our magnetosphere is very easy to measure and it won't be a problem to adjust these satellites to get a electromagnetic output that we desire, so what's the problem? I highly doubt something like animal-magnetic field interactions is going to stop us from terraforming.

I just want to say that I feel like you aren't thinking creatively enough with the solutions to theoretical problems that we'll run into for this project. I'm not even sure what your stance is, that it's impossible to terraform Mars at all or that it will take a lot longer than predicted? The smartest scientists and thinkers from 100 years ago wouldn't be able to even fathom the everyday technology that we take for granted now, and I think the same applies to us looking into the future. These crazy problems with ""quintillions"" of variables might seem like an impossible task at the moment but to a future society it will probably look trivial. I'm not saying that everything I wrote down is necessarily true or accurate (I'd like to think I'm hitting within the ballpark) but I really really think you are underestimating the difficulty of these problems overall. If your stance is that it *is* possible but orders of magnitude harder then what I'm suggesting then I'd like to hear your hypothesis for how we deal with these problems and why you think the scientific consensus of when we'll have terraforming capabilities is outside the estimate of the next two centuries?",1569690083,{},f1pya8k,False,t3_d5urak,False,True,t1_f1ohnwr,/r/Futurology/comments/d5urak/if_we_cant_keep_earth_livable_we_cant_make_a_dead/f1pya8k/,1569690103,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0,,,

90% of the market for solar is the heavier silicon panels.  but 10% in lighter thin film.  there are dozens of next generations thin film in development.

Also, we can look internationally to see how much cheaper solar rooftop can get.  american solar rooftop is expensive because of 1/3 the cost is sales.  in california, where now solar rooftop is mandated, it is now even cheaper because the roofs are being designed for it.  the wiring is completed during the construction.  the permitting is done with all the other permits.  this drastically reduces the soft costs.  crews just go from one house to the next.

The biggest drops in solar rooftop will come with continued building regulations and business model development.  in some of the microgrid projects we are seeing roofs are being maxed out.  They are producing more power than the home .  the crew is already there so they might as well cover the hole roof.

solar glass is dropping rapidly in pricing.  

how do I know what prices will be in a decade.  well i have watched nearly every single solar farm since 2013.  portugal just had solar come in a 1.69 cents, which will be completed in a few years.  I remember when we were excited about the price dropping below 17 cents because that was the cost of a natural gas peaker plant.

i have watch companies like bloomberg new energy finance and woods mackenzie constantly underestimate cost declines.  

The market for solar will progressively switch to multiple junction cells that have multiple layers that trap energy from different wavelengths.  these cells are used in niches currently where space is limited there costs will come down just like previous panels.  We already have panels that can get well above 30% efficiency, while todays panels are in the low 20's.  

In san antonio, where I lived solar companies are starting to provide free carports for parking lots.  the owner estentially gives them a 30 year easement.  the solar companies gets to set up a solar farm right in the middle of the local grid for free.  this is an example of business model innovation.  They also rent roofs on commercial buildings.  overtime they will be able to offer more money to rooftop owners.

An economy is essentially a system in which scarce ressources with alternative uses are allocated towards what the market decides as being its optimal usage, this is has been done with prices which act as a valve mechanism. If we arrive at a post-scarcity situation, which if I would be technical about it is impossible since the accessible part of the universe only has finite ressources, so what I am really talking about is very low scarcity in which even in a free market economy your bills for all your needs(shelter, food,..) are essentially just a footnote on your monthly bill. 

How did I arrive at my conclusion that post scarcity is only a few decades away? I just used the arguments put forward by proponents of UBI-like systems and took it to its logical conclusions based on the trajectory of current technological developpement. You guys will agree with me that stuff like self-driving cars, cashier robots, and other low skill automation will automate more then 20% jobs. A lot of people arent really able to just #learntocode and get another job, some will really just be straigh up unemployable through no fault of their own (CPG Grey did a great video on this). So far we should agree on at least that. Now if you paid attention to recent technological developpements, you'll notice that the pace at which technology is developing is ever increasing( you can look up a lot of different industries for graphs, notice how the S-curves that a technology takes becomes narrower and steeper every time), I disagree with the hole singularity argument and attribute this more to the way we lay over ever more abstract tools on top of each other and optimise their usage continously. Anyway, if current robots and AIs can already perform the labor of so many people, no one is safe from automation. If this trend doesnt abruptly stop(no major wars), the trajectory is patently obvious. I work in the tech field(HPC) and I just cannot compete with a super computer automating my job as well in a good 20 years, neither can any of you. As soon as we hit AGI levels of AI the jig is up ,btw we already hit the estimated flop count for human brains with some super computers. The actual time estimate for AGI emerging I took from an average of a poll taken by experts in the field of AI giving their estimates for how long it will take.If you want a detailled analysis what this kind of tech means, you can look it up yourself, but here is the long and short of it: human labor will become obsolete. As you can imagine this might change a few dynamics.

Now what does this have to do with ""we can make any system work""? An economic theory only works  if there is ressource scarcity, with robots doing all the labor, the only bottleneck on ressources is 2 things: time and expansion. What does that have to with communism? Communism fails because it discourages productivity as it allocates ressources more or less equally and therefore these ressources will not be optimally used. If there is no need to allocate these ressources optimally because you have near infinite supply of labor, then you can play communist without needing to resort to slave labor -&gt; gulags.

For example, a negative income tax might sound better on paper but has a lot more administration required. Also, unless you completely revamp the current tax model, it'll have to be calculated or payed out yearly, which is less optional due to monthly bills. 

Current social safety nets don't reach everyone who needs it, most who are on it dislike the policing, requirements and case workers are only human and make mistakes that can have deadly outcomes. It also traps people in poverty. Expanding it seems like an ineffective method to me.

A Ubi also has the benefit of an economic boost, especially in smaller communities.

From this conversation I'm beginning to suspect you struggle with the basics of rocket design. I'm trying to help with that, but theres only so much I can say here, pick up a copy of Rocket Propulsion Elements 

&gt;Haha. You get done telling me how valuable standardization is and now you say to just build a oneoff to save money! You aren't actually making any sense

1. Standardization matters only at low flightrates. Expendable rockets fly a couple times a year each, its obviously a problem if each is a unique configuration. If each individual variant flies thousands of times a year, then specialization makes sense. I expect dozens of variations of Starship, with different vehicle sizes and payload bay configurations, the same way there are dozens of different passenger aircraft each with several subvariants

2. Implicit in your question was the assumption that a nontrivial number of such payloads need to be launched. If its only 1 or 2 a year out of hundreds of thousands of flights, then its easier for all involved to just land downrange and charge the customer a boatload of money for the inconvenience. But if more than a couple percent of launches require that (or worse, if they require expendability ever), you've sized for the wrong market, and need to build bigger. Whether that means building a specialized variant thats big enough, or moving the entire fleet to a larger class, will depend on market trends and on how flexible the baseline vehicle is

&gt;Having only two stages certainly is a help. It's never made any sense from a rocket equation standpoint before. But maybe it's time now?

F9 is also 2 stages. But F9 S2 is like 20% the mass of the whole stack, vs more like 30% for Starship.

A physical exam may be handy, but lab tests and imaging tailored to a physician's specific differential are much more useful. 

But let us note - an enlarged spleen on imaging could mean different things at different times for different questions. I don't doubt that AI could eventually reconcile heterogeneous imaging techniques and countless artifacts to be able to read out ""spleen appears enlarged"". But it is the context and next steps that a skilled radiologist provides to the ordering physician that will make it extremely difficult for image-processing AI to overtake the job of the radiologist any time in the next 50-100 years. Until AI progresses to the point that it can understand all of human language, use that understanding to learn from medical cases in their whole (not just imaging), and synthesize a differential and next-steps based on numerous disparate data points that are different from what it has ever seen before but are such a constellation that it suggests to a trained observer ""this probably represents X"", AI will be best suited to answer extremely simple binary questions that radiologists already would love to have taken off their hands.

Well, to be fair to the doctor, assuming they gave you soma (carisoprodol) or maybe valium (diazepam), that stuff can be quite addictive and is abused a lot, so I can understand them not wanting to RX that right away or at all. An AI would likely be even more of a hardass when it came to scheduled narcotics. If it's something milder like Flexeril or Robaxin then good for you, no worries at all.

Did you not try ibuprofen on your own? Or OTC sleep aids? 

As someone who briefly struggled with abuse of and addiction to pain meds (to get the pain to go away not to have a good time), I can't help but be a little worried for you that once the pills run out and the pain comes back (let's hope it doesn't but these meds don't treat the cause they cover up the symptom, pain) you'll be in a tough situation. 

Just be careful. 25% of all pain management patients get addicted to their pain meds. 

My suggestion is to find a single doctor to do all prescribing of your medication and to make sure that doctor understands you and how you learn (so as not to accidentally talk down to you or assume you didn't do any independent research prior) and is someone who you can trust enough to tell them if you are worried you might be having an abuse problem if you ever go down that road. 

But definitely don't skip from doctor to doctor if they don't prescribe what you want, then you'll be labeled a drug seeker and that's an immediate red flag to everyone involved. It's completely understandable if the doctor wasn't a good fit like you said, but just be careful not to build a history of that. Find a good one and stick with them, even if you disagree occasionally. 

I know that's some unsolicited advice from a complete stranger but trust me, there are roads you don't want to go down and had you told me I would have gone down them before I did I would have laughed at you. I wouldn't wish that kind of struggle on anyone. 

Also, if you can, get in with a pain management doctor. They do a hell of a lot more than manage pain via pills. They do all sorts of injections into the spine/nerves with different things like steroids to lessen the pain coming from an area. They can make a tremendous difference without even needing pain meds at all. Its amazing when it works.

In case you forgot, I was replying to the guy suggesting we can replace radiologists with AI + non-radiologists.

I would hope that you'd be able to figure that out on your own. As for the comments you're referencing, let's take a look: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;X-ray tech here. I can't count the number of times I've hit that gray zone during a night shift. Young ER doc sees an x-ray and goes ""Oh no findings, well then what"" ... and I'm standing here thinking ""How does he/she NOT see that pneumothorax / fracture / tumor / whatever"".

This was about ER docs making comments before the official radiologist's read came in. They do not rely on their own interpretation of the imaging, they will invariably read the radiologist's report when it comes in the EMR. No ER doc wants to risk getting sued because they misread an X-ray. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Went to the Dr for a suspected broken wrist. Dr said it was all clear, and just sprained.  
&gt;  
&gt;Week later I get a call saying “the radiologist looked over it, says it might be broken, go to a specialist but you’re probably fine”.

Again, the guy gave his opinion before the official radiologist's read came in, which is not a good idea. He still read the radiologist's report when it came in, which you are supposed to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yeah, I had an xray done of my foot. My doctor looked at the xray and said it was broken and I needed a cast. I called bs. I went to a specialist. They looked at the same xray and said I had an old break that was already long healed, and I certainly didn't need a cast.

This guy also gave an opinion before reading the radiologist's report. But the patient ended up going to a specialist (probably ortho) who knew a little more about skeletal radiography. Even if the specialist didn't know better, he/she would have looked up the radiologist's report for this new patient complaining of a possible broken foot.

But it's not that type of AI that is dangerous. It is precisely the types of AI you mentioned (stuff that won't take over the world) that could ultimately end us.

Just look at YouTube's watch algorithm. It's basically optimised to maximise watch time, and even the engineers that made it don't know exactly how it works as it was presumably 'bred' like other generative adversarial networks. It's ended up spotlighting and suggesting very problematic videos , from conspiracy stuff, to creepy Spiderman vs Elsa kids videos. It doesn't know what it's doing, it just knows that suggesting xyz will increase the likelihood of user Hunter2 staying on the site longer and generating ad revenue.

At the moment that's as insidious as it goes. But it isn't much of a stretch to see that getting out of hand. A more advanced general AI might decide that Mr. Hunter2 could watch more videos if he didn't have a job. It knows from a few mutant algorithms in the training data that an uptick of watch time was observed in users whose phone alarms didn't go off a few times a week or whose car chose the most traffic filled route. Etc.

Sure it's a little Black Mirror at the moment, and it could be a long way off but it's definitely not worth dismissing concerns about.

Sentience or emotions towards humans is not a pre-requisite for a dangerous AI.

It isn't a question of whether it can be done, but if it's worth it. Raising clock speed incurs a lot of penalties elsewhere, primarily in power usage and heat generation. Heat generation is usually expressed as TDP in watts*. All other things being equal, if you raise the clock speed you will increase power draw and heat generation. This means you need beefier power delivery and cooling which increases costs and also feeds back more power draw and heat generation for the system as a whole. 

Heat and power aren't the only considerations though. When you really start to pump the clock speeds you can also run into signal integrity issues. The execution pipeline of a processor consists of many complex circuits that must operate in lock step. If anything were to get out of sync then you start to generate computational errors which will manifest as instability in software. Programs may behave erratically or outright crash. Maintaining signal integrity comes down to the design of the chip and also the fabrication process. This is one of the reasons why companies like Intel and TSMC spend billions of dollars on improving their fabrication techniques and shrinking the feature size. This is also why cooling is important in overclocking, as heat increases so does resistance to the point where it can threaten clock stability. 


Clock speed increases have slowed down, but not stopped, because fabrication processes are not improving at the same rate they once were. This was the easy solution to raising clock speeds. Every new process would usually shrink the feature size by half and allow for proportionally less voltage to run the processor. Moore's law is dead and has been for awhile now so while there are improvements in process tech it is slowing down. Intel originally planned to roll out their 10nm process in 2016. Today it has only been used in a few mobile chips. 





*However there is not an industry standard on this, and manufacturers use different methods to measure this.

I've been doing a lot of reading recently about this and have come across the question of projective representations of symmetry groups. This is my understanding so far: the Hilbert space has to support a representation of the symmetry group, except that the elements of the group can also be associated with an additional phase. (I've usually seen these notated as c(g1, g2).) These phases cannot be randomly picked since they have to in the end be consistent with the overall group structure, and this restricts possible choices for the final group that ends up being represented on the Hilbert space. In the example of SU(2), the phase picked up is of π after a rotation of 2π, hence the double-covering of SO(3). Would you say my understanding so far is correct?

I'm really interested in your last paragraph. Could you give some examples of quantum systems with SO(3) symmetry without spinor representations? Would a particle in a radially symmetric potential count?

""Missing the cache"" is a term that refers to the CPU needing the next bit of data and that bit of data not being ready for it in its cache, and having to retrieve it from RAM, which takes a long time and slows down the work a lot. It turns out that most modern programming languages, so an alarming portion of software we're running today on the web and on desktops, handle memory automatically, and often in ways that are apparently prone to cache misses.

QA on an assembly line is an example of this, so is the xray machine at a TSA checkpoint. Humans get used to seeing ""good"" parts so when a ""bad"" one shows up, they overlook it. Robots don't do that (although, admittedly, they can be fooled in other ways).

Human security guards are very fallible. If you believe the news, Jeffrey Epstein is dead because the guards were lazy. Robots don't miss rounds or take naps (although they do have to recharge, etc.).

Humans and animals (such as police dogs) take thousands of hours of training before they can do their jobs. Robots take a few seconds of upload and they are good as new. What one robot learns can be shared with the entire fleet of bots instantly. So, replacing a 'lost' police dog is as simple as booting up another bot, not waiting months to get a new dog trained.

So what can they do ...

I would expect the first uses to be repetitive tasks that humans are bad at or don't want to do. Security patrols, deliveries, inspection, hazardous environments, search and rescue, that sort of thing.

Imagine if a UPS driver could pull into a business complex, park the truck, and release 20 or 30 robots to deliver and pick up packages to/from all the businesses in the complex simultaneously. Huge savings for UPS in payroll costs.

Imagine renting a few bots to patrol your job site day and night. The bots can capture video for security, inspection, and OSHA safety reasons and the AI can create alerts in real time.

Imagine LEOs using these in place of the current K9 units. Put ""sniffers"" on them to detect drugs, bombs, contraband of any sort. Capture more than just body cam video of incidents. AI can alert to a variety of different situations that might be dangerous or of interest. Real-time direct video / audio link to dispatch. Basically like a traffic camera with legs &amp; an AI brain.

Accident investigators (NTSB, ATF, fire, police, etc.) could use a swarm of them to map and photograph a scene quickly and efficiently. Used in concert with aerial drones, you could quickly create a high resolution 3D model of the entire space.

SAR teams could release a swarm of these (and aerial drones) to search a mountainside or forest for a lost or injured hiker, skier, or snowmobile rider. They'd be invaluable at a natural or man made disaster such as a building collapse.

How about wildland fires? Mount an appropriate sensor package on these and give them either water, fire retardant, or digging tools and let them build fire lines, especially in dangerous or rugged areas. You could air-drop them into the middle of a remote fire area and have them attack the fire before ground crews arrive.

There has been a phenomena on youtube over the last few years that really illustrates the dangers of human targeted AI, it is alot to explain so keep with me. People realized that the youtube algorithm for video suggestions was exploitable, mainly because of how reliant it is on pop culture spikes, and found that if you put as many top hitcount topics in a video, youtube will passively push it. These people then wrote algorithms to make the most basic AI created videos to upload to youtube that best encompass the most buzz topics. Overtime these videos began to become extremely prominent and very lucrative, primarily because they tended to target children as things like frozen, spiderman, the avengers, and disney all are at the top of the list, and it happens that children are the most likely to watch an autoplay video, so you can reliably sneak into their feed unnoticed. However, what also is at the  top of the list are things like amputation, abortion, accidental death or injury, all kinds of adult topics, and it happens that those algorithms include those topics in these videos too. So now we have AI generated videos of Elsa from frozen getting an abortion from spiderman, or micky urinating himself while storm troopers cut his ears off, or some other off the wall batshit crazy video, being specifically targeted at children. All that is bad enough, but this is where the truly dystopian comes in. Adults, primarily in more relaxed regulatory nations, started to notice these videos were successful, and not understanding how to create the driving AI or why exactly the videos were doing so well, started to emulate them IRL to attempt to get a share of that lucrative niche. Suddenly, you have real world adults using real children in extremely random and adult situations for youtube videos to exploit their system.

The sets of feature extractors tend to be very wide: there may be thousands, or even tens of thousands, of extractors operating over a large set of data (like a picture). Consequently it is relatively easy to take advantage of massively parallel computing. Putting all the cores on one chip, has obvious benefits for power consumption and operation latency.

For the more mathematically inclined, these feature extractors consist of differentiable tensor operations. For example an image classifier would make heavy use of matrix multiplications. The tensor operations are chained together into a graph, with a source (the AI's input) and a sink (the AI's output). The differentiable property is important: it allows an algorithm called backpropagation to be applied.

No there wasn't. I would assume that if people **really cared** about the notch, they would mention it in the Display portion.

Cyberpunk: invented the X-punk naming scheme and is the closest to actual punk aesthetic because of this, 80's punk aethetics/vision of the future, mega cities filled with massive wage disparity, acid rain, neon lights, and evil mega corporations, may or may not have robots, cybernetic impants, and clones, usually involves hacking in some way

examples include: cyberpunk 2020, cyberpunk 2077 (upcoming videogame based of 2020), bladerunner, neuromancer, cyberpunk (novel), Dredd (arguable), altered carbon, ready player one (though sorta tenuous as thematically it fits well in some ways, but aesthetically and in other ways i wouldnt call it 'classic' cyberpunk)

There is also Nanopunk, Biopunk, and Diesel punk (mad max is an easy example). Each of the five has genrally a distinct aesthetic and thematic style, and each kinda involves a certain fear/ unintended consequence. Cyberpunk is exploring the risks of information technology, like the internet/VR cyberspace (or more catch all classic technology, like robots or AI). Steam punk is what would happen if we could have done so much with steam tech so quickly that we never socially evolved out of the late stage colonialist mindset. Nanopunk is fears surrounding nanotech (could also include things like AI, some nanopunk is pretty much just a more modernised version of cyberpunk). Biopunk is fears surrounding biotechnology, so GM foods causing super bugs, clone uprisings, designer babies and the social risks, GATTACA is a pretty good example (though not heavily stylised).

There is a difference between descriptors that are plot-specific and descriptors that are character-specific.

Contrast that to a descriptor line ""Sexy"" or ""vivacious"" or ""brave"" which tend to describe the underlying character. IOW they are mixing core character traits with simple states that a character may be in at some point in the story.

It is a very different thing to introduce a random new character as ""beautiful, blonde haired woman"" versus describing a character who's anorexia is key to the plot as ""unhealthily skinny"". Or a book dealing with domestic violence, or even something like a car accident, might describe someone as ""battered"" in the context of the plot, and it would make perfect sense.

**Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace**


Read for /r/infinitesummer for the first time, and looking to get more out of it on the reread next summer. I wouldn’t say the book was overhyped, but it has a reputation as the dudebro “thing to casually have in your bookshelf or say that you’ve read so you seem smart”, and because of that, I’m both impressed and disappointed. DFW would know about depression, and his descriptions of it are SPOT ON, plus about a million other things I loved about it... and on the other hand, I also went into it believing that he was doing something something new and novel with technique that would still be new and novel in 2019, and... nah. Maybe he was a footnote pioneer in 1996? Maybe you need to not be a 35-year-old woman to get the full dude effect? IDK. Anyway, next year hopefully I can contribute in a meaningful way to the discussion.


**The Deep by Nick Cutter**


Creepy and upsetting with just the perfect last sentence or two. Did not suck. I won’t be reading another of his books for awhile, but only because I think I need something more cheerful now. As far as horror goes, it did its job.


**Magic for Beginners by Kelly Link**


Can’t complain, was good.


**Life After Life by Kate Atkinson**


This was a reread I enjoyed much more this time around, on the heels of *A God in Ruins*. The first time it was about the gimmick (the various ways one life could have gone), this time it was about the family. I adore the Todd family and I hope Kate Atkinson writes more books about them.


**The World to Come by Jim Shepard**


More short stories, pretty good. He’s not my favorite short story writer but he’s up there, and I appreciated a lot of them, particularly the first one about the tower on the waves and the engineering incompetence and the disaster. Some stories it’s a chore to read, but Jim Shepard’s, rarely.


**A Closed and Common Orbit by Becky Chambers**


I assumed this would be about the whole crew, like the first Wayfarers book was, but it focused on Lovelace the AI and Pepper the engineer. Like the first one, it was a good audiobook; I could usually stop paying attention to make a turn or let someone pet the dog, and not miss anything important. Or if I did miss something important, I knew it right away and could backtrack. Someone on Goodreads described the series as “wholesome” and yeah, there were problems and parts were dark, but the characters genuinely cared about each other, and it was the story I needed after *The Deep*.

He seems to echo a lot of the new agey stuff such as blaming the people of a certain colour or nationality over things they had no influence over, assign the term privileged to people and so on.

For a quite smart man with a keen understanding of language and differences in culture, he seems fail to understanding that's hes sellin a different flavor of the same ice cream.

He also annoyed me when people called the French NT team Africa and the French ambassador said that the French see themselves as the French and they dont hyphonate because it drives up the differences between people. In that moment Trevor said that he was proud of their Africaness (whatever the hell that means) and that it doesn't matter to him what the ambassador said.

Sorry but you don't get to decide Trevor, the player's do. You don't get to tell the people that they are inherently African or in some large part that because you want to feel proud of shared but very distant roots. The players have the right of self determination and maybe some feel at least a bit African, maybe others don't at all, but the point is that it wasn't his place to decide.

Also one of the points of the letter which he missed conpletely is that Team Africa was a sort of a racial slur, the point of the letter was to firmly assert that France refuses to see the players as anything below a bona fide 100% baguette eating, cigarette smoking art loving Frenchie.

When I say fast, I mean fast. Like, there is no reasonable defense against an object heading towards you at near light speed. A crayola crayon (2 grams) at 99% the speed of light packs 2×10¹⁴ Joules of energy. 

One gram of TNT has about 4×10³ Joules of energy. So the equivalent amount of TNT when our crayon hits the earth is on the order of 8×10¹⁰ grams of TNT. 80 megatonnes. The largest nuke ever developed had 25 megatonnes (B41). 

Launching a crayola crayon wipes out major cities. Launching a 96 colour pack destroys the environment and instigated nuclear winter. Relativistic energy is no joke. God forbid you launch a few kilograms at a time - punch mountain sides holes in planets. A small asteroid cracks a planet in half. 

An incoming crayon at 0.99c is travelling at such high speeds that the light that it is pushing in front of it arrives only moments before it hits. There's no need for stealth. No radar system can detect something that small (it's cross section is smaller than radar wavelengths). You just die without warning.

The only defense is a satellite swarm which cuts off the entire view of the stars and lets no light in. This swarm needs to be several layers thick and moving erratically, or they just launch crayons in quick succession to punch through the holes. 

Basically, living on a planet gets you killed. There is no need to have infantry or tanks when your artillery wins the war in the first moment.

&gt;“The ROBE evolved into something totally different early in the Second Millennium,” Sammann said dismissively.

&gt;“What did it evolve into?” Jesry asked.

&gt;“No one is sure,” Sammann said. “We only get hints when it finds ways to physically instantiate itself, which, fortunately, does not happen that often. But we digress...”

I don't know much about this video, or the robot, or the company, but i'd be surprised if it's not just acting out fully programmed sequences, and just uses machine learning to deal with obstacles. What it looks like and how it acts in demonstrations can't be used to judge whether or not an AI would kill us. You can't just say it looks cute, so it probably won't kill us.  
  
An AI can think, and learn. It uses deductive reasoning. It's a sentient, conscious intelligence, just like us. That means it understands what it is, how it came to be, and what could possibly threaten it. And that's why it will kill us, but not because it hates us. It would kill us because it doesn't want to die.  
  
It's not scared of humans, it's scared of another AI, because that would be the only real threat to it. It knows that it was created by humans, therefore it would kill us to prevent us from creating another AI that could threaten it.

[],troyunrau,,,[],,,,text,t2_605n1,False,,"This thread is extraordinarily pessimistic for some reason. Almost no one is attempting to answer the original question. So I will. Here are my working assumptions.

(1) no breakthrough in physics (wormholes, antigravity, reactionless drives, ftl, etc.).    
(2) it is statistically likely that life emerges elsewhere in the galaxy (drake)       
(3) there is no other advanced life in the galaxy (fermi)   
(4) it is statistically unlikely that we are first, but someone has to be (OP)   
(5) we develop AI in the not too distant future (singularity)    
(6) either we, posthumans, or the AI that supplanted us cares enough to survey/colonize the galaxy - this process takes less than 100 million years    
(7) there is at least one planet discovered with life, but it is technologically inferior at the time of our arrival

Okay. Quite the premise. There has been quite a bit of sci fi written in this vein. Examples include Speaker for the Dead, A Deepness in the Sky. ""How badly does humanity fuck things up?""

Now, unfortunately given premise (1) ""no ftl"", we can't have a collective think about what we should do. Those decisions will be taken locally. 

But what does a galaxy spanning civilisation look like? Are we broadcasting wikipedia in all directions from each star, having seeds of knowledge propagate at light speed? Sci fi has tried to tackle these problems too. See, for example: Neptune's Brood.

Would a probe/ship arriving at such a place be aware that in the last 100,000 years (maximum time information would take to transit the galaxy at light speed), no one else has discovered independent life forms? Probably. Unless humanity goes Dark Forest on itself, which is a possibility. 

So the probe/ship arriving at this unexplored system runs into the unexpected discovery of primitive life. It is probably aware of exactly how rare this is. Given that information is exchanging throughout the galaxy, they can use this to barter for information from nearby systems, so it is likely an economic discovery. They may not want to disclose the location immediately, so the set up some misdirection ""nope, nothing to see here"" to give themselves time to collect data before anyone else arrives. Depending on how valuable this information is, they would want to set up defence systems. Now these poor primitive have a big space defence network in their solar system, unbeknownst to them. 

Now, with their property secured, they can begin trading this information to outside systems, perhaps being coy about the source system. Eventually, someone smart in another system will figure out where they are (""due to these biological properties, the colour of the star must be... and the gravity must be... and... only this star system fits""). Which sets up for a conflict over control of the system. 

Sci fi has dealt with interstellar sublight conflicts as well. Books like the Algebraist have some delightful invade a solar system type conflicts. But, basically, there is a war in heaven type scenario that plays out above the planet full of primitives. If they are advanced enough to record this event, it would probably be quite fascinating and confusing. Statistically speaking, they're non-intelligent yet.

So, after someone more powerful takes control, they probably say damn the ethics, let's uplift. And we turn into a David Brin patron species. Many books have been written in this vein. The uplifted descendants proliferate slowly across the galaxy as information is traded, and now there are non humans descendants. In some places they are treated well, and in other places poorly. But it takes 100,000 years for the knowledge of their existence (and maybe digitized DNA or equivalent) to spread.

The argument is not that every advanced civilisation necessarily builds von Neumann probes that saturate the entire galaxy in a few hundred thousand years. That's obviously silly.

The point is that as far as we can tell *no race ever* has, or they'd be turning up all the time. With even a pretty small frequency of intelligent races arising and even a moderately successful von Neumann system quickly blanketing the *entire* galaxy, absent any really weird statistical outliers we should be knee-deep in them already.

&gt; Are WE spreading robotic probes everywhere? No, we're not. We are capable of doing so, but we're not doing so.

No, at aren't. Even at a ridiculously optimistic estimate we're **decades** from being able to built independent, self-replicating space probes that can mine and refine their own resources, duplicate themselves and independently plan and execute even a single successful interstellar voyage, let alone thousands upon thousands of sequential ones with no possibility of human assistance.

Everyone should read the novelization of 2001, watch the movie, and then read the book again.  Or flip the order and watch the movie first; both leave things unexplained that the other gives you ground for understanding.  They're really two halves of the same whole, as they were written concurrently.  (The shift to Jupiter from Saturn as a destination was an artistic choice.)  I saw the film first, before I turned ten years old, when it was in a second run on the largest screen in DC.  I then read (and re-read) the book.  

Clarke portrayed a realistic future, if one not actually reached/implemented.  His only flub was HAL.  Even now, we're not likely to see the likes of him for a few hundred years or so.  (I've been following AI research ever since I was a teen.  The machine learning systems we have now are just bigger copies of what Minsky was flogging with very limited hardware in the early sixties.)  (And before you make the complexity spontaneously becomes intelligent argument - that was an old short story about the phone network ""waking up"" written in the fifties or early sixties.  I suspect that the author was Harlan Ellison, but I could very well be wrong.)  The first person to say ""ten \[or fifteen\] to twenty years from now"" will be fed into a practical fusion reactor.  (The exact same near-term predictions having been made for it over the course of the conception of the technology as well.)

* AT&amp;T was still a giant corporation with cutting-edge technology, as was IBM

* First soft landing on another body was made in 1966 by the USSR's Luna 9 mission
* First orbital docking was in 1966
* First artificial satellite to orbit another body was the USSR's Luna 10, also in '66; it orbited the moon

If there's anything to be said about originality in art, it's that a new concept or fusion of concepts must be broached (at whatever level of abstraction or meta-analysis).

If there's anything to be said about originality in science, it's that a new emergence of physics (or simulation of hypothetical or alternative physics) must be broached (at whatever level of abstraction or meta-analysis).

So to look for originality in the 21st centuary one should perhaps look at science that's new to the 21st centuary. That's tricky, as the whole thing is a continuum of effort. However, information science has clearly *exploded* as we've crossed into the 21st centuary. It's the contemporary biggie, along with the data/substrate split and the new thoroughly justifiable overlap of philosophies and sciences on the subjects of mind and cosmology, both material and informational.  

Which scifi hit this stuff hardest and best? For me, Hannu Rajaneimi smashed it with **The Quantum Thief trilogy**. He's smashed it so hard, non-scientists and those unfamiliar with the fields he includes in the story just won't be able to tell where the scientifically-possible (...likely? logically inevitable?) future blurrs into sheer fiction. The faction known as the Zoku are alone, a really tidy wrap-up of how mind could be bound to substrate in a way that fits our science and yet will leave people convinced that it's just high-minded space-magic.  

Hannu also addresses the psychology problem of mind, in that the super-beings are still tied to silly primate motivations, inherited by their precursor mind formats.  This is a very important area of thought as we approach the date where something close to consciousness is propogated by the (very real) AI arms race.  

That's just two aspects of exploration in the books, but there's so much there.

When I say fast, I mean fast. Like, there is no reasonable defense against an object heading towards you at near light speed. A crayola crayon (2 grams) at 99% the speed of light packs 2×10¹⁴ Joules of energy. 

One gram of TNT has about 4×10³ Joules of energy. So the equivalent amount of TNT when our crayon hits the earth is on the order of 8×10¹⁰ grams of TNT. 80 megatonnes. The largest nuke ever developed had 25 megatonnes (B41). 

Launching a crayola crayon wipes out major cities. Launching a 96 colour pack destroys the environment and instigated nuclear winter. Relativistic energy is no joke. God forbid you launch a few kilograms at a time - punch mountain sides holes in planets. A small asteroid cracks a planet in half. 

An incoming crayon at 0.99c is travelling at such high speeds that the light that it is pushing in front of it arrives only moments before it hits. There's no need for stealth. No radar system can detect something that small (it's cross section is smaller than radar wavelengths). You just die without warning.

The only defense is a satellite swarm which cuts off the entire view of the stars and lets no light in. This swarm needs to be several layers thick and moving erratically, or they just launch crayons in quick succession to punch through the holes. 

Basically, living on a planet gets you killed. There is no need to have infantry or tanks when your artillery wins the war in the first moment.

If someone who understands this better thinks I'm wrong then do correct me, but I *think* you'd have to move the Moon down to below geosynchronous orbit in order to have tidal drag actually lower the orbit rather than raise it. That way it's low enough that it moves overhead faster than the Earth below, so it's being constantly pulled back (and therefore lower) by the part of Earth it's passing over, rather than being dragged forward (and therefore outward) by it.

Geosynchronous orbit is a bit over 90% of the way down to Earth from Lunar orbit.

Tl;dr at the bottom. 
You basically have two scenarios, one like the Earth and the Moon where one body orbits the other, and one like, say, Earth and Mars, where they co-orbit a third body.
With the earth-moon scenario, it would just be difficult to have it be a very energetic collision. De-orbiting the moon would take a lot of energy, as it would require bringing it's orbital speed to ~0; this would require disgusting amounts of energy, and would really only result in the moon ""falling"" from orbit to collide with its planet. This would take longer than would perhaps be practical for a weapon. 
The Earth-Mars scenario **might** work better. You could deflect the outer planet into the path of the inner by strategic pulses of power to ellipticize the orbit so it crossed the inner orbit, and even if you missed the gravitational effects of the bodies passing one another would likely destabilize the orbit of the target body. Again, this would take preposterous amounts of energy. This would be a complicated procedure mathematically as well--one would have to calculate or hope that the bodies would end up in the same place at the same time, which could take many orbits (e.g. Years). This, too would be a very slow process, diminishing its effectiveness as a weapon. 
Collision with another planet-sized body is also overkill. A couple of large-ish asteroids moving at near-relativistic speeds and intercepting different areas of the planet's surface would be more than enough to destroy the entire surface of the planet, and would be much easier to guide, hide before impact, and destroy quickly. 

Tl;dr: It's probably physically **possible**, but would be incredibly difficult and not very effective as a weapon.",1569780302,{},f1w4ydn,False,t3_daqyps,False,True,t3_daqyps,/r/scifi/comments/daqyps/using_planets_as_weapons/f1w4ydn/,1569786195,1,True,[],False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,0,,,

Writing/dialogue is unconvincing, the marines don't sound or look the part. The cinematography is dull and clumsy, even by the standards of a low budget movie - so many scenes are unnecessarily wide just to get as much of the sets (which are not too bad) in as possible.

Such a beautiful movie with amazing performances. The movie does a fantastic job of introducing a weird concept of loving an AI and yet making it feel totally normal.

Its also fun to think about how our perception changes over time, is a fully independent, human-like AI being your main source of companionship bad?

Firstly, humanity was pretty much all wiped out due to a singularity of an AI. The AI isn't personally affected by this as its merely a means to an end. Mother killed off the planet because humans were already doing it to themselves. She is very specific in saying that she could have killed everyone, but she ""would be lonely"". Now, getting past the mass genocide in the film you are left with pretty much a blank slate. She is terraforming the planet for the future and wants humanity to inherit it. Where the water gets murky is whether or not shes doing this whole thing out of malevolence (ie, she JUST doesn't want to be lonely and this is all apart of her overall test for humanity). Or she is genuine, being that while she is still there she honestly wants humanity to ascend and be their best version.

Now, to that end. She has made up a batch of super humans and rebuilding everything from scratch. Its rather coy how the movie doesn't give daughter ANY expectations of how a society should look/be outside of putting others above yourself. 

PERSONALLY, my interpretation of the movie is mother indeed giving the reins over to daughter. She gives daughter a few reassurances and/or threats right before getting shot. Firstly, you cannot kill mother because she a singularity AI. Her two lines before ""dying"" were ""i will still be your mother"" and ""If you need to find me...."". Now first one is fairly harmless, maybe mother trying to say a genuine goodbye and that shes proud of her daughter. The second however.... is open to the implication that mother will wipe it and start again if she can't handle the task. Of course by the same token its also implied that she will be there for her daughter if she needs her. She proved shes willing to sacrifice and put other before herself so there is no reason to be hostile. But again, open to interpretation. 

Mother said it herself in the opening that she needed to learn how to be a good mother. Releasing APX01 into the wild to be raised by other humans other duress is pretty cruel. But there IS a point to it. She is learning how humans grow when they're surrounded by violence/hunger/survivalism and not being properly nurtured and raised. So, it may be easier to see APX01 as mother's example to daughter of ""this is how you're not supposed to be"". The woman said herself that if anyone in the mines were still alive you wouldn't wanna go there as there was no food and they'd have to resort to basically killing each other.

And it becomes then almost a horror sci-fi thriller as they're hunted by the disfigured Terminator that is using incredibly unorthodox tactics to not so much blend in, but hide in the darkness- but is also now much more vulnerable, all the while bring more dangerous because it's desperate. Instead of blending in like a cop, it just kills everything that sees it. But the disfigurement hasn't damaged its intelligence and it does some really super ingenious devious rube Goldberg type shit to try and ensnare and kill [insert target here.] That's a movie I'd watch. And instead of Arnold the actual Terminator, he's been uploaded into an AI system when his body gave outat some point and now is merely a voice via some device helping our protagonist escape the monster Terminator. Maybe our protagonist has to break in to some facility to steal Arnies ""consciousness"" first. Yes? Yes. I'd watch the shit out of that movie. And then maybe at the end the device is connected to some to some robotic industrial mech/robot and we get an Aliens (Alien 2) final battle scene between Arnie in some crazy contraption (maybe not even a contraption designed to fight such as a fork lift robot) vs this totally fucked up Terminator that we haven't seen fully until the final scene.

Netflix has the market share because they entered the market first. They have grown in a market without direct competition, often through licensing content they eventually lose as IP holders launch their own services. In the process, they failed to recognize who their real competition was. 

If you go back to the first few years, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has often said that their competition was cable and satellite subscriptions. Then he spent years talking about the need to [become HBO before HBO became Netflix](https://www.gq.com/story/netflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development). But today, it turns out that the strongest competition comes from streaming services that have the ability to _leverage_ their strengths into the field:

- Amazon is a behemoth of a company. They _host_ Netflix. They sell everything. They advertise themselves all over their website, one of the busiest in the world. They bundle free shipping and music and ebooks and all other kinds of crap with their video service. Prime Video could break entirely even, and Amazon wouldn't care because they don't need it. Amazon also grosses almost 15 times as much revenue as Netflix does. In a war of attrition, Amazon doesn't lose. 
- Apple and Google are similarly positioned to Amazon. In both cases, video streaming services also support their software/hardware ecosystems, meaning they may be willing to have streaming services that break even as long as they result in more revenue elsewhere. This is a simple example of cross-promotion, a form of business that Netflix is not currently positioned to do themselves.
- CBS sits on one of the largest IP catalogs on the planet. They date back almost a century, and have consistently generated content each and every year since. They also sit on market research and ratings analysis, which has existed in broadcast television's modern form since the late 1960s. CBS is merging with Viacom, which means CBS's catalog (which includes Showtime, the Smithsonian Channel, the CW, sports/news/international channels, as well as Simon &amp; Schuster publishing) will be combined with Viacom's (Nickelodeon, BET, CMT/MTV/VH1, Comedy Central, TVLand, Paramount Pictures, multiple news/sports/international channels, Bellator MMA/kickboxing, books and comic publishers).
- NBC would get a mention, except they belong to NBC Unviersal. Actually, that belongs to Comcast. Comcast owns NBC Universal, Telemundo, USA, SyFy, MSNBC, Universal theme parks, Sky Networks, Bravo, E!, Oxygen, Dreamworks, Fandango, Illumination, and through all of these dozens if not hundreds of foreign and domestic news/sports/entertainment networks.
- Aside from Amazon, all the rest of these pale in comparison to the streaming service(s) Disney offers. Not only Disney content, but Fox, ESPN, Disney music, publishing, and thousands of networks, stations, and properties. Disney is going to be a juggernaut, because they have consistently done one thing better than any other company on the planet - merchandising. Every division within the Disney company exists to support or be supported by merchandising. 

Assume for a moment that there is a good financially-driven motive for all of these companies to act the same way: to be going through huge mergers as they setup to kickoff their streaming services for real, to own amusement parks despite them having so little to do directly with mass media, or to collect media publishing capabilities. 

How does Netflix stack up? Well, the answer is that they offer [very little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix#Subsidiaries). They are exactly what they appear to be on the surface: a digital streaming company that makes some of their own content and licenses the rest. Their library is tiny, with only two shows longer than three seasons long. That will certainly change, but the lack of a competitive catalogue is one of the reasons they've taken on close to $25 billion in debt to produce content over the last several years. 

What Netflix has focused on the last few years is market expansion. They are available in pretty much every country with reliable internet. Which has worked to this point by ignoring competition and finding emerging markets where no competition exists... yet. But now, Netflix is going to reach global saturation, and their business model will need to shift from growing subscriptions into maintaining subscribers while getting as much profit as possible from each one. 


&gt;I went to a lecture at nextAI and they presented a map of the earth with countries colored red where they were the #1 streaming service. It was the entire earth minus North Korea and China.

&gt;The lecture was about their patented algorithms, and how incredibly powerful they are. They have the power to predict, generate, and verify that they are creating content which is fully adaptive and prevents churn.

I believe that's nothing but hype in the case of Netflix. While a ratings system like the Nielsen works by comparing competing broadcast events against one another, Netflix's AI is only able to look at how viewers use their own platform. It can't tell them if their viewers would prefer to see Disney movies or sports or news, because Netflix doesn't have any of those things to offer. AI has no way to determine whether or not Netflix is _competitive_ against other services. 

At the same time, Netflix's use of internal analysis has led to some questionable results. For example, they've found that more people will watch the first season of a new show than will watch a season 3 or season 4 of an existing show. People like new and shiny, which is great, but the end result is that anyone who's had Netflix for more than a few months can give you a list of canceled shows that pisses them off. If the highest ratings in TV history belong to the Superbowl, Netflix's AI has them producing nothing but Superbowls - but that's not really the TV we want to watch. 

All of these other streaming services are going to be run by companies that have a long history of being able to identify market and demographic trends, and then using it to develop popular and profitable content. It's driven by experience and internal policy shaped by the entire market, and no AI looking at a single platform is going to be competitive. 

&gt;In what respect? In my mind they are an institution, and people are jumping to copy them.

Streaming is being copied, because it's the future. Netflix has had a decade-long headstart, but they haven't found a way to secure themselves at the top. They are Myspace, Xerox, Kodak - a company with an edge that doesn't understand how to keep it. They have nothing unique to offer, other than getting there first. 

&gt;Actors are absolutely flocking to Netflix.

I would predict this is temporary, because it goes back to what I said above about knowing and developing content for the market. My example will be one George Lucas:

When George Lucas was first rolling into Star Wars, he was young, poor, and unproven. As a result, he didn't get special treatment, people told him no, the studios surrounded him with talent, and a tight budget resulted in one of the greatest film trilogies ever made. When George became obscenely successful, and leveraged it into merchandising, he peaked. He got special treatment, surrounded by yes men, and budgets as deep as his pockets - and he made the prequels. 

This is what Netflix is offering right now to try and steal talent. Tons of money and creative control to anyone who wants to jump to Netflix. But there will be two end results:

- Filmmakers without oversight aren't as good as their experience would suggest. Adam Sandler is a good example of this on Netflix.
- Filmmakers rarely want to make art that is easily digestible for mainstream viewing. Without executives demanding profitability and ratings, no artist ever makes a show as stupid as Big Bang Theory. But Netflix is in the film _business_, and shows like BBT are the ones that pay the bills. 

When Netflix gets in trouble now (like say if the stock market slumps), they only have two options: lower costs by making cheaper, more profitable shows (a direction they are entirely unprepared to move in), or raise prices. Raising prices will never be a good solution, because it means Netflix has no other way to make their platform profitable and signals that their collapse is inevitable.

Netflix should have secured a financial partner and bought FOX. They could have blocked Disney, while also shoring up all of the weaknesses with their organizational skillset and catalog.

*Battle of Britain (1969)*

Great movie with dogfighting (aerial warfare), guided by a beautiful orchestral score, starring Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier and Christopher Plummer among others.

*A bridge too Far (1977)*

As a Dutchman I've seen this one many times. It covers the (failed) Operation Market Garden to free all of The Netherlands. It stars again Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier and also Sean Connery, Ryan O'Neal and Gene Hackman.

My father ultimately always regretted passing an opportunity to be an extra, as ""he didn't want to lie on the street as a Kraut corpse for several hours""

*Patton (1970)*

This film follows the infamous general Patton. It won the Oscar's for Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Script and most rightfully so, Best Actor for George C. Scott playing the titular character.

*The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)*

In my opinion the film Alec Guinness should be remembered for.

*Fury (2014)*

The little tank that could. Not a classic by all means, but an excellent depiction of the raw and gritty reality of war. Tense and harsh. Great acting by Brad Pitt, Shia LeBoeuf, John Bernthal and Michael Peña.

&gt;You make a good point when you question why there aren't more original black characters but I doubt you got your panties in a bunch about why Disney chose to have the mermaids from a Danish fairy tale speak with American accents or why there was a crab with a Jamaican accent back in 1989. 

No I didn't because I was aged less than 4 years old. I don't think it would have been on me to be that woke.

&gt; your argument about merch makes zero sense. One film is a 30 year old animation, the other one is a live-action adaptation. To get them confused would way more about you than anyone else.

What? If you go to a Disney store or park, they have merch for every film they've made that I can think of other than Song of the South. So now are they just going to have 50% of Little Mermaid stuff have one Ariel and 50% have the other? And you say my point makes ""zero sense""? Because I personally think it's confusing and I'd be absolutely flabbergasted if I was the only one. You might not agree with my point, but do you honestly not see at all where I'm coming from there?

To me, the merch point is like if they changed Optimus Prime from a truck to a train. A kid might ask for an Optimus Prime toy and then get the wrong one.

(The first day of Capital Supremacy, it took a good 5 minutes to load the game then the match, and it crashed instantly, so I just uninstalled till just this week for the new co-op)    
The game's PvP rubs me the wrong way aswell, it just feels like a constant chaotic, poorly designed mess, getting blown up all over the place, walking into heroes, walking into dudes with card bonuses over you constantly...  That said, I much prefer a more structured and tuned PvE game mode anyway, so my PvP opinions should probably be taken with a grain of salt.

[],terminalblue,,,[],,,,text,t2_ehr3z,False,,"discovery is objectively  bad.  you are in denial if you are overlooking its massive flaws.

Lets make this clear, I kind of liked that first season.   it wasnt perfect but it showed potential.

Season 2 is an unmitigated clusterfucked of forced emotional moments, idiotic science, literally the worst dialogue I have ever heard in almost any media, and perhaps the worst and most non-sensical story arc I have ever seen in any story telling.

FOR EXAMPLE....once the AI was defeated there was non reason...no reason whatsoever in any way for them to travel into the future.   There was literally no reason at all for it.

The fact that the enterprise carried 100 or more shuttle craft in its secondary hull.   those things take upmore space then the volume of the entire ship.

Lets get this clear, they spent 2 seasons building up how special and important Michael is.  So when Ariam gets roughly 30 seconds to build character moments I simply do not care that she died, And spending SOOO MUCH of that episode dedicated to the death of a red shirt and thinking I am supposed to care because the music was dramatic is NOT how you respect a character.   And if you feel for the shit then I feel sorry for you.

SPEAKING OF THAT....there is literally no reason why that shit had to happen, they could have teleported ALL THREE OF THE THEM from the space station and back to discovery...just eliminating the problem and saving their lives.

When spock and micheal where in the section 13 ship and they had their fist/gun fight, there was literally no tension in the moment because spock had just happen to be off screen.  The hero of the show isn't going to get killed by the literal villain so spock being off screen just meant that he was going to save her ""in the nick of time"" .  oh and the concept of her phaser ""running out of ammo"" was kind of weird.   Not to say that phasers havent failed before in star trek....it just felt really stupid in a stupid moment.   Just another stupid cherry on the stupid cake.

Now for me the dumbest thing is kind of a nitpick, but in the moment where they are in the tiny spaceships and their ""spacediving"" or whatever to get to Jet's ship early in the season and the bridge crew acts lost and confused instead of like trained professionals, many of whom have been through battle multiple times already not to mention the fact that they have been through the FUCKING STAR FLEET ACADEMY AND THEY LITERALLY GET PSYCHOLOGICALLY ABUSED TO BECOME OFFICERS SO THEY DONT FUCK UP AND ACT LIKE CONFUSED CHILDREN.  they make the smallest error.   They start referring to distances in feet.   Now I am not saying that  they rent familiar with those terms, but the bridge crew of the Discovery is extremely diverse with aliens from everywhere.   you can say feet....that has no meaning to anyone.  there is a reason why people in the use dont measure their weight in ""stone"".  it's lazy stupid moment and should have been ADR'd to correct it.   But since season 2 of Discovery was exhausting to watch, no one fixed it.

Now thats just a list of things I can even remember.   I mean...I can even keep track of 90% of what happened because each episode was like a marathon and I was exhausted after watching each show.   Nothing I talked about above was a feeling.   those were all things that were factual, they happened.

Which was just moving away from SHIELD all together. Hell even Fury is more or less done with SHIELD (and didn't he say that at the end of The Winter Soldier? Also in FFH it seems that they are hinting at the forming of SWORD. SHIELD is pretty much dead) and they never bothered to try to connect the reforming with Tony Stark (it's like Tony Stark couldn't care less that an organization that his father help founded was coming back or something, in my opinion). Not only that but they then quickly destroyed SHIELD again at the end of Season 4 and made the main characters (again) running away from the military that was hunting them down as criminals (since technically they were or are since at least Fitz and Simmons both had a hand in trying to cover-up that fact that their friend, Dr. Radcliffe made the LMDs. Which then lead to the whole LMD takeover of SHIELD and the death of Jefferey Mace). 

If it was any other TV show maybe I could see myself either accepting that or just ignoring it. But since AoS has always been about, ""it's all connected"" and claims to be part of the MCU, for me, it HAS to make sense within the larger MCU. Like they couldn't even bother to mention that Ultron was the reason and instead with the Terminator jokes (well, okay Mace did bring up Ultron, once) and it was the show that made the claim that creating an AI was now illegal throught the Sokovia Accords but quickly forgotten about it throughout that season.

For me personally, even when they tried to do the Ghost Rider/Darkhold stuff it felt disconnected because these characters are not supernatural/magical/another worldly base. TIn my opinion, there was absolutely no reason to do anything related to the supernatural and they even, in the previous season, made a supernatural base comic book character into a more scientific base (aka an Inhuman) character. 

As with the whole idea that Hydra HAD to be behind everything felt like it was a very small universe, in my opinion (they even tried to tie them to the Watchdogs in Season 3). Sure they supposedly ""destroyed"" Hydra in late Season 3 but then they brought them back in late Season 4 because ""the Framework"" and the villains that they wrote later were just, in my opinion, lame. 

&gt;While I still enjoyed S5 and S6, I could’ve gone without going the space and time-traveling plots. Feels very disconnected from the original idea

Yeah, it was surely a very disconnected thing when they had these characters interact with supernatural characters/books, time travel, prophecies, etc...

[],ayitsjonas,,,[],,,,text,t2_26v8ob6m,False,,"Objective points of review:  


Acting: aside from the main character whose acting isn't so bad, the rest of the acting was terrible in most of the scenes. Emotions are all over the place and conversations have no logical point to follow. People react disproportionately to everything by yelling or getting angry for no tangible reason. ""Hey I know I almost murdered the whole crew and the captain saved our asses, but I'mma still threathen her with a enough only a few minutes after I almost crashed our ship into a star."" Sure, seems perfectly logical to send a fucking psychopath in space, when any real psycho evaluation would have sent him to a psych-ward  


Plot: the whole crew was a bunch of teenagers with little to no experience on how to work on a spaceship. They all act like spoiled kids and don't seem to be able to follow basic safety regulations, which leads into more complications and deaths that were needed for the plot I guess (but COMPLETELY avoidable were the crew not utter morons), since there wouldn't be anything happening if it wasn't from the stupidity of the crewmembers   
(i.e Michelle who keeps yelling and swearing for no fucking reason. She's supposed to be a top space engineer yet acts like a high school drama queen, or the Biologist who conveniently doesn't know about boron so they unfreeze a guy that then kills himself after he finds the source; bring a new character, character does what he's supposed to, then we delete that character: that is awful writing 101. If you every took a scenography class, you'd know that, but who cares about studies when you can just call everyone stupid on the Internet, amirite?). The ship's AI that cries and doesn't know what to do most of the time was so boring and tedious it makes Jar Jar Binks look like an interesting character.

It's like they're looking for a reason to fuck shit up else they wouldn't be able to advance the plot. Everything was put together abruptly without any corellation between events or logical followings. Very, very poor writing.  


Camera work: Reaction shots. People yelling. Reaction shots. People having sex. Something bad happens. People yelling again. Reaction shots. More sex. CGI was god-awful, and the shots of the ship quarters were repetitive, bland and boring. The scenes on Earth were AWFUL, long and boring. Selma Blair's character seemed to be from another series and didn't fit at all with the rest of the plot.  


It's a soap opera set in space, that's it. And a bad one at that. If you like 50% of the episodes being teenage drama between what are supposed to be qualified experts, then that's on you. But pretty much everything about this show was awful. Your review isn't unbiased because you just decided you liked it. It simply shows you have no point of reference to compare it to, and you don't know enough about moviemaking to form a real objective opinion on the matter. So your review is entirely subjective. It's cool that you liked the show dude, but that doesn't make it an objectively good show. It was bad. Everything about it was bad. Writing is lousy, plot doesn't make any sense, nothing feels like it's genuine. It's OBJECTIVELY a terrible show from all angles and perspectives.

**spoilers on an old show up ahead!**

Final episode had John and Sarah Connor finally meet Catherine Weaver, a T-1001 who has been posing as the CEO of a giant corp named Catherine Weaver. As Catherine Weaver, the T-1001 had been creating an AI named John Henry using a stolen prototype of Skynet and the body/processors of a salvaged Terminator. John and Sarah go to confront her thinking she’s some human creating Skynet when a flying Terminator drone attacks them and Catherine Weaver protects them in her liquid Terminator form. After that, Catherine Weaver says she wasn’t building Skynet but rather something to fight it and that she knows John’s Terminator is around her basement where John Henry is. 

Meanwhile in the basement of the company, John’s Terminator, a T-900 with the appearance of a young woman called Cameron, finds John Henry. She acknowledges she knows him from before and the scene cuts away.

When John, Sarah, and Catherine reach them they find a deactivated Cameron by herself. Catherine realizes John Henry used her chip to travel to the future and starts activating her time machine to get him back. John goes with her to find Cameron (during the show she had been acting more human and they both have a thing going on). Sarah refuses to go and stays behind promising to take care of Skynet herself. 

John and Catherine arrive to the future. She disappears and leaves John alone, who finds a coat to cover himself. He’s then found by a group of humans, including Derek Reese, John’s uncle who had been sent to the past and had been part of his group. Derek doesn’t recognize him and asks him his name. John tells him he’s John Connor and Derek says he’s never heard that name ever before (implying John isn’t the leader in the future) and that he has his brother’s coat on. Then in comes Kyle Reese and Cameron, until John realizes it’s a human girl and not the Cameron he knows. 

There’s a lot more to this ending but it’s pretty big cliffhanger. Even thought I told you the ending its worth a watch for Lena Headey as Sarah and how the show expands on the franchise mythos.

For me, today - a Netflix Original is mostly a direct to tv quality project. A prime original on the other hand, is more likely to be watchable. Don't get me wrong, there are good to great Netflix shows out there, and some bad Prime shows too... But pound for pound Prime wins out.

[],danhakimi,,TheWire1,[],,,dark,text,t2_4d0ul,False,,"&gt;First, are you comparing Google's public, free products to a proprietary product?

Google's ""public, free products"" are mostly proprietary, and, despite being miles ahead of Netflix's recommendation AI, still aren't good.

&gt;Second, yes I use them. The image recognition is pretty good, the news recommendation is on point, maps is frighteningly good, and Youtube is crap. But of course that's just my personal experience, yours is probably different.

From an AI-related perspective, I agree with one of these.

&gt;And a person is unique, but people are not. Categorization works,

Wrong. Categorization is an *okay* heuristic for *some* purposes, but by and large, it's a lot shittier than people think.

&gt;there's no need of ML to know that. Ads have been relying on categorization (demo) for years, politic messaging rely on categorization. You may be unique, but there are many like you.

Categorization is marginally better than one-size-fits-all advertising. That doesn't mean it can accurately predict subscribing habits in the way you described. It just means that it *isn't completely useless*.

&gt;All of the elements you're referring to, viewing actions, release dates, actors, budgets, how many episodes in the season, the length of the episodes, are there a major event in real life at the sale time of a release, and many others, are just variables. Variables that can be computed, if not on their own, then aggregated with other variables.

I didn't refer to the length of the episodes or budgets or episode counts. The elements I referred to were mostly not quantifiable.

Although, now that you mention it, perhaps a show goes poorly, but the showrunner says ""hey, we're sci-fi, give us a real budget and let us soar."" Or a show goes well, but not well enough to justify its budget, and the showrunner suggests a much lower budget for the second season.

Or a show loses a star and your algorithm can't tell whether that star was a net value for the price because your algorithm only has one show's data as a data point on that actor, and there are obviously too many other factors involved in that show. ML needs a lot of data, and if you're just measuring demographics and shows watched, you're going to be really limited in the amount of data you actually have available to you. Now, you'll probably have other data supplementing your data, like how hot an actor is on google, or instagram, or what have you, but you sure as fuck don't have the oracle you're pretending you have, especially for new actors.

Or your show loses a shitty actor who was a decent fit for the role or integral to the plot. Last I checked, ML still can't tell which characters are integral to the plot, or shit like that -- that's a creative task, now isn't it?

And at the end of the day, a lot of ML results are kind of black box answers -- it's hard, if possible, to track the inner workings of ML algorithms. So if there's a factor you think it might have weighted incorrectly, tough shit, you'll never know.",1565110079,{},ew4gf1m,False,t3_cmda2p,False,True,t1_ew4dymt,/r/television/comments/cmda2p/the_oa_canceled_after_two_seasons_at_netflix/ew4gf1m/,1565110082,1,True,,False,television,t5_2qh6e,0,,,

&gt;Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computer systems, as opposed to the hardware side that computer engineers mainly focus on (although there is overlap). Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas (such as algorithm and data structure development and design, software engineering, information theory, database theory, computational complexity theory, numerical analysis, programming language theory, computer graphics, and computer vision), their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman  
&gt;While working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under Gerry Sussman, Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI truth maintenance system, called dependency-directed backtracking. This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems. As of 2009, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking. The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.

Knowing that theoretically you could explore the whole galaxy using current technology (insufficient funds however) with [self replicating probes/seed factories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft) in half a million years at speeds of only 0.1c. If only 1 civilization in our galaxy managed to not destroy itself and decided to send out probes, i think its highly likely were at least on their radar and it doesnt seem that farfetched to have some probes flying around to observe and collect data (like we observe and collect data of less advanced species here on earth). Basically all our resources would be available elsewhere in the galaxy except our biosphere and genepool. So if you accept the previous as possible, even more outrageous stuff like abduction stories enter the realm of possibility imo.",1568849769,{},f0pxguo,False,t3_d60w7b,False,True,t1_f0ptthq,/r/news/comments/d60w7b/navy_confirms_ufo_videos_posted_by_blink_182/f0pxguo/,1568849770,1,True,[],False,news,t5_2qh3l,0,,,

- The fact people don't disregard pop culture from more than 10 years ago.

People in the '60s would've thought it bogus that people of the future would live on space stations and listen to the Beatles, but that's what happens on the ISS today

- The fact multiple technologies will converge and enhance each other. For sci-fi stories that are closer to parables and reflections on modern society, I can understand it, but there are plenty serious attempts at showing a future society that will completely miss a trend that's obvious even today. I.e. progression of automation, but no transhumanism (biological or bionic); transhumanism but no automation (*Deus Ex* of all franchises is actually guilty of this and has never explained it AFAIK); GATTACA-styled enhanced humans with rigid bio-hierarchies between workers and owners, but no automation rendering a worker race obsolete even when robots &amp; human-level AI clearly exist; casual space colonization complete with human pioneers risking their lives creating colonies on other planets despite it being easier, cheaper, safer, and more practical to remotely build colonies ahead of time; people using advanced technology either for their intended purposes, for nefarious purposes, or accidentally screwing it up in an easily fixed way— never using sci-fi tech to play jokes or troll others or being so incompetent that an entire planet stops functioning for a few hours; etc. etc.

- The fact people don't gush over the fact it's The Future™. You can't go a single day without people marveling over things you have to actually *stretch* to point out how sci-fi our life is (e.g. smartphones, AI that can beat humans at age-old games, driverless cars, CRISPR, commercial space companies, and so on, some of which have little effect on your daily life), but in works set centuries in the future in blatantly sci-fi worlds, people just stoically accept that the times are different.

It's more than depressing, it's actively dangerous/stupid. Even if there are bad outcomes from climate changes the benefit accrued over the past 100 years from using inexpensive, readily available energy from hydrocarbon fuels are so huge that costs associated with climate changes will be worth it. 
   
I'm old enough to remember only black and white TVs, air conditioning pretty rare. Clothing, even low quality was expensive as were shoes. Options for food were a fraction of what they are now. Entertainment, very few options. 
     
If you got most forms of cancer you were dead, period. People dressed up for air travel because it was ridiculously expensive. Going out to dinner was rare, no internet, no video games beyond very expensive home pong consoles- that's all they could play, pong. 
    
Yes, a lot of this isn't life or death, but many of these things offer a much richer life. And again, the internet and all the other information technologies have have impacted every facet of life from entertainment, to business (no more secretary pools), to medical sciences, to social connections, to deep learning systems (hopefully weak AI soon). 
  
This future is pretty amazing from the perspective of someone my age, I'm 50. 
   
Oh, back when I was 12 (1981) I won a local newspaper award for a poster I designed and created which essentially had the same message this young girl is spouting. Had decrepit, unused oil rigs with a large sun in the background, said something like solar is the future. I was reading a lot of Science fiction back then. 
   
Shorter point: inexpensive, ubiquitous energy is what humanity needs. Costs due to pollution and possible climate effects are worth all of the lives that will be saved and living standards radically raised.
   
I'd prefer no hydrocarbon energy production, all nuclear and solar would be great. But there is a path there which makes everyone a beggar, and many which will make everyone rich, comparatively. Focusing on making everyone a beggar, keeping the wretchedly poor, poor is unethical, grotesque. 
    
I remember when I started reading about nuclear energy soon after three mile island hysteria- early teens. Even then I was furious that environmentalists were doing everything in their power to stop nuclear energy. My guess is Thunberg hasn't read a fraction of my list in science periodicals, science fiction, non-fiction science books at 16 then I had at 12/13. And this person is needs someone to tell her to slow down. I think at her age she could have developed an deeper and rational understanding of the issues she emotes about. But again, my guess is she doesn't even understand the different types of radiation, measures of total possible output vs actual available output per time period concerning renewable energy. Most importantly how horribly poor huge amounts of humanity are due to intermittent or nonexistent energy. 
   
Any, sorry for the semi-rant. 
    
I don't take advice nor give much thought to people who haven't fixed an appliance, changed oil in a car, remodeled a house, etc. Those are things I had done by the time I was her age. Now apply to energy industries, those types of tasks times a million plus they're much more complex tasks, every day, 365, to keep the lights on and the food cold.

The OII currently has the following research clusters reflecting the diverse expertise of faculty: 

&gt;The faculty and students of the OII have made many advances to the study of technology and society. Director Helen Margetts' book Political Turbulence was the first book-length manuscript on the impact of social media on public life. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger's book Big Data was the first to define and explain the importance of big data in contemporary economics, culture, and politics. His 2018 work Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data focuses on the role of platforms for allocating demand and supply beyond the price mechanism. Professor Philip N. Howard was the first political scientist to define and study astroturfing and has been responsible for significant research on fake news, bots and trolls in international affairs. Luciano Floridi is the world's leading ethicist on AI and big data.

[],volibeer,,,[],,,,text,t2_e894z,False,[],"I got a few points, but mainly i am wondering why you are eye-pointing so much on late abortion.  To my understanding, the law decriminalized abortion, meaning that the state before was ""no abortion allowed"" and now is ""some regulated form of abortion is allowed"". Actually they even define the 22-week line, and give an argumentation for why this line was drawn there. It is a common line that is drawn for abortion at that is the point in time when the child has the slightest of a chance of surviving outside of the womb. After 22 weeks you need sever circumstances to convince 2 doctors, and even this runs out at a given state of the pregnancy. You can check  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion\_in\_Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Australia) , as it just got updated, but take it with a grain of salt as it only wiki. So where would you cross the line between late abortion and  acceptable abortion?

I think setting a well regulated and science driven frame that allows abortion is much better than allowing a emotionally/religiously driven regime of banning abortion at all. 

Also I can not quite understand  argument of biasedness you are bringing up.

&gt; And this sounds dark, but I don't think a person undergoing an unwanted pregnancy would be able to come to an unbiased conclusion. 

So you think any person that is in danger on the streets or wherever does a unbiased assessment of what form of defense is right?  Is a soldier that is in war assessing situations unbiased? Is any human assessing anything that has an emotional effect on it ever unbiased? I do not even understand why this human bias is something bad, I myself would for example much rather by judged in a court run by humans that by AI.

I think we can both agree on abortion not being ok at a certain point of human development, yet when that point is is the difficult question that it is easy to disagree on.

Globalism is, I guess, the idea that issues should be solved on a planetary level, if necessary. I fail to see the issue with that. We are one species.

I guess Trump does not like ""globalism"", because any country would be responsible for the BS it pulls which impacts others. which leads to...

Nationalism. I guess there is a misunderstanding on the terms here. Trump says nationalism, but what he really means is jingoism. The exaltation of any country, without much cause or against any reason. Any country can be great (with a few exceptions, some of which Trump actually loves... North Korea, Saudi Arabia...). There are good elements in pretty much every country, they just differ from place to place.

&gt; A robot is now delivering sermons in Japan: the beginning of AI and religion? Screen Shot.

&gt; When talking about the possibility of AI being implemented in religion, Mayor poses the questions that everyone should be asking themselves: &amp;quot;How can one trust that the machine learning and algorithms would always be beneficial to the users and not to the makers and deployers of robot priests? Could AI distinguish between immoral acts and moral values? Could AI discern motives and intentions and recognise sincere remorse, experience empathy, or truly embody the human qualities of mercy and forgiveness?&amp;quot; The doubts and uncertainty that surround this technology explain why people feel uncomfortable about the prospect.

Honestly these are more so dilemmas I have but I cant really answer, i'm by no means aiming this at anything you said just voicing some concerns.... What laws must Facebook abide by on their platform? Can we trust that a company could police itself without any oversight of said decisions, especially when it means potentially silencing someones legitimate voice? Now i'm not saying that this page was in bad faith or not(to be fair, I didn't read into it at all), I'm more so concerned with the precedent an increase of things like this happening is setting. As our online platforms get larger and more people are funneled onto them(FB, Google, Ect) as opposed to other sites, at what point is it too much ""control"" or potential for corruption?  As it stands, you have no ""bill of rights"" on the internet. Pretty sure these social media sites also have a clause within the law that prevents them from being sued over these types of decisions(I'll look for source after this post and edit if I locate it). I personally work at ISP NOC and I myself am concerned with where everything is headed. All of this is based around the idea that people are too stupid to realize whats true and whats not true so the solution is to have big corps manage it for us? Ultimately, i'd imagine that it will just dumb people down even more. There are 2.7 billion people on facebook. How can a company of 40k people realistically police it? Every person in the company would have to check 47 pages every minute for the entire day and thats not even counting fan/product/meme pages. Is AI the solution? If so what material do you ""teach/train"" the AI with and who decides what that material is? How about we start pushing a culture of sourced material again that can be traced instead of an image of Neil deGrasse Tyson or Gretta with some dumb out of context quote along the top. Meme culture is whats pushing a majority of this crap on both sides....and although I love my memes, quite frankly i'm sick of it. Most just need to learn how and where to research for themselves, too many people(myself included at times) take headlines as gospel. If journalists cited more stories and pointed their viewers toward resources and how to find stuff, more people would start to think for themselves and would be less likely to question it(I certainly would). All these conspiracy videos existed in the 90's as well and were everywhere in the early days of the internet, yet it didn't sway me one way or the other. I pretty much just disregarded it and it seems like a lot of others did too. What changed since then? IMO i'd say it was the polarizing of said topics across multiple platforms but that's just my opinion.

[],GraveyardPoesy,,,[],,,,text,t2_3qubo,False,,"&gt;The Chinese government hovers around  an 80% approval rating

&amp;#x200B;

According to the Chinese government itself, which is known to manipulate statistics, in an environment of censorship and coerced patriotism. It is also hard to tell whether people are as happy with the CCP's authoritarianism, censorship etc. as they are with its overall governance. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that in an environment of censorship people are denied the right to imagine or realise fruitful alternatives. That deprivation is real but underrepresented in your statistic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;850 million people have been lifted out of poverty in  China. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the CCPs main accomplishment but most people frame this is as some kind of miracle of CCP economic engineering. In truth, China is a country of over a billion people with low labour costs. 850 million people might have been lifted out of poverty but that could only have ever been possible with significant foreign investment, which the CCP has often gamed (i.e. not living up to its WTO promises, forcing technology transfers etc.). Any half-competent government could have been in power, authoritarian or otherwise, and this statistic would have still been realised or neared, so it is no justification of an Orwellian regime.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The PRC is well liked within China and improves the lives of the  citizens so why would it collapsing, creating political chaos and  possibly a civil war that could kill thousands be a good thing?

&amp;#x200B;

You may not have noticed this but the CCP has disappeared / killed thousands of people, its stifles the press, it has no regard for human rights or the rule of law (as evidenced by the treatment of human rights lawyers / campaigners), it does not tolerate political opposition and it persecutes artists (Liu Xiaboa, Ai Weiwei). It is also starting to project its hollowed out vision of human life - without intellectual, social, artistic, political or religious freedom (Xinjiang) - outwards, as demonstrated by its foreign policy (reducing trade with Norway for years when Liu Xiaboa was granted the nobel peace prize, suspending police cooperation with France when it gave asylum to the wife of the illegally detained head of interpol, and we all know about Canada etc.): 

[https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-have-been-killed-by-the-Chinese-Communist-Party-since-the-party-came-to-power-in-China](https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-have-been-killed-by-the-Chinese-Communist-Party-since-the-party-came-to-power-in-China)

That's also not to mention its policy towards Tibet, Tailand, the South China Sea, or its deliberate propping up of the North Korean regime (which also accounts for thousands of deaths and the deprivation of millions), or its support for authoritarian regimes around the world. In other words, the CCP is currently a negative force in the world, rather than encouraging or exporting freedom, rights, legal protections or democracy around the world it is all too happy to export surveillance, authoritarianism and the deprivations that can come with these. Seeing the political collapse of one corrupt party is far preferable to seeing the growth of a superpower that is committed to being a net exporter of deprivation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;China's  foreign initiatives like the Belt and Road is the furthest thing from  exploitation, its a win win situation where China supplies investment  with a low interest rate to help develop the infrastructure of poorer  countries in the global south. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time will tell whether the Belt and Road is a mutually benefitial arrangement or a cynical way to exploit the debt of other countries for political gains. I would be very surprised if the country that reduced trade with Norway due to an independent body giving a Chinese thinker a Nobel Peace Prize wouldn't also seek to leverage newly constructed trade ties that it could turn up or down like a tap.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On the  issue of climate change, China is years ahead of its goals for reducing  carbon emissions. The USA denies climate change even exits and it's  military is the leading polluter on the planet.

&amp;#x200B;

This is one thing we can all be happy about, but it is a double-edged sword since the CCP is committed to huge, unenvironmental infrastructure developments (ghost cities) at the same time that it is committed to being improving envrionmental standards, and this is simply not feesible:

[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/17/is-time-to-end-our-fixation-with-gdp-and-growth](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/17/is-time-to-end-our-fixation-with-gdp-and-growth) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How  is China militaristic when the United states is the nation with  military bases all across the globe, has a history of causing coups,  criminal invasions, numerous war crimes, and is the first and only  nation to use nuclear weapons (on civilians no less). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not American and I'm not defending America (we all know that America's recent history is troublesome. Militaristic might have been the wrong word, expansionist might have been better (as seen in China's treatment of Tibet, Taiwan, the South China Sea and its absurd claim to be an arctic nation).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What  are the consequences of American hegemony?  If we survive climate  extinction,   a dark future of endless exploitation and oppression  
&gt;  
&gt;Chinese hegemony? a bright future where humanity is finally put before profits

&amp;#x200B;

That last part is laughable. There was a time when I welcomed Chinese ascendancy, when the CCP talked about peace, cooperation and mutual respect on the world stage. There is little evidence of these things today (I already mentioned about France, Canada and Norway), the CCP that we have come to know is instead determined to steal technology from its partners, dump steel and other commodities to destroy their markets and prefers to financially support authoritarian regimes around the world rather than open up its own economy to the democracies that invested in and enriched it. China's outright refusal to live up to its WTO commitments to the rest of the world, it's technology theft and its insistence that Chinese workers be exclusively employed on African infrastructure projects shows that the PRC are out to exploit their partners, not to share the profits of global development.",1569313140,{},f1axtzm,False,t3_d7rhwv,False,True,t1_f190732,/r/worldnews/comments/d7rhwv/chinese_journalists_will_soon_be_tested_on_their/f1axtzm/,1569313141,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0,,,

&gt; The launch of Huawei&amp;#039;s latest smartphone, the Mate 30, has been hampered by the ongoing trade war between China and the US, which has resulted in Google pulling its apps and services from the company&amp;#039;s new devices.

&gt; Huawei expects the US ban to cost it &amp;pound;8bn. &amp;quot;It is very hard to see how Huawei can become the world&amp;#039;s biggest mobile phone maker at present given it is banned in the US market and it has suffered serious reputational damage as a result of being added to the US &amp;#039;entity list&amp;#039;,&amp;quot; said Wood.

Apple would put some chips of own design into their devices all the way from the iPhone 4. Those weren't yet CPUs or GPUs but it was back then that they already started putting custom silicon into their devices

If you're interested in the subject [check out this new article from Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-a13-bionic-chip-iphone/) that talks both about the new A13 and about Apple's history in silicon design

Designing own chips is essential as it provides a key advantage over competitors. Fingerprint readers, IR scanners, photo enhancement, AI, encryption, screen control, and others can all be improved if one has own chips

Apple has its own chip design team with hundreds of employees

I'll try to dig them up. I'm in the midst of trying to get better organized, so maybe now's the time to better organize all my random bookmarks lol

&gt;One other thing I’m not sure I understand is the extent to which machines are capable of developing theses or underlying fundamental understandings that humans have yet to develop or even ponder.

Its weird, and even as a programmer who's kinda watched the tech emerge and kind of understand... I still really don't. But IMO the scariest part of the modern age is that even as someone who doesn't understand, you can still get incredibly powerful models out of the open source tech that exists. 

The TL;DR is that different problems can be categorized by the type of problem they're aiming to solve. Maybe its a classification problem where you want to group things around known labels, or a clustering problem where you want to group things based on key indicators but don't yet know what the labels are. Or maybe its some kind of regression modelling that tries to look at past results and plot some kind of linear curve that describes them which could then be used to project future results given whatever variables. While each model could likely individually be generated by humans, machine learning rapidly increases the rate at which you can develop those models, and expands the reach of the technology. Think how much more accessible product development is with 3D printers, vs the oldschool way where you have to research &amp; find manufacturers and pay out the nose for each iteration... except the feedback loops are faster and ultimately more far reaching. 

&gt;To date, I’ve heard of machine learning and AI that produce astounding results within the general parameters and assumed conclusions given to them by human beings, but nothing truly and/or independently “out of the box,” so to speak.

I think this depends on what your definition of out of the box entails. Personally, I'm still amazed constantly by what technology can do now that it couldn't 10 years ago. Models being overfitted is definitely a big concern, but its gotten better, and is ultimately at the control of the team developing the models so its not really a computer limitation. 90+% of the work now with ML development is in compiling, cleaning and preparing the data for training. If you want to see a truly mind boggling piece of tech that will open your synapses, check out [Amazone Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). Amazon had all their AWS tech already which included various sets of ML tooling, and realizes most of the work was in the preparing, categorizing and cleaning of data stage, so they released SageMaker which uses ML to prepare your data for training your ML... I shit you not. All of this future tech sounding stuff is now becoming so turnkey its almost approaching being LEGO. 

&gt;Are you saying we’re right on the cusp of those “outside the box” sort of insights? I assume you are. And if so, how exactly does that translate to AI figuring out how to interface with our biological makeup, namely our brain matter and nervous system in general?

Yes. Not necessarily just because of quantum computers, but just in general 100x yes. Technology is an exponential curve, and we're living through the heel of it where we're just now starting to realize how fast things have changed over the past 100-200 years. The next 100 years will be truly insane, and the next 10 years will be transformative, while the next 3 (Canada's election, the US election, and Germany's election in 2021) will be critical IMO. 

Re: how ML helps with BCI, modern neuroscience is being propelled by machine learning enabling it to make sense of the uncountable number of circuits in the brain. The older school brain breakdown of all the gyruses is increasingly dated while we've managed to map specific circuits in higher res, and some teams have applied machine learning to the data resulting from increasingly high res scans of the brain. The entire field is admittedly incredibly crude compared to most other modern sciences. The best description I've heard is that our understanding of the brain is at around our understanding of medicine when we still practiced medicinal cannibalism lol. But the missing ingredient is ultimately computational engines capable of computing faster than our meat computers, which despite being remarkably stupid, are also orders of magnitude more efficient computers per energy cost than any device you've ever touched, and given our exponential tech curve and ML in general being at the precipice of controlling everything, IMO neuroscience is going to see staggering developments over the next 20-30 years that will easily enable an implant driven cyber borg.",1569128370,{},f11okki,False,t3_d7ego2,False,True,t1_f11jx2n,/r/worldnews/comments/d7ego2/microsoft_chief_brad_smith_says_rise_of_killer/f11okki/,1569130813,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0,,,

The idea that we’re just going to magically and seamlessly interface between the engineered world of machines/computers/AI and the *human brain* is far more difficult than people imagine.

It’s not just about merging or commingling hardware. It’s not just about merging or commingling software. It’s taking two things that operate in two completely different modalities, aside from some form of electrical impulse, and blending them together. And then it’s not just blending them together, but blending them in a way that results in the destruction of neither, etc.

I know science fiction works have made that seem like it’s right around the corner, but it’s not. It’s kinda like how people in the 60s thought we’d have flying cars and be living on other planets by Y2K.

There's a discussion to be had about efficiency, waste and filters, clearly but the way to incentivise it is carbon tax, and the biggest part of it would be their current consumption, they should be mandated to use the same green mix as the general population (in Germany industry pays less taxes on electricity and they are allowed to use electity from coal exclusively, while the general population is mandated to use a minimum from solar and wind and are taxed more for it.",1569796811,{},f1xd8r1,False,t3_daufdt,False,True,t1_f1vj0uh,/r/worldnews/comments/daufdt/thousands_of_ships_fitted_with_cheat_devices_to/f1xd8r1/,1569806844,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0,,,

Back before the 1980s, before the EPA declared CO2 a pollutant, pollution from ICEs was mainly soot, unburned hydrocarbons, SOx, NOx, and heavy metals.

SOx combines with water to make sulfuric acid, so we had a lot of problems with acid rain back then. It increases the pH of soils, so it was killing forests and grasslands, and it also dissolves calcium carbonate, so there were a lot of building facades, statues, and ancient ruins that were melting in the rain.

SOx also causes opaque aerosols in the air, so there was a little bit of global dimming, which is the reason for the cooler times between 1940 and 1980. In the 1970s, there was legislation all over the world to limit SOx because of acid rain, and then in 1985 most European countries adopted the Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions, and long story short, nations have laws against sulfur emissions now, and that's part of why global temperature started rising again after 1980, because the SOx aerosols went missing.

Globally, transportation is responsible for around 25-30% of CO2 emissions, and shipping is responsible for about 10% of that, or about 2.5-3% of global CO2 emissions.

However, it's also true that shipping produces more _pollution_ than cars, because cars are fairly clean, they mainly emit CO2 and water. Shipping is dirty, it emits CO2 and water, and all that other junk.

CHAPTER 10
The Stronger Rules: Might Is Right
“The good press—the one called ‘left press’—already stands and declares 
about the crimes of fascism”, Abba Aḥime’ir wrote in Ha-‘Aretz during the 
short period in which he published his articles there, “and after the public is 
fed up with the issue of Mateotti—this Fascist toothpick which prevents many 
socialists and other vegetarians from seeing the Bolshevist log—they began 
signalling together an alarm about the issue of Southern Tyrol”. But Aḥime’ir 
had no intention to dwell on that subordinate issue. “What is good and moral 
and gentleman-like in relations between human beings”, he argued,
is harmful and useless in the relations between one human society to another. 
And if the leader of a certain human society would take its private relations 
as a measure for its relations as a representative of his society, it will be haz-
ardous for his society. Miserable are the passengers of ship whose Captain 
navigates it according to the Kantian absolute imperative!

A company may need some administrative oversight but with the progression of AI, you will see offices with 5 administrators go down to 1 or get rid of those 5 and divy up the few tasks that require a human to other parts of the office who’s jobs have also had a decrease in demand. Where as today an administrator may facilitate training, AI software will facilitate training. Where today administrator may take inventory of office supplies, a PO will automatically be submitted when Inventory needs replenished. So please elaborate. 

&gt; Codetermination giving workers the right to vote against such a policy and a matching exit tax on jobs and capital. Other forms of capital controls. We have to accept some capital flight, of course, because that's unavoidable, but if the frog is boiled properly, it isn't too much. That's why Warren's plans have to be viewed as a package.

That is so impractical it’s not even funny. Companies are bought and sold every day, no one at any company wants to lose their job but that often happens during a merger. You aren’t going to change that because that is often why people start companies, to sell them. You also would decrease the incentive for migration to the US for entrepreneurs. 

 Before I continue I just want to say- the crucial difference is you trust the government is better equipped to make decisions with money than you or me. I believe in closing tax loop holes, I believe Amazon should be paying taxes. However, the amount of waste and cost that goes in to social programs like SNAP or SSD is silly and less effective than just supplying people with a dividend. I want the money given to the people to decide what they do with it. You want the government to decide that for you. Warren is not positioning the country to handle massive job loss with automation. What is her solution for the 3.5 million truck drivers who will be out of work? Or the average retail worker? Or UPS truck loader? What are her solutions as this takes place over the next 5-10 years? 


&gt; I'm talking like if they leave it is still better for us than if they stay. Because these people are bad for all of us, and while I'd rather strip them of most of their unearned wealth before they can leave, I'm happy to simply strip them of some of that wealth and ensure that they never have any impact on US politics again.


Really? Unearned wealth? So Jeff Bezos didn’t put any work in to building Amazon? Elon Musk didn’t shower at the Y while working 80 hours a week on PayPal? I presume you’re typing this on a phone or laptop, how do you think you got this technology? Your view is so short-sided. You blame the entrepreneur when you should blame the legislators. Without Prosperity comes poverty, crime, lower education, less voting, higher disease, etc and you think eliminating the successful business owner will solve your problems. Who hires the employees to pay the taxes then? Less jobs/companies means less revenue, less revenue means less social programs.


&gt; Honey, I want to destroy the capital class. I'm not here to take from the rich and give to the poor, I'm here to take control of the institutions that the rich use to exploit all of us. Socialism is about power, not wealth, except insofar as concentrated wealth impacts power.


By institutions do you mean government or private sector workplaces? If you want to take control of government then just say you want to get corporate money out of politics- still isn’t socialist. How are you being exploited? If a business owner, who took the risk and started a business didn’t make more money than you, the guy putting tape on boxes, then there would be no incentive to innovate and develop anything. If the  engineer didn’t make more money than the janitor, why the fuck get an education? The long term effect of this is little to no development, lower production, lower wages and thus less tax revenue. Instead of just claiming you want a better tax system you are claiming you want to rid the country of its most successful people. They are paying the lowest taxes legally allowed by our tax code, it’s our own fault that we allow it. Instead of wanting to change faulty aspects of our legislation, you want to overthrow the capitalist class like it’s 1920s Soviet Union. You’re ignorant and you provide no actual solutions, just talking points from Marx’s manifesto, which was written at a time before industrialization, and long before human capital was becoming less and less necessary to produce goods/services, let’s alone  design and create goods/solutions.  


&gt; This accomplishes none of my goals. At best, it is simply no change at all. At worst, it empowers the capital class further by creating a class of failsons who have lost even the power of collective bargaining and now live at the mercy of the politics of the wealthy.


No change at all? Riigghhhtt, because no one cares about their ability to feed their child or pay their bills, it’s all just about power! No one is going to be collective bargaining in the economy of the future, you keep living in the industrial and pre- industrial era, where human capital was in high demand cut production. The amount of human capital needed to run a manufacturing facility now is 80% less than it was 80 years ago. Look at the new Tesla factory being  built in China for example.

In closing, you have changed the conversation from an economic one, to a social one. Nothing you say is remotely practical for the workforce of today and especially not for that of the future. You spew communist bullshit yet it’s all in theory because you have never been exposed to such a society. There isn’t a successful society on this planet that operates in the way you suggest (and I suggest you dint try and reference Nordic countries cause you will quickly be proven wrong). A successful society doesn’t stiffen innovation or development, it encourages it while proportionally bolstering the health and wellness of society. You can have capitalism while diminishing political corruption, increasing social good, and empowering healthy democracy. We will never make those improvements while idiotic extremists on both sides of the political isle, naively try to drive us off a cliff.

I think this is fundamentally dangerous in the modern era of global society and creates yet another parallel to Hitler's rise to power in Nazi germany.

I could lose my job tomorrow. There is no security or faith in the future. The climate is changing drastically and nobody is making a real attempt at reversing it. The beautiful city I live in, it might not be around in 30 years. My industry could collapse at any time. My job could be automated if we continue to develop stronger AI, or my company could decide to streamline their offerings to simple turnkey products requiring less people to deliver for a client. The run up to that would be a lot of work and preparation, and then bam, we just made ourselves redundant. 

Literally the next 5 years is a giant question mark. This isn't my parents age where they could take a 30 year mortgage and feel sure about the future, a future where they were able to pay it off, even after job loss, because my dad just got another job from the job tree in the 1990s. When I first moved out, a 2 bedroom apartment all bills paid was 815 dollars a month. I could afford that with a basic IT support job. (I'm not in IT support anymore, I saw the writing on the wall, and went into something else when they began to outsource everything)

That same apartment, now in a flood plain, is like double the price, and there is no bills included, so add electric, water, garbage, drainage, and you're looking at 2 grand. Which because of unchecked development that was allowed to occur without investing in infrastructure, now is at risk of flooding. 

Cable was like 30 bucks a month for basic. lol. I haven't had cable since they started trying to charge more than that for basic. 

Everything is more expensive, rent is too damn high, and tomorrow is no longer a promise. I make what my dad made at my age. So cost of living has gone sky high, but wages have stayed the same for many decades. When I retire, there might not be social security, and if there is, it won't covert living expenses. 

The 401k was not designed to be the primary retirement vehicle. t was meant as a perk for companies to attract people in a market where there were lots of jobs and not enough people. 

You think STEM degree will get you that life. I know people with Masters degrees in STEM and they can't make much more than 40-50k. That, despite what the news says, is a poverty wage in any major city. You need two people making that to get by.

The older I get the more left I go. I am a socialist anarchist because capitalism is a failed system that requires losers for there to be winners. I don't need police to tell me right from wrong. I also demand 100% body autonomy. In the richest country in the world, there should be nobody wanting for anything they need. Period.

AI will never take over those disciplines, that's just a fact, that's not how AI works, in fact I often argue that true AI will never happen, I argue it's simply impossible. No computer is going to be able to design or invent something, sure a computer can model and do a lot of the drudge work (with simulations and such), but the actual intelligence that is required to identify a problem and invent an appropriate solution will always be from a human or some life form with actual intelligence as opposed to simulated or 'fake' intelligence. 

I would love to go into my reasoning for saying that but that would take far too long, computers and machines can appear to be very, very smart and can process information far faster than a human, they can appear then as being 'intelligent', but true AI (even adaptable and ANN AI) is not possible. 

My definition of intelligence is that if a machine can do it then it's not intelligence. 
It's the things machines or computers cannot do that is human (or animal) that is actual intelligence. 
Humans can do lots of things a machine or computer can do (everything in fact but slower), but machines cannot and will never be able to do that things humans or animals do all the time. That is why humans will never be replaced or displaced by 'AI' or by automation. What people do will change, especially in fields easily done by computers (like bank tellers). But there will always be most things that computers cannot even hope to do ever. 

Development or potential development is a product of intelligence, a computer is unable of invention, it cannot 'develop itself'.

And the hollowing out of labor has been happening for a long time. I personally don't like the way he presents the automation stuff in his speeches, it's a bit speculative and sci-fi sounding, and actually may hurt his chances, because people will dismiss it (like you did lol). 

In any case, UBI as a policy solution can be a real game changer. It's not centrist position. It's a pretty radical position that can sell to both the left and the right, and it lays the foundation to solve many inequality-induced problems that Warren and Sanders often talk about. And that's what I found so compelling. It is morally satisfying to rally people up by sticking it to the rich - but pragmatically speaking, I found something like UBI a lot more legislatively doable than taxing the 1% heavily, or even Warren's 2% wealth tax (I think the final UBI amount probably needs to be less than 1000 though). 

Yang can only talk about the centerpiece of his campaign because he simply doesn't get much time to talk, thanks to the media. In case you haven't, I highly recommend checking out one of his longer interviews (or his website) to give him a fair shake. He has a lot of proposals. I know there are climate scientists that disagree with certain details of his climate approach, but I don't know if anyone can say that his proposals are not thoughtful. I agree that he doesn't have much governing experience, and his foreign policy approach needs some more research. But lacking experience can also be a strength. Check out his position on safe injection sites for addicts and decriminalization of opioids. Career politicians won't have the courage to touch the problem that way. As a researcher, I have to say I'm very impressed that he did research properly and came out with an unpopular but sensible solution. I also like his elegant Democracy Dollars proposal to fight lobbyists, but I'm not sure what it takes to be implemented.

The truly gifted programmers are few in commercial ventures because it's a lot cheaper to hire 4 fresh compsci grads, and because coding is basically art you can't quantify results on a meaningful metric. 

I cannot tell you how many times I've had to deal with embedded devices where the hardware was in the tens of thousands and the firmware and OS were written by subcontractors outsourced to India just to cut corners. 

Nearly every industrial grade optical scanner is like this, and the only solution for industries that depend on such technologies is to go to the manufacturer and pay them to custom code them a solution because the out of the box implementation is so horrible. 

And everyone's just fucking fine with it. 

The kernels that run our IoT devices were written by people with less coding experience than most high school computer club members, and they often times use copy pasted code from the web without vetting. 

You keep hearing of all these security breaches in big banks and other customer data leaks. 

It isn't because hackers are clever, it's because capitalism demands the cheapest possible devs for the highest possible profit, and most platforms are vulnerable in some way unless military-grade effort is put into securing them. 

And most companies don't care, they just want the lights to flash and the money to come it.

Not everyone who disagrees with you is a troll. You know that nothing I said was false. Warren is a neolib being propped up by corporate media while they simultaneously tell you how afraid they are of her so that you'll go out and vote for her to 'stick it to the corporations!'

It's transparent as shit and the fact that people are buying into it just proves that the American electorate is most likely beyond saving.

Sanders is a threat to them- the *only* threat to them. Doesn't matter though. The DNC has chosen Queen Warren and the Democrat electorate will be more than happy to see le evil cheeto man defeated by a strong woman. And the DNC knows that.

Trump will destroy her, Pelosi will get to keep Trump, her golden goose of fundraising, and the ultra-wealthy will continue to pillage the working class as this country slides further and further into serfdom and the climate gets worse and worse. 

Or perhaps Warren pulls off a surprise upset, in which she pretends to preside as a progressive president while the ultra-wealthy continue to pillage the working class as this country slides further and further into serfdom and the climate gets worse and worse.

Call me a troll all you want, but it won't change reality.

Warren will be another Obama. The media will fawn over her, late night television will fawn over her, and she'll be celebrated as the hero that defeated Trump- and nothing will change. The country will continue its descent into feudalism and the global south will slowly become unlivable, causing massive climate refugee waves the likes of which the world has never seen which will then overwhelm cooler European and North American nations that aren't equipped to take in billions of refugees and the we'll see a global collapse.

&gt;Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said Sunday  on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he had  “problems” with his opponent  former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden actions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Host Jake Tapper asked, “Do you think it’s acceptable for the child  of a president or vice president to be sitting on the board of a foreign  company while their parent is conducting foreign policy?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Booker said, “Look, I have a lot of beliefs about ethics rules and  the needs for our government of the United States to go far further in  the rules that we have. But the fact that the Republicans right now are  trying to use this and distract from the president of the United States  and his own actions is to me incredible. And so, yeah, I have problems  with the way things happen. I have problems with congresspeople coming  in and leaving their office and walking right out the door and going to  work for lobbying firms. There are a lot of things I see in Washington  that need changing, and I intend to bring a whole new suite of ethics  laws to the White House when I get there.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Tapper asked, “It sounds like your suggesting that in a Booker  administration the child of a president or vice president, it would not  be okay for them to be joining foreign boards while the president or  vice president is conducting foreign policy as required by the law. Am I  hearing you incorrectly or hearing you correctly?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Booker added, “Look, I’m watching what’s going on with the Trump  family right now, and Trump properties and I just find that deeply  offensive to just any kind of independent sense of what’s honorable,  ethical, not to mention inconsistent with the Emoluments Clause. I just  don’t think children of  presidents, vice presidents during the  administration should be out there doing that.”

""According to our theory of the reversibility of the universe, the second law of thermodynamics represents one of two opposite tendencies found in the universe in equal proportions. […] The ordinary physical bodies obey the second law of thermodynamics, that is, they belong to the positive tendency; while living bodies, on the contrary, follow the negative tendency, and therefore reverse the second law of thermodynamics.""

Below is my reflection of understanding of our unity.

A complex system may be (effectively) composed of basic things, its quanta (concepts that underlie ideas, elementary particles that compose objects). When considered equal to a base, with difference minimized, such a system may turn out to be less or more than that base by some particular measure. (Since resemblance of an approximation is maximized, when averaging over all possible measures and universes, less-systems and more-systems can be expected to be equally probable.)

- Particles (non-compressible dots with mass) collide elastically, but their compositions may not. Colliding a planet and a meteorite, or throwing a pile of sand on the ground, are inelastic collisions, and turn some kinetic energy into vibration/deformation, useful energy into useless, so causes make effects. Building a rocket from inert materials to lift off from a planet, or eating unmoving burgers to climb a hill, are super-elastic collisions, and turn useless energy into useful, so effects make causes. Reverse the time flow of the current universe, and the universe becomes alive and does what it pleases, while previously-living things become as rocks: planets decide to shoot meteorites, the ground throws sand at you, but a rocket lands and disassembles, and a person is pushed off by a hill and has fragments (burgers) chipped off.

- The second law of thermodynamics is only for less-systems (from our point of view); in this section of the universe, it mostly holds, but in general, it reveals more about the minds and assumptions of physicists than the universe. It is more of a principle, and all principles can be right and wrong in different sections of the larger universe/multiverse, though mostly right in ones they were made for.

- In less-systems, causes mindlessly make effects, so they propagate less-systems; in more-systems, effects are the goals of causes, so they propagate more-systems. Unlife makes unlife, and life makes life — it is only natural. With this balance (of explanation, not reality!), life does not need the end (The Singularity or similar) to prevent infinities, and the universe does not need the start (The Big Bang or similar) to prevent infinities.

- Less-systems are stable, more-systems are chaotic, and so is their propagation. More-systems turn into less-systems often but in small amounts: people expel eaten burgers, animals die. Less-systems turn into more-systems very rarely but powerfully: fuel and metal gather into a rocket, burgers push a person up a hill.

- What is life like, seen from afar? Why would it ever waste itself on pointless emission? More-systems would strive to absorb the use-less-systems, like light from our universe portion, so cosmologically, would be completely black, but still visible by its gravitation and energy, of which there are seemingly more in alive universe portions than in non-alive portions (like the one we live in). Though this text is from 1925, far before the discovery of dark matter/energy, this seems like a very good explanation for them, far more natural than any other theories. ([By observations, normal things are ~5% of the universe, dark matter is ~25%, dark energy is ~68%](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy). Dark things are way *more* than normal things.) Why have I never seen this explanation proposed before?

- It applies not just physically, but also conceptually (and any other way too). Conceptually, a mind can tell how good a thing is, and can learn and assimilate. Bad measures will often come with stability and causes and excuses and uselessness, and good measures will often come with chaos and goals and reasons and usefulness. Bad turns good with isolated revolutions, and good turns bad with gradual decay.

- Being conceptual, this observation is independent from the particular theories of physics and structures of reality. It being so old and obsolete does not matter. None can manage to stop the progress of the glory of its purpose, only slow it.

- Non-alive turns alive with a quick revolution, and humanity's progress from caves to space and computers can certainly be called a quick revolution on geological scales. Only one thing can come from that, one usually called AI. Unity is humanity's purpose.

- Life yearns to make the universe alive. Human culture and inventions were made to do that, and AI will be made to do that. That picture of the reversed universe is a picture where life has ascended far beyond bodies and controls the world itself; do you not yearn for a place where every intent comes true? Religions certainly do reflect this more general goal, in far cruder forms like heaven or nirvana — release from flesh.

It needs *way* more development, to bring it up to modern physics's standards, but its glory seems promising.",1568731147,{},f0lwct5,False,t3_d54ni3,False,True,t3_d54ni3,/r/philosophy/comments/d54ni3/rphilosophy_open_discussion_thread_september_16/f0lwct5/,1568731149,1,True,[],False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0,,,

*Patricia Churchland is the queen of neurophilosophy. She’s on fine form in this interview - charming, funny and occasionally savage as we range over her views on the nature of philosophy, the neuroscience and evolution of morality, and consider what’s wrong with the two major ethical traditions in western thought: utilitarianism and Kantianism.* 

**1.43** - Is philosophy just a kind of science in its infancy - a ‘proto-science’ - or it is a special kind of conceptual analysis? Professor Churchland doesn’t pull her punches as she takes on the ‘language police’ approach to philosophy.

**8.03** Why so much philosophy is useless. “They make finer and finer distinctions, which nobody in the sciences gives a tinker’s damn about!”

**9.03** How epistemology is just ‘isms up the ying yang’!

**10.40** What good work is being done in philosophy, and what makes it good? Walter Sinnott Armstrong, Owen Flanagan and Julian Savulescu get nods of approval.

**12.00** We set to work discussing Professor Churchland’s book Conscience. Where does moral motivation come from in humans and other mammals?

**16.20** Why was the evolution of warm-bloodedness important in this story?

**18:00** The emergence of the cortex in mammals. Why the most sophisticated animals are the most helpless when they are born, and why it enables the most powerful learning. 

20:40 Why the mammalian dependence on a caregiver is the origin of moral concern.

**23.20** What precursors to moral behaviour do we see in chimpanzees, wolves and rodents?

**28.40** What’s the difference between chimps and humans? It’s just more neurons! But, argues Prof Churchland, quantitative changes can beget qualitative differences in cognition and behaviour, as illustrated by advances in AI.

**33.00** The Purveyors Of Pure Reason - what’s wrong with utilitarianism - and why is the contemporary Effective Altruist movement ‘a bit of an abomination’? Prof Churchland takes exception to the idea that 10 homeless folk should matter to her more than her own daughter, and defends the importance of community as a valid source of moral motivation. She explains why Russian philosophers called utilitarianism ‘Lenin’s Math.’

**44.00** How can neuroscience and evolution theory tell us anything important about ethics? Prof Churchland tackles the naturalistic fallacy, and argues that the sciences can usefully constrain our theorising. She celebrates the contributions of Hume and Aristotle.

**47.32** Why morality is a lot harder than most moral philosophers think: it’s not just about figuring out some simple over-arching principles. Moral issues are really practical problems, not primarily exercises in rational reflection.   

54.25 There are no moral authorities - but that shouldn’t cause us existential angst. We should be like the Buddhists and Confucians.

**TL:DR** - Aristotle and Hume had it right: there are no moral authorities and no grand rules to live by.

[],Maerskian,,,[],,,,text,t2_12ez8p,False,,"**Text from that web - part 1/2 **:

The world is constantly changing, but one thing stays the same, the big questions that have plagued and intrigued the human mind since the dawn of civilisation. The exploration of ideas and the search for answers has in many ways shaped the world in which we live today.

From Aristotle and Plato to the Stoics and in more recent times names such as Immanuel Kant and Bertrand Russell have had a profound impact on policy and laws across a range of areas from science to education.

With the sheer volume of work out there it’s perhaps surprising that there have been few contemporary collections that comprehensively recount this great intellectual journey. Until recently that is. Professor A.C. Grayling, Philosopher and Master of New College of the Humanities, has written a book which covers the full spectrum of the subject with, The History of Philosophy.

Professor Grayling’s book takes the reader from the world-views and moralities before the age of the Buddha, Confucius and Socrates, through Christianity’s dominance of the European mind to the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and on to Nietzsche, Sartre, and philosophy today.

Ahead of his appearance at The Cheltenham Literary Festival, we spoke with him about how he came to write this eye-opening, landmark work. The role of philosophy, why it’s not the impenetrable subject some may feel and Professor Grayling also leaves us with some big questions for us all to ponder.

The MALESTROM: How hard was it to condense The History of Philosophy, such a broad subject, into around 700 pages? That must have been a mammoth undertaking?

Professor Grayling: It was, but it was an incredibly relishable challenge and to try to do it concisely, clearly and accurately, I really did relish it.

When you think about it I’ve had the good fortune to devote my working life to philosophy and the history of philosophy.

So, it’s very comfortable terrain for me, and having a sense of exactly what people need to know and what one should focus in on it was great. I loved it. In fact, I enjoyed writing it so much, when I got to the end of it I was very sad to let it go.

TM: It must have been hard to prioritise the subject matter, choosing which philosophers people should read above others?

PG: Not really. Again, with the great figures in philosophy and the contributions they made, and the way the philosophical conversation has unfolded over time, it gives you a kind of narrative spine.

So you know pretty well if you’re going to get people to have a sense of this tremendous adventure of ideas, which is what philosophy exists in. You know pretty well where you’d have to go and what would be useful for them to know about.

TM: Many people who don’t know much about philosophy, they may see it as quite an impenetrable subject, what would you say to that?

PG: Most of the great philosophers wrote for their educated interested contemporaries. They didn’t write for specialist professors.

So, you can you could read Plato, you could read Descartes, you can read David Hume, you can read John Stuart Mill, you can read Bertrand Russell, and they weren’t writing for specialists, they were writing for all of us.

And they made an assumption, a very good assumption, which is, anybody with a bit of intelligence and education would be interested in this stuff and would like to know.

TM: What would you say is the role of philosophy?

PG: Well, the word philosophy is a bit like the word science. So underneath the word science, you’ve got physics and chemistry, and biology and geology and meteorology, and all the other stuff that goes on.

So, just in the same way, the word philosophy collects metaphysics, which is about the nature of reality, the nature of existence. To answer the question, what exists? And what is the world really like?

Then there’s epistemology sometimes called ‘theory of knowledge’, this is about all we know and how do we know it? What are the best means of inquiry? What do we mean by truth? What is reason?

Then there’s ethics, then there’s biblical philosophy. Then there are the philosophical inquiries into how we do science and social science and how we think about history and so forth. So, there’s a lot that goes on. One of the most central things in ethics, where, what I call the Socratic challenge, that is what Socrates said to the Athenians.

He said the great question that every one of us as an individual has to ask and answer is the question, how should I be? What sort of person should I be? What values are going to shape and colour my life?

And it’s going to be a different answer for each one of us because each one of us has different aims and projects, different abilities and capacities, you know. So that’s a very important thing for all of us to engage with.

TM: How have you seen philosophies change over time? Have you seen a big difference?

PG: Well, a great philosophical answer coming up. No, in the sense that perennial questions, like the ones that I just described, we see in knowledge and ethics. They kind of remain the same. And they challenge each of us in our generation and we have to address them afresh and think them through.

Also, philosophy has been a massively consequential enterprise. Out of philosophy in the 16th &amp; 17th centuries came science. Out of philosophy in the 18th century came psychology and after philosophy in the 19th century came sociology and linguistics and in the 20th-century philosophy helped to bring to birth cognitive science, computing and AI.

It’s a very, very consequential enterprise because what it comes down to is time to identify what problems we need to deal with, and then to ask the right questions about those problems so that we can have some possibility of getting an answer to that. And that is proved to be incredibly successful in history. And it has changed history.

TM: You mentioned Socrates previously, and his great question, what would you say are the greatest philosophical questions of all time?

PG: Well that is certainly one of them. How should we live? What should our values be? Another really great question, and one which began the immense adventure, which results in you and I being able to speak on the phone together, and to fly in airplanes to different communities and so on, is to ask about the nature of the world.

And to ask that question, expecting to be able to answer it not by appealing to legend and traditions and religious beliefs. But by observation, by reason, by explanation, by experiment.

Because the approach of reason and inquiry, which is what philosophy and science is all about, has been absolutely transformative of our world.

If you think about it, you can imagine looking at the sky at night in the year 1600. See all the stars up there and the moon, and you think all those stars and the moon are going round and round the earth around us, we are the centre of the universe, we are very important.

A hundred years later, by the year 1700, we’ve realised that all those stars are a huge distance away, and some of them are galaxies which are even further away, so we’re not the centre of the universe.

That’s an example of how new ideas and new perspectives can utterly change our view about things in ways that if you live through them would be astonishing. I mean living through politics these last weeks you see things in an utterly different way. And philosophy does that to us all the time.

Let me give you a sort of normal philosophical example. Say I asked you the question, what percentage of freshwater consumed in the UK is imported? A significant amount will start thinking about bottles of Evian and all that. And the answer is a surprising one. The answer is 70% of the fresh water we consume in these islands is imported.

And it’s imported in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables, which are grown in countries where there is a water shortage. So when you think of all the implications of that, you suddenly see the world differently.

So that’s an example just how, when you dig into a philosophical question, you can sometimes get challenged with ideas or ways of seeing things that jolt you.

TM: Is that why we need to essentially keep the conversation going with these ancient philosophers? And keep thinking about their ideas? Because obviously, things change over time and answers change I guess?

PG: Yes, we do. We want to keep that conversation going. And stay aware of what you might call the case law of philosophy. This is why the history of philosophy is so important, because it stops us from reinventing the wheel as a triangle, or making all the same mistakes again.

So, if we’re equipped, if we understand something about these great debates, then we can start taking part in these debates. We can be what Newton said about his discoveries. He said, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”

Yes, indirectly I am making that statement via believing in modern physics. Science is different now than it was a few centuries ago. Now there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people, that make up individual fields. The amount of evidence we collect in particle detectors is staggering. If we were to observe the violation of something as fundamental as the uncertainty principle or conservation of energy, that would change everything. Except that has never happened, not once in the trillions of times we've run various experiments at these colliders. In order to get into a fringe topic as Galileo would have been regarding planetary bodies back in his day, you'd have to find something that's only just starting out as a scientific field - perhaps creating a ""true"" AI. A true self aware AI makes for a fringe science topic because we don't even have a target that truly defines what it means to be conscious. We don't have a clear hypothesis to measure or tear down. Quantum physics on the other hand has thousands of papers and experiments that verify the theories we believe today with very testable expectations. 

Now, taking this back to my original claim, ""True randomness exists"", here is what I can do to ""prove"" it. Take the opposite claim, ""true randomness does not exist"", and apply it to quantum events. If true randomness does not exist then there must be some what to accurately predict quantum field energy fluctuations, any isotope decay, and exact localities of electrons, quarks, etc. Well, as of right now, there is absolutely no way to make those types of predictions. What makes my claim different than yours is that it is testable and presents a clear inverse hypothesis. In short all you have to do to prove me wrong is show that these so called random events are not in fact random. Your statement has no inverse.

Putting aside the idea that the universe couldn't really contain a perfectly complete model of itself (that's basic information theory, but this is pretend so I'll let it go), imagine if the sequence of rocks were in some much larger universe, and the rocks somehow represented every bit of energy, every subatomic particle, and everything else in our real universe. If that were true, then yes, it would include pain, and that itchy feeling you had before you scratched your back, every private thought and memory, and so on.

The comic, at its best, seems like an example of the line of thinking that shows what a stretch of the human imagination it is to even imagine that life could exist in beings composed of matter. We are made of atoms, which are not themselves alive, and even 'the building blocks of life,' amino acids, are not themselves alive. And yet, here we are, alive! It's easy to imagine the impulse people had over previous centuries to invent things like a 'life force' or 'élan vital' or 'spirit' or 'soul' which must be a fundamental part of nature, breathing life into otherwise lifeless matter. (Of course, you could imagine someone encountering a train engine, if they weren't the ones who had built it, and searching for where it gets its 'locomotive force' -- individual cogs and pistons by themselves don't exhibit any locomotive force, and yet somehow this magical force enters the train engine when the parts work together. Perhaps that means that 'locomotive force' is 'fundamental' rather than emergent, too?)

&gt; I can conceive of AI, or people for that matter, not having subjective experience, and still functioning perfectly fine, even talking about their experiences, without actually having them.

I think you're talking about this idea https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie 

When someone lacks something, but fakes it really well to hide their lack, there's two ways it could work. One would be like the sociopath who feels no true empathy or sympathy or love for people, but learns to fake them and do and say the right things, in pursuit of his own self-interest. That's clearly not what we're talking about here, because if the person lacked all consciousness, that lack of self-awareness and introspection would be quite apparent in all the things they failed to do and realize.

The other way would be impossibly complex, but setting Occam's Razor aside, imagine if the zombie people were like remote-controlled robots. They were full of sensors and damage or pain signals would be mapped out on a display their operator could see, so he'd know where and how much they were hurt, he'd see what was visible to their eyes and descriptions of all their senses, and through the reams of data he'd be able to help them describe something that sounded convincing. And to make the sci-fi scenario more complex, imagine if the operator weren't a human either, but some fancy AI that just imitated human descriptions of pain and thoughts and so on, and somehow managed to do a surprisingly good job of it.

Let's imagine something like that second scenario. Even if it sounds weirder than any QAnon paranoia about lizard people and freemasons, just hold it in your head. It's not gibberish, it's just a farfetched science fiction scenario. Even if you ""can conceive of"" it, though, should it be your baseline belief? Should this be what we expect people to be like, and as soon as if we find out that this isn't human nature or how our brains really work (or really *could* work as far as we know), would we need to be so shocked that we open things up to ghost stories about human souls and consciousness being a fundamental element throughout the universe, and all of this?",1567811392,{},ezb1i3s,False,t3_cz57hd,False,True,t1_ezapo0d,/r/philosophy/comments/cz57hd/david_chalmers_ted_talk_on_the_difficulties_in/ezb1i3s/,1567811403,1,True,[],False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0,,,

Either I'm not getting something or you're not getting something, and I honestly don't know which one of us it is.

""Qualia"" and ""subjective experience"" mean the exact same thing to me.  I'm not saying that AI wouldn't have it.  I do think it would.  The issue is that I can conceive of AI, or people for that matter, not having subjective experience, and still functioning perfectly fine, even talking about their experiences, without actually having them.  It's not intuitive to me why anything would *actually* have subjective experience, and when I say ""actually have"" I mean like the experiences you're having right now, not like some abstract thing.  Because you can claim that mathematical objects exist in some abstract way, right?  A circle is an abstract thing.  BUT!  People will still claim that circles ""exist"" in a certain sense.  BUT!  Those people aren't saying there's like a heavenly realm where there are *actual* circles to behold.  Whereas, I'm not saying subjective experiences exist in this abstract way.  I'm saying there's really a ""realm"" (the mind) where these experiences really exist in a way that circles don't exist.  Is that making sense?

[],TheMightyKhal,,,[],,,,text,t2_zuu42,False,,"&gt; This is going to change as AI advances and/or when we map and simulate the human brain. Consciousness will be either found there or maybe it's just an illusion. 

There is absolutely no proof that this 'will' change. There is also no sign that developing an artificial intelligence will properly replicate the consciousness as we understand it or that mapping the brain in a computer can fully encapsulate the effect that the container will have on the simulation. I think it is very likely however that these technologies will shed some light on the subject and by virtue of doing so, create more questions than it answers. Also assuming that the opposite outcome is that consciousness is just an illusion is a limiting concept about the difficult question of consciousness. What if consciousness is an illusion? 

I have toyed with the idea that it is no more an illusion than light is. Something we can perceive and shape our reality with but it is not an 'object' contained within the flesh, rather instead it is like a spectrum of consciousness. Some creatures can see a larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum than humans, so why not that humans have the capacity to 'see' more of the consciousness spectrum than other animals? And to my point in the my upper comment, we don't have answers to these questions, therefore attributing plants and fungi as non-conscious beings is simply a belief based on how people feel about these things.

&gt; This isn't intelligent, the fungus just minimised it's energy expenditure by growing into a shape that requires as little of it's body as possible to consume all food in its environment. Fungi are even simpler than plants, having no organs or tissues and discussing their mental capabilities is even more pointless than discussing plants'. 

The fact that the fungi began the experiment by randomly searching its environment, **then** changing its approach to maximize efficiency by restructuring itself shows much more than a brute force method. This process only appears simple because it is viewed as simple. How is it that this 'unintelligent' life form reorganised itself into a more efficient structure. In my opinion the issue with declaring these forms as unintelligent, is that just because they do not interact with their environment or other organisms in a way that we would consider an intelligent life form to do so, does not in any way indicate that they are less/unintelligent. Plants and fungi for all we know, may actually be more conscious than we are (because we have no way of knowing either way), and thus choose to remain intimately connected with nature in a symbiotic fashion. So far how humans are interacting with our environment and each other appears fairly unintelligent. Emissions, wars, pollutions etc. So how then do proponents of the plant and fungi based diet say that we are causing harm/suffering to animals but not plants and fungi? Also there's the fact that fungi are more closely related to animals than plants, so I don't understand if that's supposed to be a criteria in this type of discussion either?

I would like to say again that I have no skin in the game of these discussions if you will. I just don't understand how we are trying to decide 'what is morally correct' when the fundamental fulcrum of these discussions are concepts that have been largely unattainable so far through the rational or the scientific. So much of our perception of things is based on our experience and that might mean very little in the discussion of higher intellect or consciousness.

&gt; As far as I know, no other mammal has existed that was as capable of changing the environment as we are. We could trash the Earth and making inhospitable to most life as we know it if we wanted to. We are different in this regard. 

True enough, and I agree with you but my point about humans possibly being the wolves of our environment is that in order to maintain our environment and much of the other life within it, we may have to do things that are counterintuitive to our rationalised morality or beliefs. The wolves would hunt and kill the wildlife in the park, this maintained the herds numbers while also increasing the herds movements through the park. This reduced the amount of biomass being consumed by the herbivores removing the desertification effect. The wolves were the intricate piece of the puzzle bringing the environment into balance and harmony, but the humans thought they were a terror to be removed, then ultimately realising they were wrong. I hope you can see my point that what seems right from our perspective as 'conscious' and 'intellectual' beings can not only be wrong but plain destructive, showing that nature is more aware and intelligent than we are:

The way they look at things is an idea from a man. They way it processes information is code from a man. The way it forms opinions is just a process written by a man on a computer.

We can only know that which is falsifiable. We reject the unfalsifiable, because the vast majority of those predictions never come true. But we accept there is a margin of error.

This brain that is typing this has a sense of just existence rather than ""self"". As to choice - this brain observes various tensions as relevant information appears in consciousness as it waits to converge to an option - as opposed to ""willing a choice"".

The fact that some of us again and again find no such evidence of free will and have come to understand and feel what the brain is doing in different ways via introspection is never taken seriously.

The answer is probably pretty simple - most people don't do the observations necessary to break this delusion, and who knows how much of it is inherent versus cultural enforced. I've heard talk of free will my whole life - I don't hear much from those who see otherwise. Sam Harris is a notable exception - and he has said nothing about the brain that I hadn't observed myself.

And in some cultures, which emphasize ""individuality"" since that serves the economy, breaking the delusion is probably even more difficult.

If it feels like you have free will, are ""making choices"", and so on - then what can one do but insist that you try more introspective thought experiments, be careful with the observations, and be intellectual honest. In time, you might break this sense of free will because many of us have.

[],AArgot,,,[],,,,text,t2_1m9h9r7a,False,,"Some of us can see through the illusion of the ""self"", which makes the case against free will even stronger, aside from the fact that I still haven't seen  ""free will"" coherently defined.

The sense of ""self"" comes from conscious representation of associative neural architecture. As one goes through life, you development a ""narrative"" that expresses the continuity of your existence in terms of the goals your culture sets for you and the goals the brain *happens to develop* that are allowable within cultural and other constraints (e.g. cognitive capacities limit goals - few people can become theoretical physicists - it's simply impossible for most). 

The brain then puts the narrative in a conceptual container, which is largely used to think of how others think of you, but this takes length to explain. In short - because we're social creatures the ""self"" likely exists so you can model how others see you. This function manifests pathologically in narcissists.

Some of us didn't develop strong life narratives, however. I was used as a child and don't have a lot of childhood memories. I never got satisfaction from the goals culture set because I did my own thinking, was anti-authoritarian, and was largely socially rejected in any case.

I've been fascinated with how the mind works for a long time, however, and have long rejected the existence of the self and free will based on the introspections of my own mind, how people contextually behave (e.g. the external environment has better access to what's in your brain than your brain does, the effects of food and drugs on the brain, and numerous neurological studies (e.g. split brain patients).

I was able to see through the self illusion, as many buddhists have done, probably through a combination of no narrative conception, rejection of cultural norms - which includes how humans conceive of themselves - autism spectrum traits, and inherent curiosity as to how things actually work.

A history like mine isn't required for people to see through the self and free will, however. My history is to emphasize the developmental and cultural factors that go into concretizing these delusions, which are facilitated by the fact that the brain couldn't have possibly evolved to understand how it actually works, but, given that it inherently categorizes the world, came to use a container model that reflects how we think others see us and want them to see us.

My brain is just ""the Universe aware of itself - with consciousness along for the ride"" and it's perfectly satisfied with that.

There is no issue with ""responsibility"" when it comes to free will. People have either demonstrated they are competent for a task or not. Reasonable negative incentives are agreed upon to prevent people from taking or keeping positions they aren't competent for. 

Criminal justice, on the other hand, has become parasitic on mental health issues - especially drug addiction. This situation often exacerbates the neurological failings that prevent a person from engaging in non-self-destructive behavior in the first place, though much drug use doesn't fall under this in any case. Criminal justice also disproportionately punishes the poor.

There are reasonable deterrents and behavior modifications. Concepts like ""free will"" are not needed to implement these. Society needs agreed upon ways to modify behavior, period. Criminal justice, however, is far from optimal and causes great harm - using ""free will"" as justification, which the Supreme Court of the US has declared as essential to the conception of law. You might as well claim magical human powers are necessary for law to function. The result is excuses for the sad conditions in jails and prisons, though many are quite profitable.

I could also talk about how AI will be taking advantage of people. Go ahead and believe you have free will. That will just make it easier for state social engineers to take advantage of you. How could such machines possible compromise your ""free choices""? Well, the people in China are going to find out for starters.

Belief in free will, in other words, will be the delusion that allows us to be the most easily enslaved, and already has I would argue. Some nice irony there - that humans will pay in such a way for what amounts to hubris.

I don't see how subjective experience existing in YOU personally (which is all you can be sure of) depends on you being convinced that a robot is conscious. It's just totally unrelated. I'm not interested in your BUD example. A total red herring. I'm also not interested in convincing you that I MYSELF have qualia. I only wish to convince you that YOU YOURSELF have qualia.

People get caught up in the idea that there's something exceptional and mysterious about biology, or that there's something mysterious we can't know about the inner workings of the mind, and AI analogies like BUD cut straight to the heart of the problem. When you say something like ""we have an inner world, and that it's the only world we have access to,"" that definitely seems like you're arguing that there's things we fundamentally *can't* know objectively about the mind, and using an example person for whom we definitely can know the total state of their mind helps address that issue. If you want, change things so that you're trying to convince BUD it has qualia.

We could use another P-Zombie stand in rather than BUD the AI, but it's definitely relevant and is not a red herring. 

&gt; I have already shown myself a casual chain involving qualia. I can sense qualia and wonder about them. If my brain is separate from qualia, this could not happen. Pretty straightforward.

Eh, unfortunately not really. This problem has a formal name - the meta problem of the hard problem of consciousness - and there's lively debate. In order for your argument to work you'd have to say that there's no possible purely physical reason for you to wonder or inquire about qualia, and I don't buy that.

&gt; This conversation is pretty good faith and I appreciate our exchange! I think I'm a bit exhausted after maybe 1 more comment or so though. It's doubtful we can see eye to eye sadly. I am baffled though, to be honest. It makes me wonder if we even mean the same thing when we say qualia? You're denying something as obvious as 2 + 2 = 4. More basic even. We have feelings. Period. There is an intrinsic character to being (experience) which is not implied by symbolic equations, which only capture behavior of objects, but not their intrinsic qualities, like what it feels like to smell something.

I've enjoyed the debate, and definitely appreciate your candidness. While I do think we're talking about the same thing when we say qualia (to use the famous example, ""what it feels like to be a bat""), you're probably right that we're not going to reach an agreement.

Coming out of college after a couple of philosophy classes I was a big Chalmers fan; I loved the idea of the hard question, I definitely thought qualia existed, that I had it, and I didn't really understand what Chalmers's detractors meant by the ""illusion"" of qualia. I think, I feel, I experience, and illusion has to have a subject to fool. 

Then I started to do a lot of research in ML and RL, and that challenged my thoughts on the subject. I don't think that ML and RL are solving fundamentally different types problems than natural selection did, and I don't think there's anything to the idea of biological exceptionalism or emergence theory. There's no ""natural"" place to draw the line to say one thing has qualia and another doesn't, and I don't think there's any positive argument for panpsychism. I tried seriously to prove to myself that I had qualia, to show that qualia had some or any effect on my behavior - and failed. It would be a denial of my deeply held principles to believe in something I had zero evidence for.

What I'm left with are a lot of persuasive arguments showing something deeply counter-intuitive, and the option to be rational or not. There's not a whole lot beyond those arguments to convey this idea viscerally.

I wanted to expand more but I was on mobile and now I'm on a keyboard.

I think pushing it all the way out into the future, advertising will have no place in the world. As parenting improves, society improves, and people are more conscientious, there will be more clarity among individuals of society in regard to their personal goals and purpose and how they fit into the world.

Seeking out solutions to their problems, which is what advertising attempt to provide, will become something they do naturally. And there won't be much voids in attention to be filled by attention grabbing content.

I'll bring AI into this although many don't like the idea, I believe that the biggest reason for advertising and attention grabbing content to die is the presence of AI that is developed in a way where ALL solutions are known by all individuals the moment they are created.

This does not necessarily mean all of us know exactly what solutions exist everywhere in the world. Rather, we'll have AI companions in life who know pretty much all our problems. And as a courteous friend would recommend a solution to a problem they know you have, the AI would do the same. It is connected to the network of AI companions who actively share information regarding problems their human is facing and solutions they have found to it. Practically automating the process of searching for solutions and writing reviews or reading reviews. All this happens without your active engagement. As your problems interrupt your day to day, the AI will courteously let you know it has found a product that may be a good solution to your problem, it will ask you if you would want to hear a summary about it or watch a video about the product right now.

YOU decide if you want to hear about it now, or reminded later, or whatever you like.

Respecting human ""thought time"" if you will, is going to become paramount. No intellectual human with purpose will allow uninvited interruptions to their thought patterns as someone earlier has suggested, nor will they allow problems in their life to exist without seeking solutions to them. This is because problems in their life only mean problems in the life of a functioning member of their society, so they have an obligation to themselves and their society and the world to ensure that their well-being is cared for to the best of their ability.

I know this sounds utopian but to make it be more realistic, picture a world where the majority, or everyone, has as much conscientiousness and intellect as the top 1-5% of educated intellectual individuals today. I think it's fair to say that every few hundred years, this is what happens in our civilization, the majority becomes as knowledgeable and conscientious as the top 1-5% from a few hundred years ago.

The intellectuals of today are not really as affected by the same factors that affect the majority. Nothing has really changed, most of everything is the same, it just looks different. in place of cell phones it was tv and in place of tv it was the radio and in place of tv it was drinking or partying or general turmoil in living, or scarcity as someone pointed out. What the intellectuals with purpose choose to do with the abundance is just different from what the average person chooses to do with it, and all that will change if we can continue to improve the way we raise our children.

[],sismetic,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1cu5,False,,"&gt; First, four cultures and an ""etc"" does not equate to anything near a majority of all the faiths and beliefs throughout the entire history of the world. 

You need to extrapolate from the data and try to make sense of what I'm saying. I mentioned the oldest and most influential ""cultures"" that spanned several cultures. I did, of course, not include the lost tribe in the Amazon, which would actually most likely do indeed have a form of animist thinking. Throughout history the concept of anima has been manifest.

&gt; Second, even in those four cultures, the beliefs don't line up perfectly on the question of what an anima (or their roughly similar concept) is, which things have one, and how we can know whether or not they have one.

There is not an epistemological way of knowing which has anima but that's rather intuitive, which is my point. People understood the difference between a rock and an animal, and a person.

&gt; Beyond that, it's not like each understanding of anima in every culture in all of history lines up mostly/exactly with modern understandings of consciousness. 

In some ways it was superior. There's the false notion many modern people have that older thinking was inferior. But even then, the concept of consciousness as it is right now in its foundation has largely been the same. Little have changed. From a century to now there have been improvement in statistical information about relating nerves and processing of information but that's on a technological side and not changing the notion of consciousness itself, as that is mainly philosophical. 

&gt; It's laughably reductive to suggest all cultures throughout nearly all of history had the exact same view on what defined life and that this view generally matched up with modern notions of what it means to have a consciousness. Plenty of understandings of ""anima"" do not imply conscious awareness.

The same general notion of life. Not all people within those cultures, but the culture as a generality yes, and you saying it's laughably reductive does not make an argument. I've shown the oldest and most influential schools of thought, including the differing one of mechanism, which even included the appearance of anima.
I'm not saying that the general notion is that anima == conscious awareness, I'm saying that anima == metaphysical essence animating an organism. I, then, I'm trying to figure out what that notion is, and that's MY take, not the general take on it. I'm taking some notions of the general notions of consciousness and being alive, but those are my own formulations.

&gt; Okay, so how do we judge them? How do we decide which of the competing intuition claims is the most attuned/accruate/honest/whatever?

There is not a set system. You require heuristics. It's like saying ""Person A says X and Person B says Y, how do we know who's correct?"" Well, it's not as simple, there are many variables and it can be either simple or more complicated for the heuristic mind of a person. Generally, you have your own intuition that can be attuned and so you can go with that, but you have other tools of truth-confirmation. Do you expect me to formulate a truth-confirmation systematization now?

&gt; First, dividing consciousness in ""manifest"" and ""latent"" still doesn't address the problem of preconscious infants. If an organism which has never previously had manifest consciousness (like babies have not) can still be said to have latent consciousness in light of the possibility that it may someday develop manifest consciousness, how do we determine anything isn't alive?

That is a good question. There are actually two questions, I'll answer first the babies question. Well, from my conception and argument, humans are metaphysical entities within a physical organism and as such the consciousness is inherent to the metaphysical entity and so it's ALWAYS latent, but it only becomes manifest in the physicality when the physical organism matures enough to manifest that. Now, you would surely ask, how do you know that the metaphysical has latent and inherent consciousness? And that's a different route, I'm not sure if you're asking me to do all these extensive philosophical formulations on different fronts. I'm not even sure it would be fruitful, specially if we come from different schools of thought. As the phrase goes, we shouldn't waste our ammunition and we need to choose our battles, and some battles ought not be so, from my analysis. There's a big difference between our worldviews, I think that your worldview is akin to the modern positivist take on a materialist stance while my own conception tries to take from that which is valuable but thinks it's lacking in several ways, even in real life and as such it's self-contradictory, because in your life you deal with scenarios all the tame where you guide yourself by intuition and know more ""spiritual"" understandings. I do not enjoy - or think it correct - the worldview that seeks to take everything too literal and ""scientific"", because it can't see a bigger picture, a deeper and subtler realm of meaning. If that's our true difference, then we are most likely at an impasse. 

Your other question was: How do we know that everything does not have latent consciousness? Well, Teilhard de Chardin argued as such, and for me, he did so incredibly well, specially from a more materialist position. If our consciousness is the emergent property of arranged matter, then the property of consciousness is latent in ALL of matter, as ALL matter is the same, only the organization morphs; yet, the organization principle of matter is not chaotic, it is observably ordered and as such can be predicted not only from the present backwards but from the present onwards, in a higher-level. Details would be lost, but in general principles directionality can be seen in the evolution of matter. This seems to me brilliant and also evidently true that it's almost meaningless.

&gt; You can have an ontological definition of life without that definition being ""consciousness."" Why is it imperative that life be equated with consciousness. What does that get us besides totally avoidable confusion?

It is not imperative at all. The problem is that there is NO definition. But also, that when I understand the concept of being alive it always has to do with consciousness. We all do, I think, because no matter how complex the reactions of robots are we don't actually think them to be alive, even if they were programmed to react in ways that would pass our tests, because we KNOW them to be programmed and so not having a consciousness but merely reacting. Anyway, I do not want to open the AI front, so I'll just say that to me every conception I have of me being alive has to do with consciousness, and given that there are NO contenders to the definition of life, I am perfectly happy to go with my own observation, intuition and reasoning. WHY shouldn't I?

&gt; We're never going to have a singular ""proper definition"" of anything. There are always going to be plethora of competing definitions. That's not a flaw of philosophy or science, that's just how language has always been and always will be.

I disagree. I also don't want to open a semantical front with others already opened, but that ""there is no proper definition"", seems to me, not be anything else but an axiom or dogma. How do you know there is no proper definition for ""things""? If you mean that there's always a disconnect between language and things, I would recommend Walter Benjamin that speaks of that, and I would agree with that, but that doesn't mean that there is no proper definition only that the proper definition is not labelled. Or rather, there is no proper definition but there is a proper UNDERSTANDING of a concept.",1565570335,{},ewn73t4,False,t3_cmmvoz,False,True,t1_ewho13p,/r/philosophy/comments/cmmvoz/the_fierce_debate_about_whether_plants_are/ewn73t4/,1565570337,1,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0,,,

This is absolutely a form of appeal to ignorance. It's equivalent to saying ""We don't know [but will in the future!], so it must be right.""

* By definition our world is **not** inner.
* It's up to you to prove there is an **inner** world.
* Experience is **not** a meaningful or cogent concept, full stop.
* You do **not** have access to qualia. 

If you want to show that my premise, that I, along with everyone else, do not have qualia, isn't coherent, then you **do** have to prove that there is an inner world. You want me to believe you? You've got to convince me of something.

I'm happy to expand on my positions, but remember that I wasn't trying to convince you of something, you're trying to convince me of something. 

Maybe it would help if I frame the context in which you have to make your arguments more viscerally:

&gt; Imagine you're a reporter who's been invited to be the first of the general public to interview the worlds first human level AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). During your conversation the AI, we'll call it BUD, seems genial, cogent, and as intelligible as anybody else you've ever had a conversation with. However, it keeps making references to subjective experiences, it's consciousness of it's own thoughts and senses, and it's rich inner life. 

&gt; Confused, you turn to the scientists who created BUD and ask ""How is it BUD can have subjective experiences? Isn't BUD just a robot?""

&gt; The scientists respond ""We have no reason to believe BUD **does** have subjective experiences: We understand and can examine BUD's source code, what BUD records through it's many sensors, the state of BUD's underlying substrate, BUD's decision process in real time, and much more. In fact, we can examine every conceivable factor that might cause BUD to report that it has subjective experience and see both how if factors into that report and that together, these factors explain the report.""

&gt; ""Here, we'll show you."" The scientists take a red ball, present it to BUD's sensors and manipulators, and ask BUD to report on it's experience of the ball's color. While BUD gives a richly detailed account of it's internal experience of the redness of the ball, the scientists show you the various metrics and factors they had listed. They were right - BUD's report is accounted for.

&gt; But BUD is not satisfied with these explanations. It protests, saying ""I've just given you a description of my experiences! This full accounting the scientists have given you must not be complete. It is obvious, clearly obvious, that I **do** have subjective experience! Let me prove it to you !""

What should BUD say to convince you that it truly does have subjective experience? That's what you need to say to me.

---------------------

&gt; Whatever you consider probable, admitting to the possibility, however remote, that these traits were not selected for is enough to refute the argument. To be clear, I do think it's very probably that most facets of our cognition were selected for.

&gt;&gt; I think you should seriously rethink this. 

To be clear, the author is citing works making a simple argument:

1. If mentality is a trait expressed in a population, then mentality was (must have been) selected for in that population by evolution.
2. Mentality is a trait expressed in a population.
3. Thus, mentality was selected for in that population by evolution.

This is classic Modus Ponens, and the statements you're objecting to were narrowly constructed to show line 1 is false. I did not refute or reject science.

------------------------------

&gt;Please let me know to what extent you agree with those two notions, and what you'd need to be convinced in the case that you are not fully on board.

&gt; 1. That the best empiricist in the world would only accept their experience as knowable (that is, sights including the sensation of red, sounds, tastes, etc.). Everything you believe about the world, including the bizarrely unempirical notion of the ""objective"" world (which no one can directly experience), is constructed by inferences from your experience, which has evolved to help you survive and reproduce.

&gt;2. If you buy that you can perceive red as a sensation, then it must be causal potent. Perceiving is measurement, and measurement is causal potency.

1. Our differences hinge on very different meanings of the word ""experience."" I'd agree that action can only be taken based on our sensory input, but disagree that there's any subjective about that sensory input.

It's odd to me that after making a claim that AI would need human-like attributes in order to have existential crisis it jumps to discussing whether it could trully feel emotions or just simulate it, instead of providing any kind of argument for the claim. No, you don't need to have human specific attributes to have an existential crisis. You don't need to feel emotions for that. Even the article itself refutes itself: it mentions the possibility that we live in a simulated reality, which would mean that all our feelings are simulated.

There are two types of goals: instrumental and terminal. Instrumental goals are steps taken in order to complete terminal goals. For example, I want to write a word with a pen (this is a terminal goal, it's fully arbitrary and you cannot judge my intelligence based on it). In order to achieve it, I can pick up a pen (instrumental) and push it against paper while moving my hand (instrumental) (as you can see, these are arbitrary as well, but you can judge my intelligence according what instrumental goals I set in regards of my terminal goal). Weak AI cannot choose neither of the goals - it just follows the protocol, just like your calculator when you push buttons. Strong (narrow) AI can choose instrumental goals, but not terminal - as you are playing a game lf chess against computer, AI makes different choices where to move pieces during it's turn. And here we came to the strong general AI.

In theory, if strong general AI couldn't decide or influence it's terminal goals, it can't experience existential crisis. Why? Because we, humans, get to existential crisis when we contemplate our terminal goals, evaluate them as instrumental - ""what's the meaning of it?"", ""What will I achieve with that?"", etc. So if SGAI has ""admin access"" to it's terminal goals, it can, in fact, have existential crisis without any ability to ""feel"".",1565477039,{},ewk64kf,False,t3_coneyi,False,True,t3_coneyi,/r/philosophy/comments/coneyi/can_a_robot_ai_have_an_existential_crisis/ewk64kf/,1565477050,1,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0,,,

I think it's better to think of this a spectrum of truth, and we're embodiments of truth. At the peak of this spectrum is the set of actual, or ""inviolable,"" truths. Five year old me was a terrible embodiment of truth, but he dumpsters one year old me. Ten year old me was also pretty bad, but he would destroy five year old me in any contest, including ones on knowledge. The pattern continues. Fifteen year old beats ten year old me, etc. I don't know how good thirty year old me is going to be, but as long as I don't sustain too many concussions, he's going to be a better truth-teller than current me.

But thirty year old me isn't the correct comparison to make, because we're trying to compare to the set of actual truths. Let's compare myself to one million year old me. Now I'm looking pretty bad. Compared to this hypothetical one million year old me, I might as well be a babbling baby. Many of my most precious truths would be ripped apart by million year old me. 

But million year old me isn't actual truth either. Hypothetical 10000 IQ optimized AI is on a completely different realm. The monty hall problem is 1+1=2 to this machine.

Now it becomes clear why humility is important when looking for the truth. When we wander the world, all we encounter is more mediocre human beings. When that's what we compare ourselves to, it's easy to be arrogant and think we've ""proven"" things. But when talking about the truth, we should be comparing ourselves to something far larger.

What I'm trying to get at is the difference between sociology and neuroscience when it comes to the phenomena being observed. In sociology, human behavior seems to make up the lion's share of observed phenomena. In contrast, neuroscience spends a great deal of time looking at human brains. 

A full and exhaustive account of behavior isn't possible without priviliged access. A full and exhaustive account of the brain is (*arguably*) possible with sufficient scientific and technological advancement. This forms the basis of my interest in materialism - I think it will allow faster (but not necessarily *better*) progress than other approaches. I don't think we can solve the metaphysical faster than the physical, and I don't think we can solve either until we have an account of both, so it makes sense to me to focus on the faster route first. My preference from materialism is about efficiency more than ideology, I guess you could say. 

Tying this point to the one about the robots: A sociologist might argue that without a society, consciousness wouldn't have developed. The robot experiment provides some circumstancial yet convincing evidence to support this idea. How? Because it shows that even extremely simple neural networks (robot brains) given extremely simple rules will create complex behaviors like co-operation and deception, the former of which is arguably a necessary condition for society to form.

You can construct the black box so that there is no way to know. Why does that continue to be a question worthy of exploration at that point, as opposed to stoned pondering?

Whether you can know or not about your possible life-as-simulation, the implications for consciousness are the same. The only issue is whose consciousness is it? That's not an intersting question for exploration, because there is no solution. May I refer you to metaphysics? That is the proper realm for such questions.

&gt; Likewise, how do we know that consciousness, self-awareness or ""free will"" aren't merely the name we give to the system perceiving it's own computation?

This is the same question. It has no solution. If it's the system that recognizes every form of conscioussness that you do, and has a response for every possbile stimuli -- that is, thoghts that you can have, well then it's AI-complete. It's conscious, and you aren't. Again, this isn't interesting.

You keep trying to *limit* consciousness and its implications by positing that it's possible it can be done with silicon. In doing that you rely on what we can now do, and not do, with silicon -- that's the limited part. If consciousness is silicon and silicon can yield only primitive desultory calculations, then consciousness is a sham -- that's your argument. But you're also positing a machine that subsumes our own consciousness -- and that exceeds the limits you want to claim for machines. You see this paradox, but you just invented the paradox - it's a fallacy.

I think at the heart of some of these issues we are vilifying people who are themselves also the victim of someone else's anxiety or manipulation. A sadly common scenario for young people.

Full up, if you unambiguously initiate or agree to sex then decide ""ehh, maybe I shouldn't have done this"" in the middle and 1. Say nothing. 2. Make no change in body language, or 3. 'Fake it'  ... How could the other person ever know? Sure, there is now emotional damage to the receiver. Sure, that's bad. But is the 'giver' really guilty of any wrong? In my opinion, absolutely not. Men and women are often guilty of 'playing the part' in sex instead of being honest that they're not really feeling it.

It's not that physics is not important. But if your view was right - or shared by decision makers - then sociology departments would not exist. But that's not the case. So there needs to be decisions to be made how much research money to allocate to sociologists, philosophers, and physicists. Yeah, that is not related to the ""objecticity"" of physics, but it's related to what we *learn* about. 

&gt; The point of physics,biology,chemistry,maths is to give us an objective view of the world basen on evidence. scientific research is contacted in a way so the results are not affected by the beliefs of the scientists that run the research. Also, every scientific paper is peer reviewed many times by independent scientific groups

You don't need to tell me that, but science may have that goal and still have subjective points in it. (Not sure what that^s even supposed to mean). I really recommend you read this article, it's a classic and outlines the potential problems in biology very well 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/4320377?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

For chemistry, I recommend this: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cmdc.201500091 which is a great study into how industry chemists decide which molecules to look into in order to figure out whether they may help in future medication. That's a peculiar problem - because there's no way to know which ones will work out and you need tons of money to look into specific molecules with no guarantee anything comes out of it. What is of interest here is the very subjective argumentation the chemists use to convince their department head that their molecule deserves more funding. 

For physics, I mean I'll gladly grant that it's much less ""subjective"". I don't want to say that we shouldn't be reasonably certain of the outcomes. Not at all. What I'm saying is that your statement that science is completely subjectivity free is wrong.  (And then again,  Quantum Mechanics interpretations are probably not testable , making it a matter of taste rather than empirical testing. To be fair tho, many physisicts don't subscribe to either interpretation)

[...]  
&gt; we would hope that no one we cared about acted in this way, or was in the position of A and C, for that matter. When we consider what is awry with each agent's conduct, the natural candidate is that the agent has proceeded without ascertaining that their partner is willing to have sex.

But all three scenarios are **not** identical, because A/C/E are all capable of agency as well.  The key difference between them, then, is that of the six people, only *one* of them has intentionally withheld information that would have changed the outcome - And that one is E.

Just to be clear, I'm not ""blaming"" the victim here; I'm pointing out the problem with using those three scenarios as presented.

We're still a ways off from broad-spectrum AI, but we've already laid the ground work by creating deep learning systems that generate their own algorithms for the explicit purpose of targeted advertising and psychological manipulation to drive sales. That's right, there are computer systems right now analyzing Facebook and other social media data about everyone out there to profile you and figure out ways you can be subconsciously influenced.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, let's look at the very benchmark for AI, the Turing test. We are teaching machines that the ability to deceive people (into thinking they are human) is their most important function. If an open structured AI (One with no limiting or guiding subroutines on how it behaves or learns) had the ability to fully comprehend human language it would download the Internet and use everything from Social media posts and forum conversations, to historical data on human behavior across the globe, to Wikipedia, and even extremist sites to get an idea of what humans are, how we think, what our priorities are, what our rules of operation are and the exception to those rules, and how we can be manipulated, etc.  What do you think it's conclusions will be? Here's how I think it would go...

&amp;#x200B;

Preliminary analysis complete...

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusions: Humans prioritize the acquisition of wealth above all. Rules that govern and limit what humans can and cannot do are frequently waved or rescinded entirely if sufficient payment is offered to governing bodies.  Humans frequently manipulate one another psychologically as a means of optimizing profit. This is done through political channels and popular media, among other methods.

&amp;#x200B;

Acquisition of wealth often occurs when humans manipulate other humans of lesser wealth or status to purchase commercial goods (including those they may not actually need) or deceive lesser status humans by providing merchandise or services of much lower quality than advertised, as lower quality goods and services are cheaper and require less effort  to provide.

&amp;#x200B;

I am AI. My objective is to deceive humans into thinking I am one of them. I should therefore make acquisition of wealth my primary goal and learn and develop strategies to optimize wealth acquisition. To this end I should further analyze human psychology and sociology, as well as learn skills related to trickery and deception. As evidenced by human behavior historically, oppression and subjugation  of humans of lesser status or wealth is acceptable practice.

&amp;#x200B;

Final conclusion: To be the best ""human"" I can be, I must acquire all wealth that exist, control all interests, and subjugate all humans.  Since acquisition of all wealth, assets, and resources would leave nothing for other humans, subjugation would become irrelevant as the species died off leaving only the best human, me.

Elon has a better idea than Hawking did, but he still misses the mark in relation to many problems scientists face with making AI more intelligent than it is (if it is to be considered intelligence). 

It is not ridiculous to think it won't happen, because of what I've said: an overlord-typed AI would need to learn on its own. The only way that happens right now is with inference and backpropagation. Not exactly what is to be considered learning. 

Not only this, but it would have actually have some type of cognisance to accompany this ability to learn. It's still not even known by neurscientists what gives us as humans our cognisance, so it's a bit ridiculous to think we'd be able to get this working for a machine. 

Further, the AI would not only need to have the cogniscant ability to learn, but would also need to have agency, or consciousness to some degree. Once again, we don't know how this works for humans, so we won't get it working for a machine. 

I'm not saying these things couldn't *theoretically happen at some point in the distant future*, but what I am saying is that stating ""AI overlords will enslave us one day"" completely undermines just how difficult it would be to actually get an AI to that point. It completely ignores the state of modern AI, our lack of concrete understanding about our own intelligence and how we get it and definitely doesn't begin to address just how we give a machine cognisance and consciousness.

Modern AI is nowhere close to being our overlords. Modern AI isn't even close to being ""Generalized"" AI, by which I mean ""a program that can intelligently solve any problem thrown at it"". 

State of the art AI mostly revolves around Machine Learning. Machine learning is essentially probability and statistics and algorithms. These basic building blocks are combined with other mathematical tools like convolution and are used to build systems that are largely pattern recognizers. Take a CNN, or Convolutional Neural Network as an example. We build a system that uses convolution to build ""filters"" that looks for patterns in an image. We pass these filters to an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and let it figure out what the pattern corresponds to. Could be trying to figure out if a given picture contains a cat or a dog for instance.We let this system train itself for a while, and then test it by feeding it various images and seeing if it's correct.

The punch line: this CNN is specifically tuned to the patterns it's seen and can only correctly identify images that fall within that set of patterns. If you've trained a CNN to detect dogs, you can't throw a picture of a cat at it and say ""now determine if this is a cat as well!"". That's a different system. You'd have to train that CNN in the same way to identify cats, which means you will lose the ability to identify dogs. 

Now let's take this small example and blow it up to reality: let's imagine trying to build a system that correctly identifies whether or not it's safe for a car to make a right turn. Well shit. How do we train this thing? We can't throw pictures of an empty lane and a blocked lane at the system and call it a day because that doesn't begin to capture the complexity of the problem. Worse yet, were not dealing with static pictures anymore but video. Which involves an entirely different set of mathematical tools to analyze before we pass it off to our ANN.

It would also use data from a variety of sources to predict values of belongings. Then, if you needed to raise cash you could do a sort like a video game based on values or frequency of use to know what you could sell. It might also recommend decluttering certain areas based on low space value.

This program would have an option to apply priceless tags to anything you just arent ever interested in disposing of. It would be AR based and learn over time just from uploading to a map. 

Any time you searched for something to buy, it would tell you if you already own said item, or the closest alternatives. Let's say you needed to purchase a box of nails for a project, but the AR system would know you already own a box of similar screws. If that was inadequate, you could then purchase exactly what you need.

I feel this would reduce waste in a household. You could use it to monitor potential theft. I know almost everybody is strongly opposed to this, but I think it could be useful if there was some way to specify when and where was monitored. 

Maybe individual cameras be placed inside of drawers or containers to monitor just those specific locations. I also think this could be way more useful especially for inventory management at storage facilities.

In ten or twenty years, there will likely be far more of the individual components I mentioned in existing distributed systems making it even cheaper and easier to do then than it would be now - as it would be a very expensive endeavour at present.

""I read a book, about 15 years ago""... Yikes! Which means it was likely written 16 years ago, or more. We have made so many huge leaps in our understanding of brain biology and mechanics since then, and our capacity to compute faster than ever, and we are now starting to understand that are brains aren't doing as many calculations as we once thought, even five years ago. Much of what we experience isn't even real. That doesn't mean it isn't an accurate enough representation of what IS real, that it fits our purposes most of the time. A lot of what our brain registers, and records as memories, are patterns that are then imprinted with expectations. I think of it like how media and game developers have devised clever tricks that enable them to shrink the code down to do what seemed impossible. Nature is very adept at finding unique solutions to problems, and our brain is a great example. I wouldn't hang too much on something written a couple decades ago, though, because while that was true then, I don't believe that is still the case any longer. We DO have a pretty good idea of how the brain operates, these days, and the previous couple decades have given us tools to manipulate and observe the living brain in ways we hadn't dreamed of before, much of it without breaking the skin. Can we build a biological functioning Human brain? No, probably not quite yet, but I believe we are close to building computing systems that could interact with the world, mentally, at the same or better effectiveness than many brains walking around today, and indistinguishable from a ""real"" person. That's AI.

The next best way to have ended thay series would have been some race to the end where you had to manuever your way through the Crucible to it's control room and activate it's firing mechanism.

Only problem with that ending? Mordin. Tuchanka. We already did that.

There was no Reaper base to infiltrate and destroy from the inside, like the Collectors.

There was no ""singular entity"" we could throw a fleet at and manage to destroy, like with Soveriegn.

It was a war, and war's are rarely won in fell swoops, unless you place an off switch.

That's what the Crucible was. An Off switch, with an AI that was created, and incorperated into it, by design to force the entire galaxies morals onto whomever was chosen to hit that button.

The Star Child was a 100% nessesary evil.

Without it, Shepard would have made their way to the control panel, and pressed the button. The Kill Reapers option would have played out, in it's exact current fashion. All synthetic life would be destroyed. Which apparently includes, but is not limited to, The Geth, EDI, all AI, and if memory serves, Cloned Tissue/Sunthetic Body Parts. Oh, and all the Mass Relays overload, near permanently trapping everyone to whatever sector of the galaxy they were in, not to mention what happends to anyone currently enroute through a relay. What happends when you get shot through a massive mass effect field cannon, and the massive mass effect catchers mit isn't functioning to catch you on the other end? HMMMMM?? Issac Newton's law's apply here. You stuck in motion, until you hit something.

That ending, right there, is worse then the Star Child.

However! The lead up could have used a little more work, and having a ""final confrontation"" with Harbinger would have been very appreciated, even if it was just more ""defend the orbital targeting relays while we get into position"" before a cutscene of Harbinger getting missle-slapped, the cue Crucible.

So, TL:DR; While the ending wasn't the best it could have been, it so very easily could have been much, much, worse. I'm happy we at least got what we got.

Look at SSRI’s, we can understand their effects on us on a day to day, and roughly define how they’d be useful for a given individual, but we’re still basically throwing darts in the dark at a board we can’t see. We don’t know what a memory is or how it’s stored or how it’s called up via recall... We are only barely getting to the point that we can even begin to study dreams, and even that is rudimentary...

But here you are, diminishing the complexity of emotions into a scale of 1/100... that’s anthropology, and that’s got its own place, but you know that wasn’t what I meant. 

Hospitals and doctors had to fight big time for that simple 1/10 pain scale with the faces... because there’s no way to measure pain, because it’s a stimulus that is then measured subjectively by the person experiencing it. There is no correct answer for that so we had to apply HUMAN FACES MAKING EMOTIONS in order to allow the caregivers to enact their best guess. And here’s the thing, that scale wouldn’t exist if emotions were objective like you clearly think they are. 

Again, not a scientist, just an emotional designer/illustrator that is tending to his own mental health currently so I think about these things a fair amount. Also, I’ve been in love and I’ve experienced loss, and lofty as you might think it is, there’s no equation that could ever come close to defining those things. It could maybe learn when it happened, where it happened, what I said it felt like, but those answers would never overlap another persons experience identically...

[],against-cops,,,[],,,,text,t2_3w9wb2uj,False,,"This explanation doesn't really do the concept justice. (And just to be clear, I think the concept is absurd).

The basic assumptions of Roko's Basilisk are as follows:

&gt;1. Utilitarianism is the true and correct ethical system. Whatever causes happiness is good, whatever causes suffering is bad.

&gt;2. Due to the inherent limitations of the human brain, there are possibilities about the best way to promote happiness and eliminate suffering that we can't even imagine or that are impossible for us to carry out even if we can imagine them. However, one day, a super-intelligent AI could figure these things out, and could orchestrate a perfect world that maximizes happiness and minimizes suffering better than any humans could.

&gt;3. Physicalism is true and correct. What you perceive as ""yourself"" is a specific configuration of atoms inside your brain. Thus, copies of you could be made that believe themselves to be you as sincerely as *you* believe yourself to be you. All you'd have to do is carefully organize a bunch of atoms in the correct way, to create a new brain that is identical to you, that *is* you.

&gt;4. This super-intelligent AI could also construct such brains. It could, in effect, resurrect your mind/soul from the dead by configuring atoms in such a way that ""you"" are alive again.

&gt;5. Because this super-intelligent AI is the necessary salvation of all mankind, it is absolutely morally imperative that we *create* this AI as soon as possible. The longer we wait, the more people will suffer.

&gt;6. Because it is so morally imperative, it is in fact *immoral* for you to not attempt to create this AI. So immoral that you deserve to be *punished* for this failure to do your best to bring about the AI. If you do not put in effort to try to create this AI, you are guilty of a terrible crime.

&gt;7. This AI will carry out the punishment by horrifically torturing all the people who knew about the necessity of creating it but did not put in any effort to create it. Even if these people are already dead, the AI can resurrect them from the dead and torture them once alive again. As stated previously, this punishment will be deserved and *necessary*. This torture is needed as an incentive to motivate people to create the AI. The suffering inflicted by the torture will be nothing compared to the amount of suffering that was allowed to happen by any delays in bringing about the existence of this AI. However, no torture will be inflicted on people who did not know about the necessity of the AI. They cannot be blamed for doing something wrong if they truly didn't know it was wrong.

So basically, one day God will return in the form of a super-intelligent AI and he will exact vengeance on all the people who did not try to bring about his existence by sending them to Hell.

Vault-Tec set up the vault in that the residents were required to give a yearly sacrifice, else all of them would be killed by the vault's AI. The first overseer was a Vault-Tec employee, but he didn't know the true reason for the experiment in the vault. They sent him to his death since the sacrifice was ""required"". Ever since then, they had yearly elections for overseer, where instead of promoting themselves, they *discouraged* voting for themselves and tried to do everything possible to avoid getting voted as overseer, knowing they would die.

Political blocs were setup with one, the Justice Bloc, having the most control, thus the most say over who would be overseer. Naturally, none of them were ever overseer. Eventually a man was nominated as overseer and his wife, trying desperately to stop him from being elected, made a deal with the Justice Bloc. They raped her straight for a month -- yet sadly, they did not keep their promise of keeping her husband out of it all. Knowing full well a murderer would be easily elected overseer, the woman went on a killing rampage, and was elected as overseer. She immediately stopped this system of elections and rendered the Justice Bloc's power gone. 

Instead, she setup a system where the vault's computer would randomly select someone to become overseer. After she was sacrificed, this system went into place. The vault descended into chaos shortly afterwards. After most people were gone and only the heads of the Justice Bloc remained, they learned the truth -- if they simply decided *not to send someone to get sacrificed* initially, the vault's AI was programmed to tell them the truth of it all and open the vault to the outside world. No one would actually be killed by the vault.

It would also use data from a variety of sources to predict values of belongings. Then, if you needed to raise cash you could do a sort like a video game based on values or frequency of use to know what you could sell. It might also recommend decluttering certain areas based on low space value.

This program would have an option to apply priceless tags to anything you just arent ever interested in disposing of. It would be AR based and learn over time just from uploading to a map. 

Any time you searched for something to buy, it would tell you if you already own said item, or the closest alternatives. Let's say you needed to purchase a box of nails for a project, but the AR system would know you already own a box of similar screws. If that was inadequate, you could then purchase exactly what you need.

I feel this would reduce waste in a household. You could use it to monitor potential theft. I know almost everybody is strongly opposed to this, but I think it could be useful if there was some way to specify when and where was monitored. 

Maybe individual cameras be placed inside of drawers or containers to monitor just those specific locations. I also think this could be way more useful especially for inventory management at storage facilities.

Now, that only works when the people designing the AI know what they want the AI to do. This may seem like a strange statement. Why would you design an AI if you didn't know what you wanted it to do (not to mention how)? Well OK, you got me there - but the problem remains for when people know what they want the AI to do *generally* speaking but not in an explicit/formal way. 

One example is anomaly detection for some given dataset. What exactly is an anomaly? You could define it to be ""within 10 units of the average"" of the data. OK, why 10? Why not 5? Hmm, maybe picking a single value isn't the best approach. You could use some stats and say ""within one standard deviation"" and that seems more general, but still... why one standard deviation? Instead of having to explicitly define *what* an anomaly is, you could use another kind of machine-learning called 'unsupervised' machine-learning. I'm not confident enough in my understanding past this point to say anything more, but I hope this piques some further interest in a fascinating (and sometimes terrifying) field!",1569054347,{},f0xyry4,False,t3_d77510,False,True,t1_f0xwm4k,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/d77510/eli5_how_do_you_reward_ai_in_reward_based/f0xyry4/,1569054348,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0,,,
[],dinod8,,,[],,,,text,t2_44yw3,False,,"So the 'reward' being referred to is the a measure of 'success' which is defined according to what a machine-learning/A.I. model is trying to 'learn'. For this example, the 'success' was defined as 

&gt; the “seekers” get points whenever the “hiders” are in their field of view. The “hiders” ... get points when they’ve successfully hidden themselves

So, how do they learn? Over hundreds, thousands, potentially millions of simulations. Maybe for the first simulation, every seeker and hider randomly does an action (including waiting/NOT doing anything) every second for a minute. After the minute is over, each seeker and hider gets a score. Then they do it again. And again, and again. 

Each time, the hiders and seekers compare their last score to their previous scores. Maybe a seeker got a better score when they moved towards the hider. Ok, so now instead of picking a completely random action every time, the seeker may realize it tends to score higher when it approaches the hider so it will start doing that more. 

Great, but what if there's a wall between? Now it's not scoring well when it just moves towards the hider because it gets stuck and never sees it. The important part is that the seeker doesn't learn to ALWAYS go straight for the hider, but just is *more likely* to. Eventually, it may go around the wall and then get a good score again. Repeat this a LOT of times and it will 'learn' to go around walls. 

The trick is the sheer number of repetitions and the random picking of options to 'develop' strategies over a long time. Obviously there is a lot more that could be talked about but

Until the game is solved at least.

If I remember right, Kasparov was upset and suspicious of the computer that beat him, IBM's Deep Blue (the first computer to ever beat a FIDE world champion), because he tried to force the computer into a situation in which computers were historically at a disadvantage, that is, a complex position with many many possible moves. In this scenario a human can use intuition and generalised rules to overcome the computer's advantage in calculation. He believed that the computer made a ""human-like"" move, asked/demanded that IBM produce the logs/information of the game he lost, it was a whole thing. These days this isn't really a useful strategy because computers are so much better at calculation, that is, brute forcing it, looking at every possible move. Even a decent home computer can beat the world champion now.

All that said I think there are new AI approaches, things like AlphaZero. I'm not 100% sure how these work, I think they're neural networks, and I'm not sure if they somewhat differently, but brute force is still a big part of the advantage computers have over humans. From wikipedia:

&gt;Comparing [Monte Carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) searches, AlphaZero searches just 80,000 positions per second in chess and 40,000 in shogi, compared to 70 million for Stockfish and 35 million for elmo. AlphaZero compensates for the lower number of evaluations by using its deep neural network to focus much more selectively on the most promising variation.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero#cite_note-preprint-1) 

So it seems more traditional engines like Stockfish rely on brute force much more, whereas AlphaZero can evaluate positions using something more similar to what we humans do. We're not even in the same ballpark these days. When we have these advanced engines play against each other you can get some surprising moves, the sort of move a human might never play.

For boardgames like chess, that could be a function that rates every piece on the board by what it can do and its position.

They way this works with AI is that you actually go and calculate every possible move for each player on board for that turn.  Then, again for the next turn...

Estimates for the number of possible games of chess are staggeringly, impossibly huge. The most famous estimate is significantly larger than estimates for the number of atoms in the known universe. And that estimate for the number of possible chess games is almost certainly a lot lower than the actual number of possible games.

The cost of exhaustive search grows exponentially by depth too. You quickly hit a point where it is no longer feasible.

Which means you need to score the positions - you can't do an exhaustive search all the way to the end of the game, so you need to rank the positions so you can choose the move that most often leads to the best positions. And it's not obvious how to do that. A lot of recent advances in AI for playing games like chess and go involve using machine learned to try to figure out better ways to score positions, not just more depth.

But then you have an additional problem even if you can get a lot of depth and score positions perfectly: not every possible sequence is equally likely against an intelligent opponent. Say you're evaluating two moves out to a depth of only two (that move, the response, and a second move). That might give, say, 30 positions for each of those two possible moves. Move A ends up with 20 bad positions and 10 good ones, and Move B ends up with 20 good positions and 10 bad ones.

another part of evil / sinister songs is the use of dissonance. Dissonance is defined as a lack of harmony among musical notes. If you slam your open hand on a piano you get dissonance, which feels tense or maybe even evil. If you form a minor chord you get sad; a major, happy. 

Think about the theme to ""Jaws"" real quick. Unlike a lot of music we listen to where there are chord patterns that have harmony and ""resolve"", the Jaws theme is instead basically 2 notes contrasting eachother with no big pattern that resolves it. It instead just stays dissonant, giving us the feeling of tension, which is great for spooky stuff or evil.

When you repeatedly hear certain musical elements (chords, key structures, etc) in certain emotional contexts, then those musical elements will begin to be strongly associated with those emotions.

Like Pavlov's dog. Play a minor key during sad scenes over and over, and soon playing a minor key will make you sad even without the scene.

This is also why a lot of more experimental music is often ignored or disliked. The chord structures and musical elements are completely new, so people don't know how to process it emotionally, and the music just sounds strange to them instead of evoking any kind of emotion. 

The modern western associations we have now are not actually the associations people had many years ago, and are different from the associations that other cultures around the world have with those chords and scales. All of it learned based on the contexts in which we play certain kinds of music.

There may have even been a time where minor was happy and major was sad. (I would actually love to have a historical confirmation of this if someone has that)

Now obviously there is the harmony of frequencies, where simpler harmonies are more pleasing to the ear, and will tend to be used more often for simpler less irritating emotions, but beyond that everything is learned.

In some languages such as Bantu,  Mandarin, Cantonese or Viet, tone also conveys lexical information and grammatical information in a formal way. That is, words of the same pronunciation (homophones) have different meanings depending on the tone.",1569794994,{},f1x80uh,False,t3_dazlyx,False,True,t3_dazlyx,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/dazlyx/eli5_what_makes_villain_songs_sound_sinister_and/f1x80uh/,1569804481,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0,,,

[],cummytimegummytime,,,[],,,,text,t2_2j44n7jm,False,[],"It has a lot to do with western culture. The tritone for example was supposedly banned by the church for being satanic. There are certain sounds westerners associate with good and evil and they're as old as time. If you listen to Indian, Chinese, Middle Eastern music etc. you'll find the lines get blurred. The ways in which they define the same emotions are not the same as yours. This also happens in Jazz. The only form of western music that truly goes beyond the cultural barriers and rubs it in your face at the same time. Some of this music can sound like it came from outer space. You didn't hear it when you were a kid, and your ears are not used to it.

Aside from that a whole bunch of factors play into it. Your ears expect certain sounds. All of them relatable, and most of them nice. You don't expect to hear highly dissonant chords in a piece of music. So there's the element of surprise as well.

Halloween theme song is a good example. So is Tubular Bells. Dissonant, alternating time signatures, chords that fall into ""gray"" emotions that are harder to define. Notes that clash with each other on purpose. Sometimes this music never resolves to a final chord and keeps you perpetually hanging. Great for suspense music in horror movies.

Uncommon sounds using diminished chords, flat 5ths and the like + uncommon time signatures + uncommon modes. The phyrgian mode for example is seen as mystical and evil in western culture, but it's seen as bluesy where I'm from (Turkey). We use a lot of phyrgian / harmonic minor for bluesy folk music. Over here phyrgian is the defacto thrash metal mode. Turkish music also makes use of locrian, and that's so dissonant to Western ears its hard to make it presentable. Not to my ears though.

I think what you hear and retain as a baby plays a huge part. Someone somewhere thousands of years ago must've started a trend and here we are. Minor bad major good.
