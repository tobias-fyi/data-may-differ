Essentially the blind, deaf, and people missing limbs will create demand and iteration. There's a common misconception that regular people would jump into this new technology, but it'll take time.

Once the technology advances we might find that replacement eyes offer a wider range of vision and options. Stuff like integrated optical zoom, wider visual spectrum, etc might outweigh any advantages biological eyes have. This is the same for mechanical limbs as well. I digress since this has been discussed for decades.

Assuming the technology works and is reproducible it's really just a matter of time. The number of connections in the interface will start out low, but they'll advance to systems with a million or more I/O neural connections. The neat thing is in theory you don't need to remove body parts for these systems to function necessarily. The brain is able to rewire and you could add an extra arm or camera in theory or switch between systems.

In VR/AR there's a focus on better displays and eye tracking sensors and various other systems. It's basically a given that with an advanced neural interface we'll see that as the optimal system. This will cover a wide range of applications where video feeds are present. Controlling a first person drone with a standardized protocol might be a lot more intuitive later since you wouldn't need a display or controller.

I'm sure I'm getting downvoted for not slurping this bullshit up but I will offer actual rhetorical tools that could be used in good faith but they aren't gonna work if this whole chicken little shtick doesn't take a back seat.

Most people have no clue that the mercury in fish comes from burning coal, it's in the smoke from coal plants and it ends up in bodies of water, mercury has a marked influence on the onset of mental illness and can damage IQ and social development in children and has a plethora of known effects on pregnant women, the antivax movement(Bipartisan but mostly liberal) is largely about mercury being in some vaccines. Remember conservatives were all for and are all for pulling lead out of products because it lowers IQ which seems to cause violence/crime rates to be higher. the next IQ related Key to convincing conservatives to care about carbon sinks is in oxygen/CO2 content in relation to IQ, it stands to reason preventing he IQ decline is a good goal but if you want to motivate conservatives I think you'll get a lot of traction by suggesting we increase the atmospheric oxygen supply for Health and IQ benefits.

This cricket burger and lab beef stuff turns off regular folk immensely and vegetarian and vegan lifestyles have large opposition you will never surmount. I know the climate activists talk about methane like it will be the end of the world but it reacts in the upper atmosphere and breaks down into CO2 and water the cycle is suspected to be about 9 years and is dependent on the content of hydroxyl radicals, it's complicated you can look at the wiki but effectively we could isolate OH and release it at the layer of our atmosphere where most Methane settles and solve that problem or it's done as a byproduct of restoring deforested land by producing rain which creates new OH. Another obvious partial solution is capturing methane from/near the source, methane isn't the cleanest burning but it is a readily available fuel source we are wastefully ignoring. I suspect most people would support subsidies for efficient methane collection methods to be installed on pig farms at the very least.

The next thing is ending desertification and developing de-desertification strategies and resources which can be employed on large and small scales cheaply and efficiently, I'm all for conserving some ranges of desert but most of it is useless and wasteful, for the rest of the life on the planet so pursuing de-desertification efforts could yield arable/developable; grassland with cows on it is better than sand.  

The primary thing is restoring old growth forests and returning vast sections of unused plains land back into forests and jungles, we need an efficient method for doing this, this idea of sapling bombing ain't so bad but I'm sure fair bits of this can be done with seed/seedbombing, mass produced ""seed brittle"" would be about as harmful as hail and would probably be successful at starting a reforestation effort no need for all of the complex tooling and manual labor in making sapling bombs or in manually digging and planting at all.

The next major effort should be in the oceans, various kelps and other plant life do seed and grow from rhizome material, all that is required is extremely densely packed dirt around some viable seed and rhizome and attaching seed droppers to shipping vessels. If it's dense enough to sink and not be wholly digested by stupid fish then it should sink to the bottom and begin growing.

If we can engineer corn we can engineer ocean plants, and we probably should.

Support for these things with subsidies and tax breaks would be far more popular than taxing people for using carbon resources, it all really comes back to the carrot and the stick, people aren't going to accept the stick or a yoke so the best you can do is lead them with carrots 

Language matters, ""Save the coral reef"" is a lot less compelling than ""restore the Coral reef"" how? well it's back to coal effecting the PH of our water cycle acid rain essentially. ""Restore"" implies and urgent sense of loss, ""save"" implies urgency but it's been the slogan for over 30 years and it still needs saving? either the people saving it are ineffective or it has just never gotten worse, ""save"" Implies it's either imminently fucked and we can't do much or that it ain't fucked yet.

Most conservatives in america Identify as Christian, remind them what the bible says about conservationism: Genesis 1:28: ""And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."" the bible goes on at length about treating animals well and protecting and using all things in nature, it's no surprise modern conservationism was born out of christian nations in the first place.

We're back to rhetoric because that was a simple appeal to the people I see climate activists refusing to appeal to and I'm sure half of reddit has their panties up in their sigmoid colon after reading that, it's that simple, almost nobody in the activist community has been respectful, constructive, or positive on the environmentalist front in america for over 40 years, that fact along with upon hostility, threats, shame tactics and other rhetorical failings but also needless political squandering of political capital(good faith/trust, willingness of the public to listen) by pushing bunk and and bad data; an inconvenient truth declared we would have a new coast line 50-100 miles inland because of sea level rise by 2013, well I'm sorry but not even democrats seem to buy that bunk anymore considering the Obama's just bought a beach front mansion this year.

If you don't think the failures of environmentalism are largely rhetorical then what is ""global warming""? ""Global warming"" was a half-baked, alarmist, trendy name for climate change and it's tanked the credibility of climatologists who supported ""global warming"" in the eyes of laymen(unduly harmed the credibility of everything adjacent to it, people and ideas), this is half of the reason mass distrust of science is birthing a new Luddite/anti-science movement irrespective of politics.

People have been making guns in their garages for years, out of good old steel, much more durable than 3D printed plastic.  The only difference is, that took some skill and experience.

I’m of the opinion that access is the problem.  Within reason, we should not be limiting what guns people can get.

This is in response to the general spirit of most of the comments that I’ve read:

Facial recognition wouldn’t supplant constitutional protections of privacy or free speech. There really is no element of the government that is actually interested in putting strict restrictions on public discourse or opinion, or spying on you, or otherwise oppressing you. If something like that were to happen, that’s what the courts are for. Maybe we’ll see a case go through soon where they’ll say that you need a warrant to conduct a facial recognition scan or something of the like. 

Basically, 90% of these comments are just fearmongering. Considering that this sub is about new technologies and the future, I’m honestly surprised that so many people suddenly morph into Luddites simply because of an ill-informed suspicion of government and law enforcement authorities. Historically, nearly all technological advancements have resulted in a net benefit to humanity. Almost all technologies can be used for good or ill, depending on who is using said technology. The same technology facilitated the V-2 rocket (bad) and the moon landings (very good). Facial recognition can either facilitate a digital police-state dystopia (i.e. China), or it can be used within existing legal and constitutional frameworks to create a safer and fairer society. 

Imagining the extreme uses of any emerging technology, be it facial recognition/legal algorithms (Minority Report), AI(pretty much every “TEH ROBOTZ AR TAKING OVER” flick ever made), robotics (“The robots are taking our jobs! The end is nigh!”), or genetics (Jurassic Park), can skew our popular perception of technological advancements to the point that we ignore the benefits that they bring. Rather than cite the flaws of facial recognition or courtroom algorithms as reasons for their invalidity, we should look for ways to resolve those issues improve those technologies. Algorithms hold a great deal of promise in the future. Don’t discard them because they’re imperfect at an early stage of development, give them time to improve.

Yang is not for open borders. He's for strong border enforcement and traditional immigration policies that motivate smart people to move here, legally, to benefit our economy. 

He also wants rational gun control. He doesn't want to take people's guns. He wants legislation to keep people with mental health issues from buying, wants to subsidize people modifying existing guns with tech that only lets owners fire them (not kids or people who steal them), and he wants an always available buy back program for assault rifles to decrease the overall number if people choose to take cash instead. None of that is ""take our guns"" and you can still protect your home with your shotgun and hand guns, if you want some extra cash for the AR-15.

Say you live until 100 and start consuming entertainment from 10 years old. That's 32,850 days with which to consume media. This is ignoring that people have work and education taking up a lot of time. Entertainment takes the form of books, movies, TV shows, vacation, live events, music, board games, etc. There are a lot of hobbies and ways people can spend their time. Sure if you only partake one source of entertainment you might get bored. It's fascinating to think that one could literally watch a new movie every day of their life and not finish them. (There are over 500K movies on imdb alone, then again not all need to be watched). This idea of consuming a single source of entertainment was relegated to books for a long time. The list of ""classic movies"" will grow and grow. Some might fall off the list, and others will take their place.

There's also a rise of new forms of entertainment. Currently VR is growing slowly with new unique experiences. I've shown this to a number of people and gotten comments similar to ""what a time to be alive"" which really captures the idea. In probably 10 years we'll have AR experiences becoming common place. Mixed reality opens up a lot of avenues for creators to make new experiences.

&gt; Maybe AI could help with this in the future, introduce us humans to new pleasurable experiences we haven't thought of before.

The idea of tailored TV shows that run forever has been dreamed of for a long time. Given the success of soap operas these will probably be very popular. I know I could probably watch new episodes of Stargate SG-1 for a long time without getting bored.

Though I wonder how on Earth Democrats doing the above mean they lose when Trump attacks anyone who is critical of him even labeling the media the enemy of the people (freedom of press?), wanting to stifle criticism of the Right to the point of wanting to censor the internet (freedom of speech), continually attacks and insult those he doesn't agree with, lies continually and is always caught, flirts with racism and extreme policies like extending term limits, getting do over time, and pushing conspiracy theories which hold zero water. This is on top of wasting millions in taxpayer money, denying science, pushing a damaging trade war, and more.

But Democrats pushing to combat Climate Change, gun control in a time where mass shootings are at all time highs, and returning checks and balances to a system overrun with corruption.

[],Sirisian,,,[],,,,text,t2_5hqm0,False,,"&gt; Why not?

Mechanical controls generally require that every switch, warning, and action be given space in a layout. In many systems a lot of them are only there to control rarely used systems or are used to correct warnings. Each dial and switch (some with LEDs) inside of them represent potential point of failures. They also have wires which add weight and complexity.

Digital and AR HUDs are able to interface with systems in customizable ways. More specifically they can be context aware to situations and things like voice. If a warning happens you see the warning. There isn't just a beeping and a LED lit up someplace. Since AR is context aware you can see what needs to be done, but also the system shows you minimally the options you have. In a mechanical setup this might be the options around the warning, but you might need other knobs which all relies on training to be good.

I realize an AR system might not be ideal for the military since it is itself a point of failure. That said in theory it can be connected with a wire or very localized LiFi for security.

AR systems also scale and upgrade easily with new hardware. Retrofitting mechanical systems is a lot of work and custom one-off fabrication whereas digital and AR are software which is more easily modified.

An advanced AR system could also let you control the ship in 3rd person with enough cameras, essentially a VR view independent of the view through the windows.

They're not really consumer devices, but it's kind of telling the hardware costs which are beyond even a lot of early adopters. Even Nreal is $500 dollars for just the glasses and requires a compatible USB-C smartphone which brings the price to over 1.1K.

Speaking of iPhone, Apple has reportedly stumbled with their AR headset. The hardware and software are much harder than it first appears and ""good enough"" is out of the reach of many companies still. (It was rumored they were/are using 8K per eye displays using their MicroLED R&amp;D). Like I said the low-latency hand tracking alone to be ""good enough"" still isn't part of say Hololens 2 or Magic Leap. These are like basic things that users might expect when interacting with a UI. (Being able to put your hands in front of a virtual box or display with proper occlusion).

The other part of AR is also wireless connectivity. Many companies view 5G as the interface for a future AR headset. It offers low-latency high bandwidth connections for streaming content. The rollout of cheap 5G is still limited to a few areas and only a few smartphones have it. It's another piece of the puzzle that'll make AR go mainstream with applications that can really offer novel experiences.

Also you mention cost, but if we can get AR displays at 16K+ per eye we'll pass what is known as monitor/TV replacement. 16K / 180 degrees is around 90 pixels per degree.

Treadmills done right or galvanic vestibular stimulation would solve the issue. Perhaps not for every single form of movement, but as it turns out a lot of movement off-ground is already immersive and low-sickness inducing when done right. (climbing, flying, swimming, zero gravity)

Most VR games do not rely on teleportation. That was the case 2 years ago, but that mindset changed.

&gt; You cannot prevent people from clipping through walls. 

Of course you can. Today you just exert an equal opposing force when someone physically walks through a virtual wall. It feels fine and stops clipping. Your virtual body can also be a full physics object stopping any clipping of the limbs as well - same with weapons.

&gt; ""Omnidirectional treadmills"" (such as they are), despite being astronomically expensive, still suck and aren't at all convincing.

The Infinadeck is promising in the long-term with better engineering design and either BCIs to read intent or eye tracking+body tracking to infer how the player is moving their limbs to respond fast enough.

 &gt; The whole thing is a joke of clunky, under cooked mechanics.

The clunkyness is being fixed. [These are real protoype headsets](https://roadtovrlive-5ea0.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oculus-rift-prototype-half-dome-2-3-640x295.jpg) and the one on the right is close to a Ready Player One style HMD. None of those cause any headaches or eye-strain and would be healthier on the eyes than any normal display because your eyes would always be shifting focus as they do in real life. Beyond these prototypes, waveguides are known to be the long-term solution for the ultra thin Ready Player One visor.

&gt; Despite being worked on by people who are very smart and full of ideas, the cumulative effect is an enormous yawn.

Oh wow, you mean this incredibly complex technology field hasn't been solved in just a few years after the first serious R&amp;D teams started? How long PCs took to fix their issues and go mainstream? 20 years or so.

&gt; That's also why VR development has slowed way, way down.

No it hasn't. There are more HMDs releasing now than ever and hiring continues to stay steady and often increases more each year. The software is also getting higher budget as well.

&gt; This is like the VR craze of the 90s, and will end similarly. 

Hah, no. Only 4 or 5 companies released a consumer headset in the 90s, and they were startups or tiny companies. No billion dollar corporation bothered to release a product. Serious R&amp;D was not happening and investment was next to nothing. Today that's the opposite; billions invested by many billion dollar corportations, most of which are staying the course.

&gt; You also do not understand the difference between AM and FM. 

I don't think you realize the fact that various people already thought the Oculus Quest was impossible to engineer, or that there's no way to do highly realistic facial tracking with a headset design [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3XcQtoja_Y). Many people (seemingly you too) think something requires magic. Turns out, nope. Things can be solved. (with respect to VR)

&gt; Sure, you can choose to replace all of your screens with VR, but the tradeoffs are not worth it, will probably never be worth it.

Explain. With a HMD say a decade from now, you'll get this:

- As many crisp screens as you want. Any size you want. You could recreate an million dollar IMAX theater down to a tee, including the surround sound audio thanks to audio propagation and personal HRTFs.

- Higher productivity due to being able to filter out distractions.

- Best collaborative environment as people can jump in to a space as avatars and share designs, screens, environments, you name it.

- Portable. Can put screens anywhere you want in the house, whether that's a real or virtual house. Screens can follow you around in a personal bubble, you can take them on the bus, etc. (Obviously you have AR functionality)

The only two tradeoffs are wearing something which eventually will just be a pair of glasses as well as other people around you requiring glasses to see the same content.

You will never be able to move about in a convincing way. A great number of VR games rely on teleportation or being on rails because of this. There is no solution to this problem in the works.

You cannot prevent people from clipping through walls. ""Omnidirectional treadmills"" (such as they are), despite being astronomically expensive, still suck and aren't at all convincing. Motion sickness isn't a problem that is even close to being solved. These are just things I've noticed personally from my trade show reporting. There are a myriad of problems pointed out by people far smarter than I, but this is my street-level assessment. It's all breathless nerds and empty promises.

That's also why VR development has slowed way, way down. This is like the VR craze of the 90s, and will end similarly. Yes, it's better than it was at the time, but not significantly so. The industry has shelved all of these problems, waving their hands with a ""future technology will solve this"" attitude. You know, the same excuse we're using not to address climate change. Techno-futurists are as deluded as ever. Consumers have never understood the AM/FM distinction (Actual Machines / Fucking Magic), and oddly, neither do some engineers. It's no wonder Elon Musk is so popular. People love pie-in-the-sky promises by do-nothing hucksters that will never, ever be fulfilled.

It is constantly improving and learning, too, so at some point simpler deepfakes will be virtually indistinguishable.

No one in the public knew he was racist until he got angry at his mistress for associating with black people. Now, you don't know Sterling that well (or, more accurately, you ""know"" him) so your defense would have made him innocent before that audio leaked according to your logic.

[],ResilientBiscuit,,,[],,,,text,t2_798l8,False,,"&gt; That's a good argument against gun control.

You need to figure out the balance with gun control. If you look at something like the AR you get these shootings where 20 people get killed. Pistol grip, semi-automatic rifles with quick release magazines can engage targets way faster than pretty much any other gun out there.

But banning them would be incredibly dumb. The bullets break up much better when they hit walls and it is far easier to for someone who wants to defend their home to keep control of them.

Contrast that with handguns which are involved in 7,000+ homicides annually.

I don't think there is any reasonable argument to be made against banning semi-automatic pistol grip rifles. But honestly I would feel safer if we generally got rid of concealed carry and made hand guns much harder to acquire.

Now, all of that aside.

&gt; Maybe it's correct, but I don't think we should just let bad apples go.

I am not sure I agree. If, in general, we rethought our immigration practices to be much more humane, transpired and expeditious, you would start to see cooperation from sanctuary cities. It could get to the point where we actually would see violent offenders get deported.

But ICE has such a bad rap for trying to deport the good, upstanding EMT who has no memory of ever being in another country because he was here since his parents brought him here when he was 2 months old.

The only way they are going to do that is to prove that they care about people more than they care about enforcing the law. And that is going to mean treating them like we treat citizens in our country.

When there is harm that could potentially be caused to good individuals by going after bad, we error pretty far on the side of do no harm.

Until that starts happening, we are never going to see the cooperation needed for ICE to be effective.",1569038945,{},f0xnptc,False,t3_d71hhk,False,True,t1_f0xn0un,/r/technology/comments/d71hhk/everyone_should_have_a_moral_code_says_developer/f0xnptc/,1569038945.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],splynncryth,,,[],,,,text,t2_34fcq,False,,"Decades of headlines about things like graphene, carbon nanotubes, cues for cancer, etc have created at least one generation of cynics who see a headline like this and see either marketing, or outright falsehoods.

Let me try and break down this article. 

Using algae to scrub CO2 is not a new concept. The [wikipedia article on algae bioreactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae_bioreactor) shows the idea of cultivating algae with CO2 as an input to the process has been experimented with for a while.  I don't remember when I first saw the concept for an algae based CO2 scrubber on TV, but I can find a [reference to something from 2008](http://geo-engineering.blogspot.com/2008/10/removing-carbon-from-air-discovery.html) that discusses using algae for CO2 scrubbing.  
I seem to remember seeing something earlier than that. But things more than a few years old tend to run together in my memory and get labeled as just The Past :( I think the show was called Beyond 2000 or something like that. 

So, this article is about an established concept that we have not seen commercially. There is probably a good reason why such as energy use, cost, efficiency, or something else that prevents it from being commercially viable. With that in mind, lets see if there is anything in the article to address these challenges. 

&gt; By pairing it with a machine learning system...

Oh... ML. But curiously, there is no mention of how they applying ML, the types of DNNs they are using, or even what problems they are using ML to solve. 
There are the barest of hints at what they **might** be doing.
&gt; The machine monitors factors like light, available carbon dioxide, temperature and more to maximize the amount sequestered by the algae.

But standard industrial controls can be used to control these inputs. So what does ML bring to the table? I don't see anything in the article. Nor do they even hint at what ML model might be in use.

It really sounds like ML is being used in place of AI to avoid appearing like outright BS. AI is something of a tech bubble right now. Like the dot com era, people are attaching AI to everything in the same way people attached Internet to things back in the 90s. 

The article does mention a prototype, but why don't we have any pictures of it? I'd like some evidence that this is more than just vaproware (insert CO2 jokes here). 

Something else in the article that made me skeptical is this:
&gt;It’s not the only ambitious idea in the works at the six-division Hypergiant Industries. Its Galactic division is aiming to build a multi-planetary internet by using satellites as relays.

That entire paragraph seems to be trying to borrow credibility from other companies and individuals. 
The satellite relay project seems to be trying to borrow credibility from StarLink. Their ""Ironman"" idea looks to draw from AR projects like Hololens. 
The people they mention lack the expertise in fields relevant to the biology, aerospace, or computer vision areas for the bioreactor, satellite, or AR projects they mention. 
In short, it all sounds like marketing hype and my BS meter is pretty much pegged at this point. 

But lets try and remain optimistic and dig into the company a little more.

Lets take a look at Hypergiant CEO [Ben Lamm's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benlamm/) LinkedIn profile. 
[Simply Interactive](https://www.linkedin.com/company/simply-interactive/about/) looks like it went for 6 years before being sold.
[Chaotic Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaotic_Moon_Studios) ran for 5 before being sold.
[Team Chaos](https://www.linkedin.com/company/team-chaos-llc/about/) was 4 years old when it was sold. It's nopt clear if Lamm was helping run this company while also working at Chaotic Moon Studios.
[Conversable](https://www.linkedin.com/company/conversable/about/) was 3 years old before being sold. 

The employees [shown by LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hypergiant/people/) resemble a software as a service company. I don't see any of the other disciplines in engineering that would be required to pull off a viable algae bioreactor. 

Algae bioreactors aren't BS, thought he numbers Hypergiant is touting probably are. 
Some more info about the challenges of algae bioreactors can be found in [this National Center for Biotechnology Information paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836383/). 

TL;DR While algae bioreactors do exist, the vague claims and use of hype words in this article are suspect. Furthermore, Hypergiant looks like it is a company engineered to create hype (so the name is fitting). The employee info available on LinkedIn looks more like a SaaS company rather than a bio engineering one. Also, the CEO seems like someone who adheres to the Eric Cartman 4 point business plan from his history in his LinkedIn profile.

Listen, you fantastically retarded motherfucker. I’m going to try to explain this so that you can understand it.
You cannot control an entire country and its people with tanks, jets, battleships and drones or any of these things that you so stupidly believe trumps citizen ownership of firearms. 
A fighter jet, tank, drone, battleship or whatever cannot stand on street corners. And enforce “no assembly” edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3AM and search your house for contraband. 
None of these things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation. Those weapons are for decimating, flattening and glassing large areas and many people at once and fighting other state militaries. The government does not want to kill all of its people and blow up its own infrastructure. These are the very things they need to be tyrannical assholes in the first place. If they decided to turn everything outside of Washington D.C. into glowing green glass they would be the absolute rulers of a big, worthless, radioactive pile of shit. 
Police are needed to maintain a police state, boots on the ground. And no matter how many police you have on the ground they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians which is why in a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while the people have nothing but their limp dicks.
BUT when every random pedestrian could have a Glock in their waistband and every random homeowner an AR-15 all of that goes out the fucking window because now the police are out numbered and face the reality of bullets coming back at them.

[],happyscrappy,,,[],,,,text,t2_3dg76,False,[],"&gt; From this conversation I'm beginning to suspect you struggle with the basics of rocket design. I'm trying to help with that, but theres only so much I can say here, pick up a copy of Rocket Propulsion Elements

I don't, thanks. The idea of rocket propulsion is to throw mass out the back rapidly (mv^2 ) to push the rest of the rocket forward. It's why Xenon is used in electric drives for example. And there is a small push to more massive fuels for chemical rockets by some members of the community recently for the same reasons.

[edit: I used methane before. Fixed it.] Methanol's molar mass is only half that of UDMH anyway. And both combustions will incorporate oxygen so I can't see how the combustion products would be higher. So I don't find your answer to be at all explanatory. Do you actually not know the answer? If so, just say so. It's not like you owe me an answer, I just have no use for a wrong one.

If you want to discuss rocketry, get off your high horse and we can discuss it.

&gt;  Standardization matters only at low flightrates ... with several subvariants

We haven't heard of dozens of variants yet. And I also expect that there will be an advantage to one even larger than the largest variant. There always is. And that's why I don't expect any rocket ever to fly will all return to launch pad. Because it doesn't make sense to make a one off design for that one extra large payload.

It would have been real easy for you to say ""yep, I see that"". But instead no, you just go elliptical.

&gt; Implicit in your question was the assumption that a nontrivial number of such payloads need to be launched. If its only 1 or 2 a year out of hundreds of thousands of flights, then its easier for all involved to just land downrange and charge the customer a boatload of money for the inconvenience.

Which is what I said. Thanks. You had to quibble with my comment just to then agree with it. Bizarre.

You mean the chart which also lists per capita CO2 output? I don’t think that is nearly the slam dunk argument you think it is.

&gt;I disagree with the reference’s assessment, b/c it allows the EU to break itself up into parts. If that’s the case, then the US should also be fragmented to avoid counting its actual emissions. 

So you want these to be broken up by countries, yet not when it comes to America because that’s unfair to us because *reasons*? Way to be flagrant with your hypocrisy, my dude.

I 100% agree, I’m just not sure what that has to do with me since I haven’t called you any names.

Cool.

&gt;Americans don’t have a choice. Rich people have prevented reasonable public transportation for over 100 years. 

I guess I hold myself and other Americans more responsible for their lack of action here than you, but that’s just me.

Because we are purchasing the products they produce without putting enough social or legislative pressure to prevent widespread environmental damage.

From this conversation I'm beginning to suspect you struggle with the basics of rocket design. I'm trying to help with that, but theres only so much I can say here, pick up a copy of Rocket Propulsion Elements 

&gt;Haha. You get done telling me how valuable standardization is and now you say to just build a oneoff to save money! You aren't actually making any sense

1. Standardization matters only at low flightrates. Expendable rockets fly a couple times a year each, its obviously a problem if each is a unique configuration. If each individual variant flies thousands of times a year, then specialization makes sense. I expect dozens of variations of Starship, with different vehicle sizes and payload bay configurations, the same way there are dozens of different passenger aircraft each with several subvariants

2. Implicit in your question was the assumption that a nontrivial number of such payloads need to be launched. If its only 1 or 2 a year out of hundreds of thousands of flights, then its easier for all involved to just land downrange and charge the customer a boatload of money for the inconvenience. But if more than a couple percent of launches require that (or worse, if they require expendability ever), you've sized for the wrong market, and need to build bigger. Whether that means building a specialized variant thats big enough, or moving the entire fleet to a larger class, will depend on market trends and on how flexible the baseline vehicle is

&gt;Having only two stages certainly is a help. It's never made any sense from a rocket equation standpoint before. But maybe it's time now?

F9 is also 2 stages. But F9 S2 is like 20% the mass of the whole stack, vs more like 30% for Starship.

Abstract

Neanderthals are among the best studied and yet most enigmatic fossil human groups with aspects of their anatomy and functional morphology remaining poorly understood. We present the first anatomical reconstruction of the Neanderthal cartilaginous Eustachian tube (CET), a vital component of the upper respiratory tract and nexus for the middle ear and postnasal airway. The Eustachian (auditory, pharyngotympanic) tube, comprised of a bony and cartilaginous (CET) portion, is integral to normal physiological functions such as middle ear aeration and pressure equilibration. Findings indicate that Neanderthal tubal morphology may have predisposed them to high rates of middle ear disease (otitis media, OM). In living humans, mechanical CET dysfunction underlies OM in infants and young children, with sequelae including hearing loss, meningitis, and pneumonia. Despite proven linkage of CET malfunction with OM, the role of CET morphology in Neanderthal health and disease remains unstudied. We reconstructed Neanderthal CET morphology, comparing their crania to a modern human growth series. Methods included geometric morphometrics (GM) and univariate measures among Procrustes‐fitted coordinates. Results showed Neanderthal adults exhibiting primitively tall and narrow nasopharynges with infant‐like horizontal CET and choanal orientation. As horizontal CET orientation is associated with increased OM incidence in infants and children until around age six, its appearance in Neanderthal adults strongly indicates persistence of high OM susceptibility at this time. This could have compromised fitness and disease load relative to sympatric modern humans, affecting Neanderthals' ability to compete within their ecological niche, and potentially contributing to their rapid extinction.",1568898288,{},f0s3oez,True,t3_d6dqay,False,True,t3_d6dqay,/r/science/comments/d6dqay/a_common_childhood_illness_chronic_ear_infections/f0s3oez/,1568898299.0,1,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potassium is highly reactive so it never occurs in a native state on earth, so it’s always ‘bound’ in a chemical compound.

Argon is an inert gas at STP meaning that it’s easy to diffuse out of permeable matrixes.

Assume a lava-flow eons ago. There is potassium chemically bound in the lava whereas the argon is essentially driven out of the molten material by the heat. When the lava cools we have a pristine, non-permeable material with some chemically immobilized potassium and essentially zero argon.

Over time the radioactive potassium isotope decays into argon. The ratios between the two stable potassium isotopes and the remaining radioactive potassium isotope gives us a good estimate of the original amount of total potassium that was in the sample.

Now measure the argon, physically trapped in the sample. The argon MUST have come from radioactive potassium decay. If we do the math, we get a measurement of when the sample was formed.

Guns exist as tools to serve to two pursuits for most modern people. Defense and sport.

Well the natural evolution of that idea is to be armed. And an AR-15 is simply the modern answer to that. 

It doesn't have to be an AR-15 by the way. Any semi auto rifle with removable magazines will do. Nearly all military's have been equipping their forces with similar rifles since the 50s.

The vast, vast majority of handguns don't have an upper receiver, so it certainly looks like the guy who doesn't understand the basic construction if firearms is this dude. 

Background: Legally, every new, commercially manufactured gun must have a serial number. The part with the serial number (it has to be a key part, often the receiver or frame), is the part that's legally a gun. The rest of the machine is just gun parts, which you can transfer without a background check. (You can buy them through the mail in fact.)

AR-15s are a bit unusual, in that they are a bit like Legos, with a ton of parts you can put on or off and customize to your heart's content.  Their receivers are split into two pieces, upper and lower. The lower is the part with the number.  So, for an AR, it's not a terrible suggestion. The friend could certainly order a new upper, but the immediate option is gone.

However, as mentioned, almost no handguns have upper receivers. (The principal exception is ARs that are technically handguns.)

A similar concept of removing a barrel or slide would work for some handguns, but not all. Semiautomatic handguns vary in how difficult they are to break down. Most modern revolvers would require some light gunsmithing to get anything off, and since fit and mechanical timing of those is so key, I'd think most owners would want a pro to out it back together.

[],rickthehatman,,,[],,,,text,t2_etc4h,False,,"Sure glad to discuss.  I read up on Bernies policy on his campaign website. He supports an assault weapons ban and a ban on magazines which hold more than 10 rounds. I am wholeheartedly against these policies. The infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens and will not reduce gun violence in any statistically significant way. You are about [4 times as likely](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls) to be stabbed to death as murdered by a rifle of any kind from an AR-15 to an old school hunting rifle.  Of the roughly 200 to 400 annual murders committed with rifles, there's no reason to believe that if assault weapons weren't an option, these people wouldn't have been murdered with another weapon such as a handgun or shotgun. I do like that Bernie isn't calling for mandatory buybacks (aka confiscation), and he is consistent on his position that suing gun manufacturers for the misuse of their products is frivolous. As a general statement, I dont like any of the Democratic candidates gun policies as a whole, but Bernie's is not as bad as some of his opponents. I also like Bernies other positions on other issues so I feel like a President Sanders would most likely expend his political capital more towards policies with which we agree, ending the war on drugs, tackling climate change, Medicare for all, and his immigration policies as opposed to focusing  all his efforts on the policies where we disagree. 

I'm as pro gun as a person can be, and I'm also fairly liberal.  I didn't vote Trump, but took solace in his election that at least he would be good for guns. Meanwhile, he promised such things as removing suppressors from the NFA and concealed carry reciprocity and despite having a conservative majority in Congress, the Supreme Court, and the White House for 2 years we got none of that. Given that power, if the Republican party was a pro gun as they say, someone in California should be able to buy an AR-15 and someone in Kentucky should have their concealed carry license be valid in all 50 states but that isn't the case. 

In short, I dont agree with a lot of what Bernie says on guns, but I like a lot of other things he says and his stance on guns is better than most of the other Democrats running.

[],Sleepy_Thing,,,[],,,,text,t2_2x6eb9lv,False,,"Gun owners and guns rights advocates can't define anything on a logical level.  For instance a AR-15 is an ""Assault"" weapon.  Why?  High mag, fire rate, etc.  However when gun manufacturers effectively released a handgun variant of the exact same rifle down to the point where you can buy a stock that is separate purchase that functions exactly the same as the AR 15 stock and the mag, again separately, does not define the weapon as an assault category, but functions near identically.  We get into things like the New York state laws and how the ones who break it most often are ones that bought guns purposefully out of state after the law was passed, *knowing* it was passed and circumventing it.  

The issue is we aren't arguing that people shouldn't have less guns ***period*** which should be the case, or that access to guns should be highly limited, we are arguing semantics that don't change the fact that a large majority of all gun fatalities comes directly from handguns and shotguns which are often times the most concealable and most effective in basically all civilian crimes ever.  Gun owners and specifically the NRA try to frame the whole debate based on what constitutes an assault weapon or what constitutes high capacity and not say, the logical fact that your gun can have 2 shotgun shells or 8 handgun bullets and you can open fire and kill 8 people in 30 seconds.  The whole debate on semi auto, auto, clip, mag, etc are highly irrelevant when we KNOW the problem is the access to guns, regardless of some BS standard of what is or isn't an ""Assault"" weapon while gun manufacturers consistently toe legal lines to basically enable illegal weapons to be purchasable if you go through extra steps, case and point being bump stocks which effectively turned anything they were slapped on into an automatic weapon that were legally purchasable.  

Guns are nondeniably built on a basic level to be a murder weapon used to kill other people. Whether or not the murder is justified is highly irrelevant. Moreover we know that access to guns increases gun based fatalities as accidents, suicides, and of course murders and mass murders become more common in states with far more lax gun control such as Texas which is the ""Mass Shooting"" state as a direct result of metric fuck loads of guns and insanely low bar of entry for gun ownership.  Moreover a lack of a thing like a federal registry means that a crook in one state can effectively circumvent the system by going to a more conservative state to buy a gun because some states are so fucking lax that they can easily get their hands on a murder weapon they shouldn't own.  

Gun owners have a direct cognitive dissonance that because *they* can handle their guns and not use them for the prescribed, mechanical and design reason for their creation that *everyone* should have access which isn't true.  For reference, Jason Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter was a perfectly legal gun owner for DECADES of his life and committed one of the highest casualty mass shootings in the nation \[Upwards of 940+ causalities resulted from injuries caused directly or indirectly by his spree\] despite being a legal gun owner all his life, enabled by lax gun laws, debates on things like ""Assault"" and ""Self Defense"" BS and most importantly a late response to Bump Stocks which we knew would cause problems the second they were released.  Several other mass shooters took their guns from home and went to school and shot one+ people because, even though *they* shouldn't have access given their age or whatever they had direct access to a gun to a point where they could very easily get access to a gun that had only ever shot paper targets before.  

Access to guns leads to more gun deaths, both intentionally and unintentionally, that's basic, logical fact, moreover guns serve 0 purpose to 99.9% of the populace as exceptionally few will ever need a gun to defend themselves or their property with an insane few even needing it for farm life at this point.  We own 60% of the world's firearms within our borders for civilians, we have more guns in hands than we do have people alive in the US, and we very clearly have a gun problem directly enabled by ignoring say, Handguns and Shotguns, the two most common weapons that we can directly pin hundreds of thousands of deaths on at this point going back decades given their size and capabilities.  By focusing our legislation on hyper specific BS that gun lobbyists and gun owners *want* us to do we are less safe as a nation because we are doing bans on say, any mag that isn't 9 rounds but ignoring the fact that you shouldn't have the gun size of your pocket.",1568140185,{},eztwgmb,False,t3_d262gq,False,True,t1_eztfgot,/r/science/comments/d262gq/majority_of_americans_including_gun_and_nongun/eztwgmb/,1568140186.0,1,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good ole Copypasta here

Listen, you fantastically retarded motherfucker. I'm going to try to explain this so that you can understand it.

You cannot control an entire country and its people with tanks, jets, battleships and drones or any of these things that you so stupidly believe trumps citizen ownership of firearms.

A fighter jet, tank, drone, battleship or whatever cannot stand on street corners and enforce ""no assembly"" edicts. A tank cannot kick down your door at 3AM and search your house for contraband.

None of these things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation. Those weapons are for decimating, flattening, and glassing large areas and many people at once and fighting other state militaries. The government does not want to kill all of its people and blow up its own infrastructure. These are the very things they need to be tyrannical assholes in the first place. If they decided to turn everything outside of Washington D.C. into glowing green glass they would be the absolute rulers of a big, worthless, radioactive pile of shit.

Police are needed to maintain a police state, boots on the ground. And no matter how many police you have on the ground they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians which is why in a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while the people have nothing but their limp dicks.

BUT when every random pedestrian could have a Glock in their waistband and every random homeowner an AR-15 all of that goes out the fucking window because now the police are outnumbered and face the reality of bullets coming back at them. If you want living examples of this look at every insurgency that the U.S. military has tried to destroy. They're all still kicking with nothing but AK-47s, pick up trucks and improvised explosives because these big scary military monsters you keep alluding to are all but fucking useless for dealing with them.

[],Capn_Mission,,,[],,,,text,t2_8l4aa,False,[],"&gt;Metal is the closest of all contemporary genres to classical music.

While the above isn't a sentence I would ever type out in a public forum, I suppose one could argue for the truth of that statement by focusing on complex metal subgenres (e.g. prog metal, death metal) while ignoring the less complex metal subgenres (e.g. metalcore, sludge/doom metal, thrash). 

One could compare the complexity of prog metal to the more complex examples of formal western music. One could also symponic metal to the music of the romantic composers.

That being said, there is a level of subtlety in most western formal music that is completely lacking in metal. Even ""Bach rockers"" like Yngwie Malmsteen seem to have zero interest in the subtle aspects of classical music. While a sheet music transcription of Yngwie's music might look quite similar to that of sheet music of the baroque era, his approach to playing those notes is as far from classical as you can get.

What other contemporary genres (let's assume the commenter above was limiting those to things like soul, country, hip hop, rock, pop, etc.) are more like classical than metal? I suppose prog rock is probably just as much like classical as certain metal subgenres. Some ""new age"" artists also have similarities with some forms of classical music. Some of Yanni's music has similarities with romantic compositions. Ludovico Einaudi could also be compared with classical music.

There are number of classical guitar players that create music that is quite reminiscent of the baroque style. However, the commenter above may not have been familiar with those artists.

Popular orchestral music from film scores (think John Williams) is probably closer to classical music than metal is to classical music.

Finally, the late tango songwriter and bandoneon performer, Astor Piazzolla made music that is closer to classical music than most metal is to classical music",1569798070,{},f1xgp0a,False,t3_db0y25,False,True,t1_f1xd0oi,/r/science/comments/db0y25/rebellious_music_genres_such_as_rap_punk_and/f1xgp0a/,1569808459.0,4,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You're aware of binary, counting to base 2, 0 is 0, 1 is 1, 10 is 2 etc?

Physically on the wire then +5V is 1, 0V is 0. You send those down along the wire from one end to the other and you have a very method for sending data.

That kind of works if you control both ends of the wire and there's only one wire but add more and wires and now you don't control both ends you have to start wrapping your ""data"" bits with destination information, like an envelope around a letter.

And then you have to agree with everyone what your envelope looks like.

And then you realise that it's possible, due to random errors and the like, or even deliberate interference to have your message corrupted.

So you have to add error detection to your envelope so you know something has gone wrong. And methods to correct or resend.

And then you decide that trying to send a 16k file in one go, and having to re-send the whole thing in one go if there's an error is a bit onerous. So you break it into parts, lets call them packets. Each with their own copy of the address label but also a tag which says where they fit into the correct order to re-create the original.

You have to do this because earlier packets can be overtaken by later packets, for example because the earlier packet had to be resent or took a different route.

And you have to do this in a way everyone agrees otherwise they can't talk to each other and you end up with something like TCP/IP which has packets which look like this:

But they're still all just physically a series +5V and 0V (actually it doesn't have to be +5 or 0 it could be any pair of voltages but +5 and 0V ar common) voltages travelling down a wire.

Reporting about batteries that doesn't use industry figures is gonna be pretty wild guessing at best.  Li-ion battery efficiency is all over the place.  Different chemistries and types obviously vary, but more than that the efficiency for any particular battery can be anywhere from 99.9% to 60% depending on the conditions of use.  

Normally warmer temperatures mean higher efficiency, but not during slow deep cycles (when side reactions ar important and ion conductivity is not) or extremely shallow rapid cycles (when the battery acts like a capacitor).  Theyre much more efficient around 50% charge, so if you have to carry charge for a hypothetical future it's a problem.  Parasitic losses at high charge and high temperature multiply to become worse than either.  Losses increase with current squared, until your cycle depth is only a few percent or less when the battery becomes more efficient than any other time.  Fast discharge is more efficient than fast charge.  Then there are all of the losses to balancing (which accumulate differently based on usage), temperature management, switching, etc.

Typically if you see someone describing batteries as 95-98% efficient they're basing that on discharge efficiency.  RTE is much lower as charging is inherently less efficient and also there is no incentive to optimize for it.  Even then RTE is often under very good circumstances, like 10x slower charging than discharging, limited depth of discharge, and no wait time between cycles.",1565190853,{},ew7f1bl,False,t3_chm70g,False,True,t1_euxigpe,/r/askscience/comments/chm70g/askscience_ama_series_were_from_the_pacific/ew7f1bl/,1565190865.0,1,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What is antimatter?\*\*

Antimatter is matter that is made of antiparticles. Antiparticles have the same mass, but opposite charge and other quantum properties. When a particle and antiparticle meet they annihilate win a burst of high energy light (known as gamma rays).

Note that they have \*opposite charge\*. So antiparticle of an electron (negative) is a positron (positive)

\*\*Have we made antimatter Iron?\*\*

No.

We have never made an atom of antimatter Iron, let alone a magnet sized amount of iron you could see in your hand. The cost iof making antimatter is prohibitive, and it is very dangerous. 

We have made Anti hydrogen and anti helium at CERN however. 

\*\*What is a magnetic field?\*\*

A magnetic field is the area around a magnetic where there is force, and moving charges can make magnetic fields. 

Atoms often have electrons grouped together in pairs. One electron spins one way, the other electron the other way.

Some materials have \*\*unpaired electrons\*\* - that is an electron spinning on it's own. In that situation you have the potential for a magnetic field to be created if you get all the unpaired electrons to line up. \*\*Unpaired electrons can create a magnetic field\*\*

\*\*What causes the magnetic field in Iron?\*\*

Well Iron or Fe has a configuration of  \[Ar\] 4s\^2 3d\^6. What this means is there are \*\*4 unpaired electrons\*\*. Now, these unpaired electrons aren't lined up, but you can \*\*induce them to line up by using an electromagnet\*\*.

See this image here showing the regions aligning:

\*\*Could you create a magnet made of anti-iron?\*\*

Yes in theory if you had a powerful enough particle accelerator you could create anti Iron (it would cost trillions at least).

And the unpaired electrons would be positrons, so the charge would be opposite,

However the magnetic field in the anti-iron, just like the magnetic field in Iron \*\*would be induced by an external field\*\*. So, my understanding is the an anti-Iron magnet would create a magnet just like a standard magnet.

[],functor7,,maths,[],,Number Theory,dark,text,t2_4nrp2,False,,"You need a setting where the ""Line at Infinity"" is actually a thing. If we use coordinates, then the ordinary plane is the collection of all points (x,y), where x and y can be any real numbers. In this setting, a line is the solution set of an equation of the form Ax+By=C, where A,B and C are real numbers, and at least on of A or B is nonzero. Two lines, Ax+By=C and Dx+Ey=F are parallel if AE=DB. We can clearly see that if AE=DB and C and F are not equal, then there are no simultaneous solutions to these equations and so the lines do not intersect. 

This is kinda inconvenient because we have theorems like ""All distinct pairs of lines intersect exactly once, unless they are parallel, which don't intersect"". Almost all pairs of lines have this nice property, and there are very few exceptions, but the existence of exceptions means that this is not a wholly reliable property that pairs of lines have. We essentially have two options, either accept that this is not always true and that there are these messy pairs of lines that don't intersect. Or, we can conclude that all pairs of lines *should* intersect, it's just that the plane itself is too small to contain the place where parallel lines intersect. We'll investigate this latter case, as it cleans up our understanding of lines and is flexible enough to apply to other situations.

The way we'll do this is find a simple way that kinda does the trick, but is unsatisfying. We'll then use this as inspiration to make a somewhat usually unmotivated construction that allows us to do these things more naturally.

To do this, we need to extend the plane. But we don't want to extend it too much. For instance, one way to extend the plane is to go into 3D space, and we can then say that the line Ax+By=C is actually just the plane Ax+By=Cz in 3D coordinates (x,y,z) where the plane z=1 corresponds to the original plane. In this case, if the lines Ax+By=Cz and Dx+Ey=Fz are parallel, then they will actually intersect in the plane z=0 along the line Ax+By=0 in that plane. You can interpret this as follows: In if we have two lines Ax+By=C and Dx+Ey=F, then the corresponding planes Ax+By=Cz and Dx+Ey=Fz will intersect along a line in 3D. This line always intersects (0,0,0) and, in the case when they are not parallel, some point in the plane (x,y,1). This is because this line is oblique to this plane. As the lines get more and more parallel, the point of intersection, (x,y,1), goes out further and further from the origin and the 3D line of intersection begins to flatten. When Ax+By=C is parallel to Dx+Ey=F, then their 3D intersection line is parallel to the plane (x,y,1), and the point of intersection on this plane has been pushed out ""off"" the plane. This extension is fine, it offers some intuition. It works. Instead of the theorem ""All non-parallel lines intersect once"", we get the new theorem ""All lines correspond to planes that intersect along a line"". We've gotten rid of the non-parallel condition, but at the cost of the singular intersection point. Moreover, when we extend this theorem to higher dimensions, we still have things like parallel planes to deal with. If we extend the ""All non-parallel lines intersect once"" to higher dimensions, we get the theorem ""All non-parallel planes intersect along a line"" or ""All non-parallel 3D spaces in 4D space intersect along a plane"" etc. In all of these cases, the intersection set has dimension 1 lower than the object in question, which we lose when we use this higher dimension model. Moreover, it's a fairly unsatisfying setup and seems pretty ad hoc. We want a more universal way to extend flat, Euclidean space so that can take care of all of these cases, in a way that is *intrinsic* to this space, that doesn't lose the 1-lower dimension, and doesn't force us to continually work in higher dimensions.

To resolve this, we can take inspiration to what we did above. After all, we *did* manage to get parallel lines to ""intersect"". The key was the third coordinate z, as we could set it to zero and the line of intersection would be Ax+By=0. But we want this to be a single point. We note that, in this case, the solution set in 3-dimensions to Ax+By=0 and z=0 are the points (Ar,-Br,0) where r is any real number or, more pointedly, (Ar,-Br,0\*r). That is, all of these points are the same up to scaling by r. What we want is for this ""plane"" of intersection to actually be a line, so we're going to do something very drastic and just say that this line is really only *one* point. 

We're going to use three coordinates (x:y:z) to describe our space, but instead of having each triple of number correspond to their own point, we're going to say that two triples (x:y:z) and (u:v:w) correspond to the same point if they are the same point up to scaling by some value r. That is, if u=rx and v=ry and w=rz. For instance, we have (1:2:3)=(3:6:9), they're the same point because they are the same up to a scaling factor of 3. This set of points is called the [Real Projective Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane).

Now, just what does this new projective plane look like? Note that if z is nonzero, then we can multiply the point (x:y:z) by the scaling factor of 1/z to get the point (x/z:y/z:1) and, moreover, the only way that two points (X,Y:1) and (U:V:1) are equal is if (X,Y)=(U,V) in the normal, traditional sense. That means that the ordinary, traditional plane lives inside the projective plane and is equal to the set of ""projective coordinates"" (x:y:z) where z is nonzero. This accounts for almost all points in the projective plane. So what about the points of the form (A:B:0)? Well, we can see where they live by ""tracking"" the point (A:B:Z) as we send Z to zero. This means that we'll be seeing where the point (A/Z,B/Z) goes on the plane as we send Z to zero. When we do this, the point will travel along the line Bx=Ay in the plane out towards infinity. This means that we can thing of the points (x:y:0) as the points ""at infinity"" or, as we usually call it, the ""line at infinity"".

Some may have noted something off here. When we track the point (A/Z,B/Z) as Z goes to zero, it's fine that it goes along the line Bx=Ay, but there are *two* directions we can go to infinity with. If Z goes to zero from the positive numbers, it will travel along Bx=Ay in one direction and if it goes to zero from the negative numbers, then it will travel along Bx=Ay in the opposite direction. This process simultaneously sends (A/Z,B/Z) to completely opposite infinity points. But, for this to work, we need (A:B:0) to be a single point. And this is what we do. If we imagine the entire euclidean plane surrounded by a circle ""at infinity"", then to make the real projective plane, we'll need to take points on this circle that are opposite each other and glue them together into a single point. In this context, for instance, opposite infinities are the same. This is why visualizations of the real projective plane[look weird](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CNV9w.png). 

This is good, this real projective plane is, essentially, the ordinary real plane but with a circle weirdly wrapped around it. It's and extension, but not too much of an extension. Note that each point on this line at infinity corresponds to a *slope*. The point (A:B:0) corresponds to the slope of the line Bx=Ay. Intuitively, then, parallel lines should intersect at the point at infinity corresponding to their shared slope. A line on the real projective line is the set of all projective coordinates (x:y:z) that solve an equation of the form Ax+By=Cz and the solution to Ax+By=0 ( ie (-B:A:0)) corresponds to where it intersects the line at infinity. We can check and we find that non-parallel lines still only intersect at one point. But now, if Ax+By=Cz and Dx+Ey=Fz are parallel (which means that there is some nonzero real r so that D=Ar and E=Br), then they don't intersect off the line at infinity and, moreover, they intersect the line at infinity at the point corresponding to their shared slope: (-B:A:0) = (-Br:Ar:0) = (-E:D:0).

This is much more satisfying. We've only included the new points that we actually need. These new points allow us to say that ""All pairs of distinct lines intersect exactly once"". It makes more natural many other theorems in classical geometry, eg [Pascal's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_theorem). Furthermore, there are natural generalizations to this in higher dimensions that make everything nice and analogous to this. Moreover, the interpretation of their intersection makes sense of being ""at infinity"" while also having the natural understanding of they intersect ""at"" their slope, which is the same.

We can look at other objects in the projective plane, in particular we can look at conics. In the projective plane, we can conclude that all non-degenerate conics are of the same type. That is, there is nothing to distinguish between ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas intrinsically, and the only way to classify them is how they interact with the line at infinity. An ellipse/circle is a conic that does not intersect the line at infinity. A parabola is a conic that intersects the line at infinity once, ie is tangent to it. And a hyperbola is a conic that intersects the line at infinity twice. The hyperbola intersects the line at infinity at the two slopes corresponding to the its two asymptotes, so we can think of their asymptotes as being the ""points at infinity"". In fact, if you trace along a hyperbola and when you get to an asymptote, you cycle around you'll trace both sides of the hyperbola nicely.",1560009406,{'gid_2': 1},eqetlsa,False,t3_by8hlc,False,True,t3_by8hlc,/r/askscience/comments/by8hlc/whats_the_mathematical_proof_that_demonstrates/eqetlsa/,1560009417.0,234,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,1560234112.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,

,iayork,,bio,[],,Virology | Immunology,dark,text,t2_3qn2z,False,,"We don't *know* what they sounded like, but anatomy and comparative phylogeny give us some clues. Obviously, the sounds in movies are not even guesswork, they're just put in for dramatic purposes. 

Anatomy gives some hints, but they're fairly crude -- no one could look at the anatomy of a nightingale, a parrot, or a hyena and be able to predict the sounds they make. And the sound-producing structures we know of are often soft tissues, so they don't fossilize well.  We do know that dinosaurs had ears (don't take anything for granted!) so it's reasonable to assume that they could communicate by sound. 

On the other hand, vocal cords are not universal, and even where they're present it looks as if they evolved independently:

&gt;Many tetrapod vertebrates (Tetrapoda) produce sounds by vocalisation, the vibration of mucosal folds called vocal cords that extend into the lumen of the respiratory tract (Figure 1). Vocal cords occur in Anura (frogs and toads), Ambystoma + Dicamptodon (mole salamanders), Mammalia (mammals), Gekkonidae + Eublepharidae (geckoes), Pituophis melanoleucus (the bull snake), Crocodylia (crocodilians), and Aves (birds) ... Morphology, topology and phylogenetic distribution indicate that vocal cords arose independently in each of these groups

In particular, the syrinx (the organ that modern birds use to make their elaborate sounds) is relatively recent, and wasn't present in non-avian dinosaurs, so it's not likely that T. rex sang lilting melodies to each other. 

&gt;Vocal production by the syrinx depends on the presence of a clavicular air sac, a soft structure that invades and pneumatises the bones of the avian pectoral girdle and limb, marking its presence with a characteristic opening on the humerus.Such an opening is present in members of the avian clade Ornithothoraces – which includes modern birds and the Lower and Upper Cretaceous taxon Enantiornithes – but not in birds basal to Ornithothoraces ... Without evidence for a clavicular air sac homologous with that of birds, we should not presume that basal birds and non-avian ornithodirans possessed a functioning syrinx.

(The point of this, of course, is that birds are dinosaurs, so looking at birds is one way of figuring out what non-avian dinosaurs did - but in this case, it's not as helpful.)

&gt;The lack of evidence of a syrinx in ornithodirans outside Ornithothoraces will, no doubt, disappoint fans of roaring movie dinosaurs. However, lack of ability to vocalise does not necessarily mean that such animals were silent altogether. Many extant reptiles communicate with each other and with potential predators by non-vocal acoustic means such as hissing, clapping jaws together, grinding mandibles against upper jaws, rubbing scales together, or use of environmental materials (e.g. splashing against water) ...  Birds also use non-vocal acoustic means of communication such as hissing, bill-clapping, stamping and wing beating. Non-avian theropods with feathered wings may have beaten their wings in acoustic displays as extant birds often do. Sauropod dinosaurs of the family Diplodocidae, known from the Upper Jurassic of North America and Africa, possessed whiplike tail tips that could have produced loud, whiplike cracking sounds for intraspecific communication or in response to predators

You can also look at hearing -- for example, tyrannosaurs probably had very good low-frequency hearing ([New insights into the brain, braincase, and ear region of tyrannosaurs (Dinosauria, Theropoda), with implications for sensory organization and behavior.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.20983)) -- but it's hard to tell if that's for communication, or say for tracking prey. 

One group of dinosaurs that have been looked at fairly intensively for sound production is the Lambeosaurines, which include the species with those enormous crests -- the guess has been that they might have been used for sound production. As far as I know, that's still considered plausible, since (for example) they seem to have been able to hear in the same sound range that the crests would have produced ([Endocranial Anatomy of Lambeosaurine Hadrosaurids (Dinosauria: Ornithischia): A Sensorineural Perspective on Cranial Crest Function](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.20984)).

Although scientists generally prefer the metric system, it can be very useful to think of pressure in terms of imperial units. When we say the pressure at sea level is ""14.7 pounds per square inch"", that literally means for every square inch of the surface, there's an extremely tall skinny column of air pushing down on that square with 14.7 pounds of weight.

That also means that if you add mass to the atmosphere, the weight will increase and thus so will the pressure.

For most of the excess CO*_2_* we've created in the past 150 years, it involved digging up carbon compounds, burning them, and releasing the exhaust into the air. That means most CO*_2_* molecules we create first had to find an O*_2_* molecule to bond with...so while we're removing oxygen molecules, we're adding carbon dioxide molecules.

Since CO*_2_* has a molecular weight of 44 while O*_2_* has a molecular weight of 36, we're essentially increasing the weight of those molecules by 44/36 - 1 = 22%, which in turn means we've increased the pressure.

Bear in mind, though, we're only talking about a tiny fraction of the total atmosphere here. In the past 150 years, we've gone from 280 ppm to 410 ppm CO*_2_*. That means we've replaced 130 ppm = 0.013% of the molecules in our atmosphere with one that's 22% heavier.

If the average molecular weight of the air was roughly...

78.09% N*_2_* + 20.963% O*_2_* + 0.93% Ar + 0.028% CO*_2_*

= 0.78082 * 28 + 0.2096 * 32 + 0.0093 * 40 + 0.00028 * 44

= 28.9545

...and it's now...

78.09% N*_2_* + 20.95% O*_2_* + 0.93% Ar + 0.041% CO*_2_*

= 0.78082 * 28 + 0.20947 * 32 + 0.0093 * 40 + 0.00041 * 44

= 28.9560

...which means that the pressure has increased by about 28.9560 / 28.9545 - 1 = 0.005%.

,RobusEtCeleritas,,physics,[],,Nuclear Structure | Nuclear Reactions,dark,text,t2_gekpw,,,"&gt;How are we so sure that the Strong force only operates in small distances?

Because the only place we observe the effects of the strong force are within subatomic particles, whose length scales are on the order of femtometers.

We can do scattering experiments to get information about the range over which the forces act, and it's clear that the strong force only operates over very short distances.

&gt;Does the strong force not obey the inverse square law?

There are multiple different things that you could mean when you say ""the strong force"", but none of them obey an inverse square law.

* The quark potential

The potential that quarks feel when they interact with each other is of the form:

V(r) = ar - b/r.

The -b/r term looks exactly like Coulomb's law or Newton's law of gravity; it corresponds to a 1/r^(2) force between two monopoles. However there is also the linear term, which dominates at large distances. You might think that this is a long-ranged potential, however due to QCD confinement at low energies, quarks can only exist in bound states of neutral total color charge. The strength of the force sets the typical length scale over which these bound states form, and it's around 1 fm. So even though the this force would have infinite range, it's never observed to act over distances more than 1 fm or so.

* The residual strong force

Quarks are confined to exist within bound hadrons, but even so, hadrons can still interact with each via the strong force if they are close together. This is the force that binds protons and neutrons to form atomic nuclei.

This force is short-ranged. It can be modeled as an exchange force where the force carrier particles are virtual mesons. A theory with a single meson would give a potential of the Yukawa form:

V(r) = a\*exp[-mr]/r.

m is a constant related to the mass of the one meson. So this is just like a Coulomb potential as well, except it's modulated by the exponentially decaying factor. This is due to the fact that the force carrier particle has mass.

In reality, the residual strong force is some complicated combination of multiple Yukawa potentials, with various spin and isospin operators, three-body forces, etc. But all of the contributions to the potential are short-ranged.

* The nuclear mean field

Within a nucleus, you have A nucleons, all interaction with each other via the residual strong force described above. That's a very complicated quantum many-body system, and it's very hard to study nuclei above the lowest mass numbers because of how complicated problems like this are to solve. So instead, you can use techniques like the nuclear shell model, where you just model a small number of valence nucleons (or holes) under the influence of some ""mean field"" potential due to all of the other nucleons. The choice of mean field is somewhat arbitrary, as whatever is left over is swept under the rug of ""residual interactions"", but a very common choice for the nuclear mean field is the Woods-Saxon potential (plus a spin-orbit potential). The Woods-Saxon potential has the form:

V(r) = -V*_0_*/(1 + exp[(r - R)/a]).

R is the ""radius"" of the potential, and a is the ""diffuseness"". If you plot this function, it very rapidly approaches zero in the vicinity of r = R. This means that the mean field potential felt by a nucleon within a nucleus goes to zero very quickly outside of the nucleus. This potential is very short-ranged as well, as nuclear radii tend to be on the order of ~ 1 - 10 fm.",1537404805,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e6ah47k,False,t3_9hah44,,True,t3_9hah44,/r/askscience/comments/9hah44/how_are_we_so_sure_that_the_strong_force_only/e6ah47k/,1539311644.0,25,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,,0.0,1399076266.0,True,False,,0.0,1.0,2699.0,r/askscience,public,,

,e-chem-nerd,,,[],,,,text,t2_hqpxd,,,"The letters s, p, d, f stand for ""sharp,"" ""principal,"" ""diffuse,"" and ""fundamental."" These are historical names that come from how they were discovered, as lines in emission spectra from various elements. They represent the different degenerate orbital groupings of angular momentum 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

To find an electron configuration you first have to understand the major energy shells and orbitals: these represent the possible electron states that get ""filled up"" as you move across each period (row) in the periodic table. You also have to understand the rules for filling up states, including the Pauli Exclusion Principal, the Aufbau Principal, and Hund's rule.

Each period represents another major shell of energy levels for electrons to occupy. They are called periods because the properties of the valence electrons, also known as outer-shell electrons, were found to repeat after a certain number of energy levels were filled. The major energy shell of an electronic state can be written down as n.

The s p d and f orbitals are sets of degenerate (equal in energy) states that represent the spatial extent that electrons occupy in those energy states. The first time they show up, these orbitals have 0, 1, 2, and 3 nodes, or places where the probability of finding the electron drops to 0. Each subsequent time the orbital shows up, its number of nodes increases by 1. So a 1s and a 2s orbital (the initial number is the period it shows up in) look different, but both have orbital angular momentum of 0 and both have spherical symmetry, so they are both ""s"" orbitals. Because each of these types of orbital has different angular momentum, we can write down the orbital angular momentum l to distinguish between them. The first time an s orbital shows up is in the 1st major energy shell, the first time a p orbital shows up is in the 2nd major energy shell, etc.

Each possible energy state also has an associated magnetic angular momentum, given as m_l. This number can take any integer value from +l to -l. So for an s orbital, m_l = 0 only, but for a p orbital m_l = +1, 0, or -1. This means there is only one 1s orbital, one 2s orbital, etc. but three 2p orbitals (and three 3p orbitals, etc.). 

Finally, each orbital can contain two electrons with opposite magnetic spin of +1/2 and -1/2. The magnetic spin is written as m_s. Together, the principal energy level/major shell, the orbital angular momentum, the magnetic angular momentum, and the magnetic spin make up the 4 quantum numbers that uniquely identify an electronic state (n, l, m_l, m_s) can be written down to uniquely identify a single electronic state. The Pauli Exclusion Principal (PEP) states that only one electron can occupy any unique state at any time. Therefore, each orbital can contain only 2 electrons as each orbital has a unique n, l, m_l and the two electrons would have opposite m_s.

So now that we know how to describe all possible electronic energy states, how do these states get filled? First of all I want to stress that these rules are for ground-level energy states. It is possible for an atom to be in an excited state where an electron is not at the minimum energy, but in the absence of some outside force that electron would eventually decay back to its ground state. Speaking of outside forces, these rules are true for isolated atoms in a vacuum. Putting atoms in a medium such as in a solution or packed into a crystal lattice could possibly change the ordering of these energy levels. That is essentially what happens in crystalline materials that gives them the properties of appearing different colors.

The aufbau principal (or ""building up"" principal when the German is translated to English) gives the order that groupings of orbitals will fill up. Why this order? Because in an isolated atom, that is the order of energy from lowest to highest. The energy of each state in major energy level n is equal to -13.6 eV /n^2 so you would think that each major energy level fills in order and within those energy levels it doesn't matter which state fills in first. However this formula is only true for a 1-electron atom and with more electrons the total energy of each state also depends on electron-electron interactions. In this case, 2s states fill before 2p states and 3s before 3p before 3d because the higher the orbital angular momentum the further a state is found from the nucleus and the closer electrons will shield the further out electrons from the positive nuclear charge, thereby increasing the energy of the states on the periphery of the atom. The audbau principal gives the ordering 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, etc (no atoms with electrons above 7p have been made or observed).

You might have seen something interesting - the 4s states come before the 3d states! Well this is for the same reason as the argument for why 2s fills before 2p - the difference in energy levels due to shielding is enough to put 3d above 4s in energy. A good way to remember this order is graphically called the ""diagonal rule"": just write out the orbital groupings as follows

1s 
2s 2p 
3s 3p 3d 
4s 4p 4d 4f 
5s 5p 5d 5f 5g 
6s 6p 6d 6f 6g 6h 
7s 7p 7d 7f 7g 7h 7i ... 

Then draw lines diagonally from the top right to the bottom left. The first line passes just through 1s, the second line just passes through 2s. The next line passes through 2p and then 3s. The next line passes through 3p and then 3s. The next line passes through 3d, 4p, 5s. And so on. Note that g, h, and i are the names given to the degenerate orbital groupings with angular momentum 4, 5, and 6, respectively, even though they haven't existed in any atoms yet. They are simply alphabetical from f and have no other historical meanings. While these orbitals aren't occupied in atoms we have discovered yet, we often talk about electronic states in other systems being ""s-like"" or ""p-like""; in these systems it might be possible to have a ""g-like"" electronic state.


Edit: I had another few paragraphs written up that I lost when my app crashed. There's a good starting point and technically you have everything you need to write down electron configurations, there are just a couple additional rules like Hund's rule: ""always half fill every degenerate orbital before filling any"" and ""half-full and full sets of degenerate orbitals are more stable than any other configuration"" which means that you get things like [Ar] 4s^1 3d^5 for chromium's electron configuration instead of [Ar] 4s^2 3d^4. You can look up these details if you are further interested.

There is a value we use called Cv (pronounced C sub V or simply C.V.) that is the flow coefficient of an orifice (a hole).

Basically, a Cv=1 is a hole that will flow 1 gallon of water per minute with a 1 psi differential.   The formula is Cv=Q*(SG/dP)
Q= flow in gpm
SG=specific gravity
dP=differential pressure.

We used to use a Cg for gas but we’ve since gotten rid of it and use a much more complicated equation to equate it to Cv.

We won’t go into that mess, but the Ar (application ratio or dP/P1 plays a significant role due to gas compressibility.

Finally what limits the gas flow is sonic velocity, or the velocity of the gas = speed of sound in that gas/pressure.   Gas can’t flow faster than that on its own, we call that choked flow.   There is also the vena contracta, point in a flow stream where the instantaneous pressure is at its lowest.  This is even lower than the P2.  Obviously we can’t have a VC lower than space, so this complicated the calcs a bit.

Cv of a 2mm hole is approx less than 0.17.

The dP was very low (14.7 approx) and the Ar very high (1) so the resultant flow would be extremely low.

Just using the sonic velocity the max flow would be about 1/2 cubic ft per second but falling constantly as air is lost.  Reality would be 1/4 of that or so due to the Venturi caused.

On edit:  running it through my flow program I came up with about 1 cuft per minute.

,Lashb1ade,,,[],,,,text,t2_aop49,,,"Stars with rings:

The Sun does have a number of ""rings"", such as the asteroid belt, but of course this belt is *extremely* empty - you are unlikely to see any large object whilst passing through. It is necessary for any ring in orbit around a body to be low density, since any ring which had a high density of matter will slowly coalesce into a planet given time. Ring systems can be found around young stars that are still forming their planets, or *possibly* in systems that recently experienced some sort of major event, such as a collision between two planets. Not a star but with regards to rings: the rings of Saturn are something of a curiosity- they shouldn't be stable over long periods. One theory suggested that Saturn's rings were formed relatively recently due to the breakup of a moon.

Stars as planets:

This sounds like a [binary star,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star) a system with two stars orbiting each other. Whenever you have multiple bodies in space, they will orbit around their mutual centre of mass. If one object is significantly larger than the other, the centre of mass of the two will be very close to the larger one, so the larger object will barely move, and the smaller object will circle it. Amazingly, about half of all star systems contain two *or more* stars- there is no real upper limit to how many stars can form together.

Some of our most famous stars are actually systems: [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius), our brightest star, is one example of a binary system with a large star (Sirius A) being circled by a much smaller one (Sirius B). [Alpha Centurai,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri) our closest neighbour is a three-star system. There are huge systems like [Castor,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_(star\)) -6 stars- which [is arranged](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/infographics/infographic.view.php?id=10884) so that there is a pair of stars, orbiting another pair, the four of which are being orbited by a third pair. The possible joint record holders are believed to be [AR Cassiopeiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR_Cassiopeiae) and [Nu Scorpii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Scorpii) with seven.

Special orbits:

What we have -elliptical orbits, with low eccentricity so that the orbits appear circular- is a very stable configuration. It's possible to contrive strange orbits like [this figure 8 orbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihlh4q9qss0), but these are unlikely to exist naturally: they require very precise starting conditions to form, and minor perturbations are prone to causing the orbits to fall apart.

,CrustalTrudger,,geo,,,Tectonics | Structural Geology | Geomorphology,,,t2_ee0f4,,,"There are a [lot of different types of radiometric dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating) so some of the steps will be very different depending on the system. I'll give the rough steps for something like U-Pb dating of zircons, which is a pretty common technique within geochronology, but I'll also highlight just a little of the wide array of variability in techniques.

1) Identify a rock/deposit/material that is possible to date via some geochronologic technique and for which the date is meaningful (i.e. it at least in part answers or contributes to some question you are researching, generally we don't just date things for the hell of it).

2) Collect a sample suitable for dating. This is one where what this entails will depend on the technique. For many techniques, ultimately we're going to be dating individual mineral grains so the goal is to collect a sample of rock which we estimate will contain a suitable population of said minerals and that is reasonably 'fresh', meaning that we don't want to collect some really weathered portion of rock because there might have been some chemical/thermal alteration, etc. For some techniques, we may actually try to collect the sample material directly from the source deposit (e.g. for radiocarbon, sometimes you will actually directly pick out bits of charcoal from a deposit) and some techniques have specific sampling protocols (e.g. optically stimulated luminescence dating requires that the sample is never exposed to light, meaning that they are usually collected by beating a pipe into a target deposit and sometimes sampling at night). 

3) Process the sample. Again, this one depends a lot on the particular technique, but lets stick with what you would do for techniques that ultimately require separation of particular mineral species from a host rock (e.g. U-Pb on Zircon or Monazite, Ar-Ar on Feldspar or Mica, U-Th/He on Zircon or Apatite, etc). Generally you will crush the rock (with a hammer, mortar and pestle, or a variety of different machines like a 'jaw crusher' or 'disc mill'), then sieve the crushed material to narrow down your sample to a particular grain size (again, depending on technique/mineral).

4) Mineral Separation. For the techniques like U-Pb in Zircon, you need to get the zircon (or whatever your target mineral is) out of the now sieved crushed rock. There are a lot of things we can do to separate out particular minerals ([e.g. this list of techniques published by the USGS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2016/1022/ofr20161022.pdf)), but will generally rely on exploiting physical properties of our target mineral that differentiate it from other minerals. This usually means multiple different steps of separations exploiting the magnetic properties and density of the target mineral. Until you've done this yourself, I can't really emphasize how much really laborious work this entails. 

5) Pre-analysis. Again, super variable depending on technique. E.g. for [Ar-Ar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon%E2%80%93argon_dating), you would package up your separated grains and send them to a reactor to be bombarded with neutrons to convert K^39 to Ar^39. But sticking mostly with our zircon example, we have two main pathways. If we're going to analyze our grains by [laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry) (LA-ICPMS) we will mount grains in little pucks of epoxy, polish these pucks very precisely so that we have an almost mirror smooth surface that has essentially bisected the grains that were mounted and then image them, usually by [cathodoluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathodoluminescence), to identify growth zonation with images like [this](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1319&amp;bih=691&amp;ei=WU3wWvKFH6LejwTNyLHABg&amp;q=cl+images+of+zircons&amp;oq=cl+images+of+zircons&amp;gs_l=img.3...866.3718.0.3870.21.12.0.8.0.0.136.912.9j2.11.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.10.840.0..0j0i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i8i30k1j0i8i10i30k1.0.sXoDgGiNUc4). If instead we were going to date our zircon by [thermal ionization mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_ionization_mass_spectrometry) (TIMS) we would dissolve the zircon in various acids and then put these dissolved products through a series of ion exchange columns to separate out the uranium and lead and then precipitate these on a filament that will be loaded into the TIMS (this is a real simplified version of just one TIMS technique, specifically isotope dilution, or ID-TIMS, there are other ways of getting the zircon into a TIMS instrument, but this is getting way into the weeds and beyond my comfort zone).

6) Analysis. If we're doing LA-ICPMS, we load our sample puck into the vacuum chamber of a laser setup attached to the mass spec and use an image of the puck to pick areas to 'ablate' with the laser, the product of which is moved into the mass spec by an inert gas where the ratios of various isotopes of interest are measured (this leaves out A LOT of details of what's happening internally). If we're doing ID-TIMS, the main difference is that we are using heat to ionize the chemically isolated residue of a zircon and then introduce this to a mass spec (this is leaving out a lot of details of what type of mass spectrometer we're talking about, but usually, at least for LA-ICPMS we're talking about a multi-collector or sometimes a quadrupole, but again, this getting way into the weeds).

7) Post processing the data. Same caveat, this will all depend on the technique. For LA-ICPMS of zircon for U-Pb, there will be a lot of computation to convert ratios of isotopes into ages with various corrections applied, e.g. along with your unknowns, you always mount a bunch of 'standard' zircon grains on the puck which have known ages and a sample analysis run might look like this: shoot 5 standards, shoot 5 unknowns, shoot 1 standard, repeat this 5-1 process until you're out of unknowns, shoot 5 standards. You use the calculated age of the standards to correct for variability in various aspects of the instrument (i.e. the age of the standard should equal the known age of the standard). There is a lot that goes into analyzing the quality of the data, e.g. the U-Pb system actually has to different isotopes of uranium that decay into two different isotopes of lead, so we can use the ages determined by both systems (visualized on things like a [concordia diagram](http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/classes/Geo656/656notes03/656%2003Lecture09.pdf)) to identify grains that may have been influenced by some process that leads to an inaccurate age.

Caveat to all of the above. I am not an isotope geochemist or a specialist in geochronology. I have done geochronology (mostly on zircons with LA-ICPMS) multiple times, but always collaborate with someone who specializes in this so especially when we get to the nitty gritty details of the mass spec workings and delivery of material into the mass spec, I don't have all of the details so there are definitely some gross simplifications in the explanation above.",1525699214,,dyl0yjo,False,t3_8hjo0k,,True,t3_8hjo0k,/r/askscience/comments/8hjo0k/could_someone_please_explain_to_me_indepth_how/dyl0yjo/,1527178444.0,6,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,,0.0,1387221389.0,True,,,0.0,1.0,45143.0,,public,False,

,larsoncore,,astro,,,Star Formation,,,t2_q25i5,,,"Hi ! This question has been a hot topic in star formation for a long time now. What I say is valid for low-mass star formation (lighter than 10 solar masses), but we are not sure to which extent it applies for heavier stars.

/u/Imxbftw has already given some elements, for example the fact that star formation involve a lot of different processes whose energies ar all the same order of magnitude. But I want to tell you the story of the angular momentum in star formation, since this is almost exactly your question.

Indeed, the star-forming clouds (called dense cores) have a spin. I don't know if you are familiar with the concept of angular momentum, but you can think of it as a ""rotation inertia"" that is supposed to be conserved. As a consequence, when a spinning object condeses, its rotation accelerates (like in figure skating). From observation, we can determine the angular momentum of dense cores, and calculations show that their collapse increases the rotation so much that no star would be formed because of the centrifugal force. The surface of the sun would have a rotation velocity of nearly the speed of light ! 
However, it is also observed that the angular momentum of young star is 1000 times lower that those of dense cores, so a large fraction is removed during the process. That was the ""angular momentum problem"".

Now we have an excellent candidate : the magnetic field. A process called [magnetic braking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_braking) (I can explain if you wish) is able to transport the angular momentum away and significantly slow the rotation.

You can stop there to have the big picture, now I will add some details and the continuation of the story.

To test the hypothesis of the magnetic braking, numerical simulations have been performed. They showed that indeed, rotation was significantly slowed which allowed the formation of a star. BUT ! the rotation was so slow that it was impossible to form a [protoplanetary disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk), structure orbiting around the young star in which planets form. This is known as ""the magnetic braking catastrophe"".
Another problem comes from the magnetic field itself : the magnetic field in the young star is several order of magnitudes higher than what is observed. With these models, we would predict that the magnetic field of the sun would be 10 millions times larger. This is known as the magnetic flux problem.

The two problems have a common origin : the model to describe the behavior of a fluid in a magnetic field is simplified. It assumes a perfect coupling between the magnetic field and the fluid. This is known as ""ideal magnetohydrodynamics"". Since recently (last ten years), people have started to refine the models and take into account decoupling terms. This has not been done before because they are difficult to handle in numerical simulations. The question still have no clear-cut answer, but the results are extremely promising.

[This diagram explains it better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect#/media/File:Greenhouse_Effect.svg). So you should probably include a rock in the container to absorb the sunlight and release irradiated heat for the CO2 to capture. 

Alternatively, you could get a couple of those heated rocks used for pet reptiles and use those as your heat sources. As long as the electricity supply remains constant the heat output should be constant, and you won't have to worry about any possible differences in sun exposure.

If you want to do this with proper controls, it gets a little complicated.

H2O, CO2, CH4, and O3 are greenhouse gases. So I would do this experiment using pure N2, or N2 mixed with CO2. Assuming a cubic meter of volume at standard temperature and pressure, 400 ppm of CO2 is 775mg of CO2. So 1 gram of dry ice is probably close enough. So if I were doing this experiment, I'd get a cubic meter box with a release valve, flush the box with N2, and then add 1 gram of dry ice and seal the box. Wait until the CO2 had totally evaporated, then open the valve to release excess pressure. Wait for temperatures to get back to equilibrium (releasing the pressure will cool the gas), then turn on the heated rock and monitor the temperature over time.

Another answer says that blood is ""very easy to get nutrients from"". That's the opposite of the reality. Vampire bats have had to evolve many very weird adaptations to survive on blood, because it's really a terrible source of nutrition. It's a very dilute source of any nutrients, it doesn't have enough carbs, lipids, or glucose, it has virtually no vitamins, and it's toxic for several reasons:

&gt;Blood is a challenging dietary source because it consists of an ~78% liquid phase and a dry-matter phase consisting of ~93% proteins and only ~1% carbohydrates, providing very low levels of vitamins, and potentially containing blood-borne pathogens. ... Obligate sanguivory requires adaptation to very low levels of some nutrients, such as essential amino acids and the vitamin B complex, and very high levels of others, such as salt ... 

--[Hologenomic adaptations underlying the evolution of sanguivory in the common vampire bat](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0476-8)

To get anything out of blood, vampires need to drink a huge amount of liquid, because the actual useful part of blood is a minority fraction. Accordingly, as soon as vampires start feeding, they also start to pee it out. (They never show this in Dracula movies, I don't know why.)  

&gt;Initially, a bat gorges itself with blood, often consuming as much as 40 to 60% of its body weight. This is the time when diuresis is at its highest ... During the second stage of digestion, after the ""instant diuresis"" has voided most of the ingested water, the bat is faced with digesting and assimilating the highly nitrogenous remains of its blood diet with very little available water.

--[Digestion and Assimilation of Bovine Blood by a Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1380446)

On top of  that, blood is toxic. If you were to drink enough blood to satisfy your nutritional needs, the iron in that volume would kill you. 

&gt;This animal is an obligate sanguivore and has a daily intake of dietary iron 800 times that of man. 

--[Distribution of iron in the gastrointestinal tract of the common vampire bat: Evidence for macrophage‐linked iron clearance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ar.1091980206)

&gt;Iron concentration represents a significant challenge to sanguivory. Although the concentration of free iron ion is not high in the blood, severe haemolysis (for example, during digestion of blood) could result in high levels of iron that, if absorbed in excess, could accumulate and disrupt the normal function in organs such as the liver, heart and pancreas.

--[Hologenomic adaptations underlying the evolution of sanguivory in the common vampire bat](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0476-8)

Salts are also a problem.

&gt;This challenge is exacerbated by the abundance of salts in blood, which pose additional osmotic and blood pressure challenges. 

--[Hologenomic adaptations underlying the evolution of sanguivory in the common vampire bat](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0476-8)

So, now that we're on the same page, back to answering:

[Combustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion), as Wikipedia plainly explains, ""is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant"". So to answer your question, we need to find another **gas that could function as an oxidant**.

Ozone is one possible substance, if we are excluding only O₂, and it would be a good choice for combustion, since it is a more powerful oxidant than O₂. The reduction (that's what happens to the oxidant) of ozone is actually more energetically favourable than for dioxygen, as one can see comparing the [electron affinities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_affinity_%28data_page%29). (Note: Redox potentials [e.g. for O₃](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/0014-5793%2882%2980886-7/pdf) or other options could be discussed, but as these are solution and pH dependent, it's easier to discuss the electron affinity for thinking about what *might* be a good gaseous oxidant). However, it would be unlikely to find a planet with an atmosphere containing a significant amount of O₃ because O₃ is generally formed from from O₂ in the presence of UV light. Additionally UV light also causes the breakdown of O₃ back into O₂, so there will typically be an equilibrium of the two (with more O₃ at high altitudes). 

A chemist's next step is usually to move one row down on the [periodic table, on account of the similar properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_periodic_table) (including reactivity) displayed by elements with similar numbers of [valence electrons in the outermost (valence) shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell#Valence_shell), which is indicated by the column. Also, moving from the first row to the 2nd, there's a [slight increase in electronegativity](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6QSVD.gif), which should result in a more energetic reaction. So, moving one down from oxygen,
 we find sulfur/sulphur. So if O₂ is good, then S₂ should be even better. Analogous to dioxygen, [disulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfur) is also a molecular entity that exists as a gas at higher temperatures (of course, some planets will be substantially hotter than ours). However, because of the weaker S=S double bond, it is less stable than O=O, and readily degrades in sunlight. ([Sulfur, I should note, has a fascinating range of allotropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_sulfur), which make for much more structural variety than we observe with oxygen.)


Another option is to look at heteronuclear molecules. There are certainly a few heteronuclear molecules which could also be considered, however, several of the ones that are common in our solar system are not oxidizing agents. Moreover, the electronegativity difference that drives many reactions is decreased because of the [partial ionic character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bonding#Comparison_with_covalent_bonding) of the bonds in a heteronuclear molecule. 



The next option that I would suggest are the [halogen gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen): F₂, Cl₂, and possibly Br₂ or I₂ (depending on the temperature, as they would need to be gaseous). Because of the very high electronegativity, these are very [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine#Reactivity). 

&gt; ""The bond energy of difluorine is much lower than that of either Cl₂ or Br₂ and similar to the easily cleaved peroxide bond; this, along with high electronegativity, accounts for fluorine's easy dissociation, high reactivity, and strong bonds to non-fluorine atoms. Conversely, bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorine's high electronegativity. Unreactive substances like powdered steel, glass fragments, and asbestos fibers react quickly with cold fluorine gas; wood and water spontaneously combust under a fluorine jet.""

It should be noted that if one had an environment with such gases, it would tend to be all-around corrosive. In addition to the ready reactivity of these gases, the byproducts of combustion often include strong acids, such as HCl. 
Additionally, not all exothermic reactions will be accompanied by a flame, just as [not all reactions with oxygen will result in a flame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember), either. But to demonstrate that some do result in flame, I would direct you to a video of hydrogen gas combusting with chlorine gas, as [demonstrated by Peter Wothers (U. Cambridge) on the Royal Society for Chemistry's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtygiCwnEzw) as part of his public lecture and demonstrations on [""Fire and Flame""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npAHHGPPC94&amp;list=PLLnAFJxOjzZvK056qKGTumPUkiCJb0W6B). 


I hope that answers your question from a *hypothetical* *chemistry* perspective. As for what combinations of planetary compositions, temperatures, and pressures *might* exist, it's very difficult for *me* to say (I lack the expertise). There do exist [astrochemists](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/chemistry-careers/astrochemistry.html) and [astrogeologists](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/) who would be more able to answer the question of what conditions are definitively possible. But [exoplanet spectroscopy](https://www.nature.com/news/the-truth-about-exoplanets-1.19388) for the determination of conditions and composition or the [potential for the detection of extrasolar life](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/35/12634) is only a nascent science. 

***

As a side note, I think it's a great exercise to imagine the possibilities of chemistry, different than our what is found on Earth, or even in our solar system, that could or might exist on other worlds. Considering ideas such as [non-carbon-based life](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-silicon-be-the-basi/) or [hypothetical biochemistries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry) gives the chemist new ideas about how to *emulate* life's processes in artificial systems. It can also help the scientific community to avoid the trap of [looking only for what we recognize in the search for extraterrestrial life](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/will-we-know-alien-life-when-we-see-it) and it opens our mind to [""weird"" chemistry in lifeforms on this planet](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120709-arsenic-space-nasa-science-felisa-wolfe-simon/). And it can even inspire some really [great works of science-fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andromeda_Strain) or [excuses for a bigger SFX budget](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiliconBasedLife).

The proportion of light that gets reflected is referred to as the Earth's [Albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo).  The light that is absorbed causes heating of the Earth's crust.  

As I stated above, Planck's law (which defines electromagnetic radiation emitted from a body) states that the Earth will emit light just like the sun does.  However, as the Earth is much cooler, the wavelengths are much longer i.e. the energies are lower. 

We can use [Wein's law](https://www.ajdesigner.com/phpwien/wien_equation.php#ajscroll) to quantify this.  The surface of the Sun is about 5500°C (= 5773 K) [[1]](https://www.space.com/17137-how-hot-is-the-sun.html).  This gives a peak wavelength of ~500nm, which corresponds to visible light.  In contrast, the average Earth surface temperature is roughly 15°C  (=288K)[[2]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page2.php).

,Rhyk,,,,,,,,t2_5xmvr,,,"A good way to think of this is to consider the radiation that comes in from the sun.  The Sun's energy arrives through light, but this isn't just the light we see - there are more energetic waves, for example ultraviolet and a (very small amount of) X-Rays, and there are less energetic waves, for example infrared waves and microwaves.  


The majority of this wavelength passes undisturbed through the atmosphere (we can call the atmosphere *transparent* to this light), and is absorbed by the Earth.  This causes the Earth to heat, and [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law) tells us that the Earth therefore also emits energy through light waves.  However, because Earth is not as hot as the Sun, the light is at a lower energy (think microwaves and radio waves).  

Whilst O2, N2, and Ar are transparent to these waves, other molecules such as CO2 and methane (CH4) are not.  They absorb the energy from these waves and trap the heat in the atmosphere, instead of allowing it to float off into space.  This means that the relative amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere is unimportant - it's the absolute quantity that counts, and as there is a *lot* of atmosphere, even a 0.01% increase means a lot more CO2 and hence a lot more trapped heat.

Going down a row and across a group from Ar to K, you've added 1 electron but you've also put that new electron far further than previous ones (i.e. its orbital is in a new shell, 4s). Whereas Ar had a stable configuration of electrons, K is more stable if it loses its new one and becomes a +1 ion - there are energy stabilizations to be had with pair electrons, effective nuclear charge, and other factors that make this the case - and thus, elemental K is reactive. 

You may notice that going from extremes, i.e one side of the table (noble gases to alkali earth metals), there's a lot of difference, but the addition of one proton, and thus electron, between adjacent element of the same row (e.g. between K and Ca) doesn't make as much of a difference in reactivity. Transition metals can be interesting in this regard as they have many additional electron configurations often available to them (*vis-a-vis* d orbitals) meaning a multitude of different oxidation states with varying reactivities - they're often somewhat different in terms of reactivity across the row to their neighbor, but more similar down the group (in some attributes).

The 2 main channels of retroaction are the melting of icecaps and the effects of increasing aridification on plant cover and erosion rates.

When icecaps and alpine glaciers melt, it affects the distribution of mass in mountain chains and continents, and isostatic rebound will subsequently  act in such a way as to counterct this effect.

At this point the clock speed is essentially a matter of cooling.  The sticker clock speed on the 9900k is 3.6Ghz, which is no faster than what you could get 10 years ago.  (And not faster than 4Ghz)

&gt; It isn't a question of whether it can be done, but if it's worth it.

I kind of get what you're saying, but I think it's very misleading.  If a chip manufacturer was able to make a CPU with a faster clock speed they would be willing to dedicate a very significant amount of resources to do it.  But they can't, because we have fundamental issues with (as you say) heat as well as errors.  This didn't use to be the case.

Even the largest and most expensive supercomputers in the world use clock speeds that aren't far off what they were a decade go.

&gt; Clock speed increases have slowed down, but not stopped

The clock speed increases in the last 10 years have been pretty insignificant.  But it's true that processors are getting slightly individually faster.

[],thereddaikon,,,[],,,,text,t2_6gopw,False,[],"They can make processors faster than 4ghz. Intel has an upcoming revision of the 9900k that should be able to boost all cores to 5ghz. Over a decade ago IBM made a transistor that ticked over 50ghz.

It isn't a question of whether it can be done, but if it's worth it. Raising clock speed incurs a lot of penalties elsewhere, primarily in power usage and heat generation. Heat generation is usually expressed as TDP in watts*. All other things being equal, if you raise the clock speed you will increase power draw and heat generation. This means you need beefier power delivery and cooling which increases costs and also feeds back more power draw and heat generation for the system as a whole. 

Heat and power aren't the only considerations though. When you really start to pump the clock speeds you can also run into signal integrity issues. The execution pipeline of a processor consists of many complex circuits that must operate in lock step. If anything were to get out of sync then you start to generate computational errors which will manifest as instability in software. Programs may behave erratically or outright crash. Maintaining signal integrity comes down to the design of the chip and also the fabrication process. This is one of the reasons why companies like Intel and TSMC spend billions of dollars on improving their fabrication techniques and shrinking the feature size. This is also why cooling is important in overclocking, as heat increases so does resistance to the point where it can threaten clock stability. 


Clock speed increases have slowed down, but not stopped, because fabrication processes are not improving at the same rate they once were. This was the easy solution to raising clock speeds. Every new process would usually shrink the feature size by half and allow for proportionally less voltage to run the processor. Moore's law is dead and has been for awhile now so while there are improvements in process tech it is slowing down. Intel originally planned to roll out their 10nm process in 2016. Today it has only been used in a few mobile chips.

I've been doing a lot of reading recently about this and have come across the question of projective representations of symmetry groups. This is my understanding so far: the Hilbert space has to support a representation of the symmetry group, except that the elements of the group can also be associated with an additional phase. (I've usually seen these notated as c(g1, g2).) These phases cannot be randomly picked since they have to in the end be consistent with the overall group structure, and this restricts possible choices for the final group that ends up being represented on the Hilbert space. In the example of SU(2), the phase picked up is of π after a rotation of 2π, hence the double-covering of SO(3). Would you say my understanding so far is correct?

I'm really interested in your last paragraph. Could you give some examples of quantum systems with SO(3) symmetry without spinor representations? Would a particle in a radially symmetric potential count?

Getting rid of the smartphone makes sense. Many of the devices have become expensive albatrosses and they have been slowly approaching a point where the physical size of the device will limit huge hardware innovations. As it is, the biggest improvements now are coming through software and the camera hardware. 

How do we “move on” from smartphones? Apple Watch hardware has already evolved to have connectivity without a iPhone (WiFi and cellular). With improvements in battery life and CPU it could serve at some point as a replacement for the iPhone.

And the implication is that law breakers break the law by acquiring said firearms via straw purchase or theft and bring them in? Almost like the law breakers don't break the law?

And tell me, where did the Mexican Cartels get their M16s? Because it wasn't from their more liberally minded neighbor to the north. And the most recent Australia mass shooting? Was that a banned shotgun on a single nation island? But hey, they got that good censorship over there, amiright? And France, they are part of the EU which in generally has stricter gun laws anything in the US. Yet the Charlie shooters managed to get full autos... and just recently, I read a report of a Frenchman who shot a waiter over food delivery? And raids that turned up illegal anti-armor weapons?

When I started 6th, my new teacher started me at a 5th level in the program.

[],Savbav,,,[],,,,text,t2_1s7hynrs,False,,"Late in the ballgame for this thread, but wanted to share my experience anyway. I am American, and was behind academically until I got to secondary school. In the US public school system, there is this program called, Accellerated Reader (AR). It assesses a student's reading level based on what an average grade level should be reading. It holds a database of books and tests on those books to get kids reading at progressively higher levels as students go through the program.  Once a reading level is set, the program requires the student to only read in the set level.

I consistently tested into two grade levels below my peer group until I was 11 years old (6th grade). So, this meant that when I was in 3rd grade (age 8), I was required to read and test on picture books meant for a 5 or 6 year old while everyone else was reading basic chapter books like Hank the Cowardly Dog. I tried checking out one of those chapter books, because I wanted to know what all the excitement was about and fit in. I tried this several times throughout that school year and the next in a different school. Every single time, I was specifically told, ""You can't read this. It isn't in your AR level.""

I can't read- that's what was told to me for three years (because before 3rd grade, I really didn't care what peers were reading). So, what was the use in trying anymore, if every single time I was shot down? So, I began to despise reading. Sure, I would go through the motions, but had no interest in completing tests in the AR program- because it told me and the adults that I had the inability to read.

In 6th grade, it all changed when my teacher threw out the AR program for her class (still used a database to track progress), and told me that I could read anything I wanted and she'd help me with the harder concepts. You know what I read first? Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, 2-3 years after the initial release and most of my peers were anxiously finishing Prisoner of Azkaban and/or waiting for Goblet of Fire.

Then again, I only have been exposed to one, which is *The Happiness Project*, and it sounded cheesy AF and it won't work for me.  I was in a high school class that was a PE class with Fridays being classroom days, which is when the teacher reads one chapter of the book out loud for the class while we colored.  I was the oddball out, so I had no people to partner up or group up with.  There were other factors that made me an anxious and depressed mess during those times, so being read this book just made me bitter...  At least I got to color something.

I just see those books as insulting because I went through mental illnesses and they have this ""just get over it"" vibe to them.  With that said, never make these a substitute for real mental health assistance.

\---

On the other subject of not enjoying reading until you realized that you looked into the right books, I had the same experience starting from my senior year in high school.  Prior to that, I was in the Accelerated Reader programs.  I hated it for limiting my books in an already small library to those I have no interest in while the good books were either out of my level or not an AR book.  I wound up just taking 0s in middle school, especially because I had another class limit my genera to science fiction (a genera I have absolutely no interest in with the exception of Jurassic Park the novel.  If there are any more similar ones that involve biology, let me know).  Not to mention that I am a slow reader, a person with a forgetting problem, very picky with what media I consume, and most of all; struggle with comprehending things I read.  I also had a couple of years where I was being tutored and their reading requirements were worse...

When I got an English teacher that just required reading one book per quarter plus a book report that you can reflect the book in your own way and make an art project based on it, reading was less stressful and much better.  I started with Animal Farm because of animal characters and ideas everyone should know about, a book about anxiety for another class requiring a book report on a nonfictional illness book, Mr. Popper's Penguins I brought from home to prepare for the movie adaptation, and my most favorite; Sister's Red.  For the first time with that last book, I could not put it down.  It had everything that clicked with me; a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood, suspense, a sisterly relationship, and werewolves.

After graduating, I picked up *The Lost Diary of Don Juan* from the library.  I also love that one to pieces.  Since then, I just hoard books like how a dragon hoards gold and read one at a time.

So what can I say?  Just let the students read what they want and let them reflect the book in their own way.

[],Bushidoo,,,[],,,,text,t2_tlj3v,False,,"Except you can't... I've been attempting to translate page 58 for the last 3 hours and I am pretty sure this dechipherment is wrong. The first problems appear when trying to interpret the script itself, using this technique: the sign over the /e:/ long ee sound, resembling a comma, is not covered in the paper, yet seems important, as translation sans results in a row of ""eee""; next, I foun non-Romance consonant clusters ""pqu"" or the cluster t/d+ v, which is Indo-European but not Romance; next, there is an extra leter, the ""n"" letter but with an oppened top.

Now, moving on to the words: most of the long words don't have a meaning in any European language (or in any at all), but have Romance patterns. I found a dozen words ending in ""-ar"", a verbal ending still present in Spanish, affixed to pseudo-latin stems such as ""rotat-"" or ""naus-"", which might mean ""to rotate"" and ""to navigate"" (considering that ""-ar"" is an infinitive ending.) What I found and what matches are shorted words and certain plants; I found words such as 

""os""= the, in Aragonese

""rora""= to drip, in Latin

""nais""= to give birth, Modern French

""orea= to air out, in Spanish

What really makes his theory seem wrong is that almost every page begins or contains at least a ""magical formula"", such as: 

__Pesaua emeos emeor emeia tpeeoema__

which has a certain ring to it and might be related to the Latin ēmēre, the plural perfect active of ēmo= to buy 

__Lor eeema (eeima?) dolea emena namena aluna oretein opetein aleeena (aleeina?)__

All in all, I think the text is probablly in cypher and any atempt to translate it normally won't work. The only way a text could have patterns such as the ones in the Voynich, or strings of sounds such as ""eee"", is if it is encoded with type of substitution cypher in which more letters in the same sentence can somehow get the same encoded value. I tried working a bit om this theory with the first ""formula"", but to no avail.

,TheLostWhisper,,,[],,,,text,t2_2bkfs3yn,False,,"No, China is more dystopian if only for standard of living reasons. I agree with your points. I hate the surveillance state and the state in general. However, China is much, much worse than most likely realize due to factually incorrect reporting. The lie that it has been greatly liberalized and capitalism has been allowed is not true. A state-crony-capitalist regime has begun but it is not anywhere near a free market. Of course, it is better than the state-communism they had but it is still terrible. You also have social credit rankings, no due process (well, Obama effectively signed into law the ability to assassinate a US citizen without due process as well but it is likely this would be challenged if it happened in the US. The context was a US citizen and his children who claimed allegiance to a terrorist organization), an actual rape culture and patriarchy, worse persecution of Christians than many realize (this goes for Jews and Muslims as well but there aren't nearly as many in the country), and they lack gun rights which at least somewhat slow the creep of the state if only minimally. If a group of state edict enforcers (cops) came to round up some group they can at least band together and use modern sporting rifles (AR 15) to put up some fight (see how Asian communities across the US have defended themselves from riots as most famously demonstrated in California). Trans, gay, jews, and every other group have the ability to take their self-defense into their own hands in the US if they ever needed too. The lowest people on the social ranking system just come home to find their female family members raped and imprisoned with them quickly following. Of course, US cops rape occasionally and the corruption of cops is likely way worse than we realize but the comparison is not even close to being equal. There is also a much less normalized morality in China. People on average are just going to be worse due to them needing to be worse to survive. As poverty and hardship increase the moral fiber decreases. The reason violent crime is rapidly decreasing, and has been for a while, is simply because more of the world is becoming wealthier. 


All that to say, the US is really not close to being as bad as China for the average citizen. Any measure, whether it is leisure time, quality of life, and wealth, is significantly higher in the US than China.

I was in one of those AR programs, and was always good at reading so I was given a very high reading level and made to read books that were massive slogs because they were really long and quickly got me to my point goal for the month. I wanted to read Alex Rider, and, y'know, kid books, but logically it didn't make much sense to because they weren't helping me meet my reading goal.

Then you get into middle/high school and start reading ""literature"" and doing ""analysis"" of it. I came off with the distinct impression that things I was into like dragons and space marines were deemed ""lesser fiction"" and apparently to be an adult I had to read about really mundane people waxing philosophical about their mundane problems. Then we had to ""analyze"" it, the class all came to the same obvious conclusions the teacher lead us to, while the teacher went on about how deep and clever and hard to understand it was. And you had to pretend the book was super interesting even if it was super boring. Everything that was apparently so ""literary"" in these books could be found in genre fiction, but because those books were fun or had characters with actual problems it was deemed lesser. 

If you want boys to read, just let go of the reins and let them read. Yes, they'll read about knights, and bug monsters, but that's what boys are interested in, and you need to let them know reading is enjoyable to make them lifelong readers. Then let them find ""literature,"" whatever that means. The only book I actually liked that I was allowed to read for school was The Iliad because it had awesome manly men, and war, and gods, but it was old, so apparently it was ""literature."" That and 1984, but they had us read enough books that one would connect eventually. Once I was out of school I actually started reading books that would be considered ""literary"" just for fun, because they sounded interesting to me. I think if you just encourage boys to read, you'll be surprised at some of the books they eventually pick.

Many of my friends, who were intelligent and willingly researched Warcraft or Elder Scrolls, or LotR lore, showing they actually were interested in fiction, similarly disliked their English classes, and rarely read novels in their leisure time. Boys really like genre fiction in my experience, I think because the conflicts tend to be more literal.

I personally find it quite interesting and genius honestly. **As a really bad thing.** How the small man gets told how bad everything is and making the small man or woman feel bad about themselves while the actual culprits for the bad stuff are politicians and big corporations. 

I don’t agree with you that he didn’t address the aspect of the racial slur. In the video he mentions the fact that their africaness was used as a negative thing.

I found his point quite interesting how media. And that is something that happens everywhere. Addresses immigrants as French or Germans or whatever nationality when they do something good but as soon as it’s a bad thing, they are the African immigrants.

I found his explanation quite fair. 
He addresses the fact that humor is subjective. He addresses the fact that he knows that some right wing French people use the Africanness as a slur. And then he explains his point of view.

He seems to echo a lot of the new agey stuff such as blaming the people of a certain colour or nationality over things they had no influence over, assign the term privileged to people and so on.

For a quite smart man with a keen understanding of language and differences in culture, he seems fail to understanding that's hes sellin a different flavor of the same ice cream.

He also annoyed me when people called the French NT team Africa and the French ambassador said that the French see themselves as the French and they dont hyphonate because it drives up the differences between people. In that moment Trevor said that he was proud of their Africaness (whatever the hell that means) and that it doesn't matter to him what the ambassador said.

Sorry but you don't get to decide Trevor, the player's do. You don't get to tell the people that they are inherently African or in some large part that because you want to feel proud of shared but very distant roots. The players have the right of self determination and maybe some feel at least a bit African, maybe others don't at all, but the point is that it wasn't his place to decide.

Also one of the points of the letter which he missed conpletely is that Team Africa was a sort of a racial slur, the point of the letter was to firmly assert that France refuses to see the players as anything below a bona fide 100% baguette eating, cigarette smoking art loving Frenchie.

Start with this guy and a few other characters. Such as a widow who dines with her husband every night, eating the same meal and having the same conversation. Or a mother who cares for a lost infant, constantly getting up late at night to sooth a crying baby. A man who plays old retro video games with a lost sibling, freaking out when his old game console fails. Or a father who drives his kid to school, because its the only memories he has stored because he always worked too late. Parents who force the other siblings to reenact party games or holidays with a lost sibling. Each one struggling with their grief to a point that augmented reality memories are adversely affecting their lives. Once you build a few of the characters back stories and supporting characters, weave the stories together and have an ending of sorts that gives maybe a measure of closure or at least bereavement from their suffering and loss. For bonus points I would include someone who could create black market false memories, or augmented memories as it were. I would include them somewhere in the story where the memories of a certain event become corrupted and they are the only ones to replace the lost data be recreating it, maybe even adding to it. The AR junkie getting his fix. You could even mix in a whole AR dark net subculture too, with people buying custom made celebrity memories or something darker. And there is a decent name, Augmented Memories. Short, sweet and to the point. 

Season two would start with finding out that someone can hack your augmented inputs and create false interactions making people believe its reality and not the augmented overlay. Literally talking to people who are not there, but instead talking to a specific, sophisticated AI built just for the target. But 100% real and appealing to the intended target, and can even bleed into the surrounding peoples AR given close proximity. Then build a plot around taking over the people in charge of the AR network and bringing it down from the inside, as every one in the world uses it. Each character profiled would be interacting with something using them as an insider man. Except for the last character, who is also an AI being trained or built by an AI but it doesn't know its an AI yet. And since the tech exists to create false reality, the network must be taken down before the Government or Evil Empire uses it to pacify the populace, could be the motivation behind taking the network down. Leave all that on a cliff hanger on who wins, the hackers or the Evil Empire. 

Season three, who knows? Maybe both, one story where the AR network is down, and one where the Evil Empire wins and who knows whats real anymore. Kind of a fractured or layered reality. Make it where you can not tell which one is the real world, by weaving story lines into all realities. Maybe for an ending, the people who thought they won, did not really win, but was given that reality to them by the Evil Empire to finally pacify them. Maybe an AI was playing everyone all along, doling out perceived realities like psychological treatments to patients.

I just felt having an eye implant or something layering your vision is more grounded than implant directly connected to your brain.

They are similar when it comes to the setting. They are both during a date (in a restaurant). This was mostly a budgetary limit. Having one location where they don't move a lot.

But the main difference is the theme. I wanted to explore how technology could provide a certain escape from dealing with loss. The main character uses technology to avoid moving on...He's stuck in a manufactured reality (by choice).

A properly recorded memory shouldn't have any noise merely because it's been rewound 3000 times.  It's digital. They aren't vhs tapes!  The only reason would be if it wasn't properly recorded in the first place, or if it got damaged somehow.  

Actually not unreasonable to imagine it had been damaged or whoever recorded it didn't know what they were doing, or even it got interrupted in recording.   IMO, if it was an old memory recorded late, or he had brain damage when it was recorded, I wouldn't think it would have noise like that.

The eye implants appear from time to time to make them noticeable to the audience. 

The waiter isn't really mad with him he's actually worried. They've had this conversation many time and he knows the man shouldn't keep doing this. The man has become an addict to an old memory and can't move on from it. The waiter dosen't want to keep enabling his addiction.

The date is a passed recording. It's like when someone watches a video of someone that has passed away but in this case he can interact with it ( in a scripted way). If he numbs himself enough to the memory then for a second it actually feels real.

The glitched cut is just the way the recording looks when it's paused and rewinded. Since it's an old memory (older tech) - I felt - It should have some digital noise.

He likes replaying that part because it's the highlight of his lost relationship. I don't mention what happened because I want people to wonder if she died during their relationship or if she left him (even the actor has his own interpretation).

I didn't understand why their AR contacts kept appearing and disappearing. I could understand if you only caught a glimpse of them in certain light or from certain angles, but that didn't seem to be the case.

Also, I didn't understand why the waiter would have such a vehement beef with the guy being there. No one has to see her except the guy, and in AR-world people carry on conversations with invisible people all the time, looking at them and interacting with them even thought no one else can see them. In what way are his actions -- ordering a drink and carrying on a conversation -- more offensive or troubling than anyone else, unless on previous occasions he became emotionally distraught.

Also, it seems like there are inconsistencies in her representation: is she simply a recording of their actual first date, or is she a product / AI? If the former, you'd expect the recording would also include the diner, her coffee, the actual waiter, etc. If the latter, why isn't she fully interactive?

And in either case, why would the recording / AI raggedly cut out immediately after saying she likes him? Was she killed at that very instant in an explosion and, if so, why don't we see at least some evidence of that? But if she didn't die in an explosion, and the point is to show that he is obsessed with someone he can never have, wouldn't it be more interesting if she got to the point where she says ""I really like you"" and then follows it with ""... but,"", and it's at that point he always rewinds.

Finally, it didn't feel like the story really leveraged AR that much, especially if she's just a recording of an actual date. I get that it allows the experience to be more immersive for him, but this same story could be basically told today using mobile phone tech.

c) yes more would be better but at some range, it still would be hard to hit something just imagine the spread of the shotgun approach after a few million km. to create a ''grid'' or wall of projectiles 60 000km high and 60 000km wide (how far a ship traveling at 0.2 light travels in just one second) and if we have a maximum dispersal of 100m you would need 360 000 projectiles/rocks if we have a dispersal of 1000m we need 3600 and this just to cover ''1 second'' we still need to know precisely where the target is going to be at that time and ''wall' would just have that dispersal at one time it would either be closer or farther apart given the nature of the ''shotgun'' approach see ''inverse square law''  (unless we have 360 000/3600 ships ofc) and the logistic of firing a barrage like this would be a nightmare

It was flawed, it was choppy, it had a bunch of bald characters I couldn't tell apart, but when it boiled down to it, the real reason I hated it was because it wasn't ""Aliens."" 

""Alien 3"" was dark, it was different, but it was still part of the Alien series. It grew on me afterwards, with some of the best character/dramatic moments for me in the franchise, mostly quiet moments that I missed the first time. Like when Ripley sits to eat with the prisoners after Dillon tells her they're all rapists and murders of women. ""I must make you nervous then,"" she says and Dillon is impressed. The scene when she talks to Bishop, perfectly in character. ""I like your new haircut."" Every scene with Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister, back in the day), his performance as the doctor haunted by the deaths he caused while drunk. The scene in the EEV when Ripley learns she's carrying an alien, followed by the scene where she begs and then tries to provoke Dillon into killing her. 

There are tons of great scenes in Alien 3, a movie that got chopped to bits by a studio that wanted another ""Aliens."" The Assembly Cut as others have mentioned helps a lot. It restores a lot of dialogue, character and plot to a movie that got reduced to a bunch of spliced clips because the studio wanted to make a movie to appeal to people like me who wanted more Aliens. 

But as much as anything, I missed the theme of A3: loss. Everybody in the movie has lost everything dear to them. The prisoners their freedom. The doctor, his license and respect. Ripley, her friends. It's when I realized that the deaths of the other ""Aliens"" survivors made sense. It absolutely fit the tone and theme of the movie. 

But these broken people manage to band together to fight their common enemy. These people who shouldn't give a crap about anybody else become heroes, even if their motives aren't entirely heroic. Save the universe? That's Ripley's drive. Dillon just wants to save his men. How do they convince the rest of the cons to fight? Dillon's speech prior to the last battle, short as it was, is one of my favorites. ""You're all gonna die. The only question is how you check out. You want it on your feet? Or on your fucking knees, begging?""

I was wrong then. Alien 3, especially the Assembly Cut, is worthy of being part of the lineage of Alien. It's not a great movie, but it's a good *Alien* movie.  I wish David Fincher could have made the movie he wanted from the start.

""Resurrection,"" in my opinion is hot garbage. In fact, it was watching AR that made be go back and rewatch A3, and make me appreciate it as a film. No consistency with the Alien universe, a silly plot, nonsensical sci fi in a universe hundreds of years more advanced than the one established in Alien... But the worst part was that Ripley wasn't Ripley anymore. It was as bad as the Star Trek reboot movies. It might as well have been a completely new movie. To me, AR was a grim predictor of what was to become of the Alien franchise with Aliens vs Predator and the prequels.

I've come all the way around on A3. To me, it's the last good Alien film. Everything else has just been living off the corpse of the franchise.

Except for the game ""Alien Isolation"" - that to me is the unofficial Alien 4... (Or 1.5 in the Alien timeline.)

Issac Asimov - Many of his stories have a positive overall theme, even if the characters may do negative things. His theme is really that humanity will ultimately do ok, conquer the stars and solve all problems. 

A.E. Von Voght - Ok so he is pulpy and juvenile and most of his stories are wish fulfillment... But humans ar e smart and solve problems and do some pretty amazing things with atomic power...

1) Ana was put into hiding for her own protection and later adopted. (Following the trail of the case to the orphanage leads K to the memory he carries)

2) When her immune system issue manifested (whether this is down to her being a born replicant or a human/replicant hybrid is open to interpretation) her adoptive parents arranged the isolation dome for her before leaving for the off-world colonies. She does not know her parentage. (This is why Ana remains in the city)

3) There, isolated and nostalgic, she becomes adept at crafting memories and subcontracts to the Wallace Corporation. Their high quality results in them being widely used. (This is why K has her memories).

4) Part of what makes her memories so good is she pours part of herself into them. However, using *actual* memories is illegal. (This is why she later gives an evasive half-truth to K: she has broken the law)

5) Finding the body of Rachael is the first domino. K, like the other replicants, has carried Ana's memories around in his head all his life, all unaware. ""She makes the best memories."" (The case he is on and the memories he carries dovetail: any replicant Blade Runner that was on the same case could have gone down the same path. Which ties neatly to K's character arc where he discovers he isn't 'special' but realises his own worth and the worth of other replicants).

6) Joi is designed to tell her owner what they want to hear. ""Joi - Everything You Want"" says the AR billboard late in the film, undermining the seemingly supportive and loving relationship they appeared to have up until then. As the replicants say, they all want to be the born child, because to be born is to have a soul. (This is why Ana gives him the idea, because it's what he wants to hear).

I think that addresses your objections.

None of this is fan theory, this is all content explicitly in the film, though it doesn't handhold you through it. It's okay to have missed them, but you're dismissing what other people have seen explicitly as pure speculation.

Admittedly, there are coincidences at the heart of the film (as in many, many stories) and you can either find them plausible or not. But explicit explanations for some of your objections do exist in the film. Whether this 'fixes' it for you or not, that's another matter entirely.

Now, I've seen the film twice. On the first viewing, my girlfriend missed several of these plot points - I can see how some elements can fly under the radar of someone perfectly sharp.

Naam is such a skilled writer and the moral ambiguity he injects into the series is so well done that I honestly couldn’t tell whether or not the guy is pro collective consciousness or not. I kept waiting till I finished the series, hoping I’d be able to figure that out but, as I said... got distracted.

You can't win against an enemy that powerful. The resistance is a joke. And not because of their effort of skills, no, its because the enemy is simply too unstoppable.

Here is my guess: they are either human built AI the went out of control and took over and don't understand the humans that created them very well or they are in a computer simulation and all the humans are computer characters. Or the AI thinks its all a simulation and is trying to play the Earth like a game.

Thirdly, *if* a person found it annoying to distinguish info on the screen from movement behind the screen, they could simply fill the rest of the screen with a background color or texture. Then when the display is off it could be transparent.

Ultimately, I'm more interested in displays which simply don't require hardware. By that I mean a hologram or AR. The display simply appears floating in the air wherever it is convenient or needed, without the need for any kind of transparent hardware at all.

The best way to learn to read faster is to read more.  I would suggest short stories.  

Short stories are, well, short.  So even a slow reader won't usually lose track of early events before reaching the end - you will probably find that you can read the entire store in a single session.  They also tend to be paced ""quicker"" than novels, so the sense of action feels faster.  As you read more you will train yourself to read faster and with better comprehension and retention.

There are a lot of Star Trek books out there that are collections of short stories (and novellas - which ar longer than short stories but shorter than novels). Not sure about the other properties you mentioned as enjoying as I haven't read any books based on them.


Edit: added a list of ST short stories.

When I say fast, I mean fast. Like, there is no reasonable defense against an object heading towards you at near light speed. A crayola crayon (2 grams) at 99% the speed of light packs 2×10¹⁴ Joules of energy. 

One gram of TNT has about 4×10³ Joules of energy. So the equivalent amount of TNT when our crayon hits the earth is on the order of 8×10¹⁰ grams of TNT. 80 megatonnes. The largest nuke ever developed had 25 megatonnes (B41). 

Launching a crayola crayon wipes out major cities. Launching a 96 colour pack destroys the environment and instigated nuclear winter. Relativistic energy is no joke. God forbid you launch a few kilograms at a time - punch mountain sides holes in planets. A small asteroid cracks a planet in half. 

An incoming crayon at 0.99c is travelling at such high speeds that the light that it is pushing in front of it arrives only moments before it hits. There's no need for stealth. No radar system can detect something that small (it's cross section is smaller than radar wavelengths). You just die without warning.

The only defense is a satellite swarm which cuts off the entire view of the stars and lets no light in. This swarm needs to be several layers thick and moving erratically, or they just launch crayons in quick succession to punch through the holes. 

Basically, living on a planet gets you killed. There is no need to have infantry or tanks when your artillery wins the war in the first moment.

If someone who understands this better thinks I'm wrong then do correct me, but I *think* you'd have to move the Moon down to below geosynchronous orbit in order to have tidal drag actually lower the orbit rather than raise it. That way it's low enough that it moves overhead faster than the Earth below, so it's being constantly pulled back (and therefore lower) by the part of Earth it's passing over, rather than being dragged forward (and therefore outward) by it.

Geosynchronous orbit is a bit over 90% of the way down to Earth from Lunar orbit.

[],Slashycent,,,[],,,,text,t2_14o807,False,,"To me it made perfect sense. Mysterio is a con artist, all he does is an illusion. Let's look at his good-guy moments again: 

When it comes to his hero-role as Mysterio, now that was all fake, a total trick to make himself look like a hero, even endangering/hurting innocents in the process. Also: he was acting hilariously theatralical. Like I get it, there are such heroes in the MCU (Thor/Dr Strange etc) but that's exactly what Beck used to make people believe in his ""vengeful outer-world Power-Ranger""-role. People where so overwhelmed with heroes and villains and things that they never could've imagined to exist and the world was slowly trying to cope with the unimaginable being real (Science vs witches), it posed the perfect circumstances for someone like Mysterio to abuse and make people believe in something that's actually fake. Because who could really tell anymore after all that happened? 


Now his interpersonal relationship moments with Peter are a bit more complicated, but still make sense after the twist. Pretty much all of his alleged kindness was an act. Why? Because Beck was a sociopath who saw everyone around him as mere pawns for his main objective to become the ultimate ""hero"". He needed Peter to trust him, to look up to him, only that way he could've gained access to Starks AR-technology to make even better illusions and become even more of a ""hero"". That's why he groomed Peter, made him feel comfortable, acted like his cool step-dad. 

Now, Beck was insane and plotted his revenge ever since Stark took his technology and fired him, but he wasn't a monster and I think he might've actually started to like Peter a bit. At least to a degree where he tried to make him leave the whole super-hero business behind and be a regular kid again. See? He was seemingly nice and interested, but in the end all he did was try to get Peter out of his way. And once Peter didn't give up and start to pose a threat to his main objective, Beck lost it. He was done trying to play good cop with Peter, it was time for going bad cop and getting rid of that damn spider before his entire plan would collapse. And when that eventually happened and everything he worked for became pointless and nothing mattered anymore, he delivered one final blow to Peter, one last revenge, by framing him as a bad guy. 

He didn't ""go crazy in a matter of seconds"", he was always a vengeful bad guy, ever since he was fired. He just tricked everyone in the beginning and as soon as he started to loose control his true colours came showing more and more. 

Now Mysterio _is_ a good character. He's just plain evil. But villains can be complex too and I do think that Beck's motive/plan/worlview were highly interesting and relevant in today's time. People need something to believe in and these days they believe in everything. Who can tell the real from the fake anymore? Does authenticity still exist? Who even wants to pursue the truth anymore and who wants to be fooled? Sometimes a good lie can be a thousand times more pleasant than reality. But it's still a lie. 


Great motive, great character, great acting by Gyllenhaal.

[],Psyava,,,[],,,,text,t2_36b9plej,False,,"**7/10.**

**IMO** It wasn't as good as Homecoming, but definitely much better than Captain Marvel and most definitely better than the Amazing Spider-Man films, would recommend to MCU fans and maybe Spider-Man fans. However, there are quite a few problems with the movie:

- **Plot Holes**: Edith/Protocols would have been very useful during Endgame... guess that didn't exist though during that time... was that just for convenience? Also, the whole 'blip'/5 year skip thing with everybody seems completely normal and society is working 100% as it used to be now.. how did that fix so quickly?
- **Too many Avengers references**: Listen, it's nice and all, but I wish they were more subtle like in the previous films, there was a reference to them coming up every 10 - 15 minutes, the movie can try to hype people up, but it doesn't work on me.
- **Stark Tech ruins Spider-Man**: Spider-Man has access to overpowered shit now and pretty much now needs zero of his own science skills to do anything now... okay I guess...
- **Relationship with Discount Mary Jane is kinda cute... but weird and rushed at the same time**: Nothing much to add here besides to ask the question why Peter gets his web-shooter up for MJ all of a sudden, he gave 0 shits about her in the last movie now he starts talking about his love for her in the first moment of the movie... felt like it could have done better.
- **First half of the movie feels more like a near boring teenage love drama then a proper Spider-Man film**: It feels pretty down to Earth in the first half I'll give it that, but things get better once Mysterio unveils his true intentions, the best parts imo were when Mysterio messes around with Peter for the first time with the AR and J.J.J. showing up in the end. But, I hated how Peter's identity was revealed to everyone at the end, which really ruined it. Overall/**TL;DR**, it takes a while for the movie to start to pick up but eventually gets into some good stuff.

So yeah, there were only a handful of parts I enjoyed (which I pointed out to some above).

[Here](https://youtu.be/vydILDfxEnU?t=71) is a video testing various silencers rated for 9mm using a Glock 17 with a ~5in threaded barrel and sub-sonic ammunition.

I can and do appreciate older movies but, like post-2000 movies, I can admit their IMDB ratings are very skewed, just for a different reason. The types of people who will bother to watch, and then rate, those older movies tend to overrate them. 

Most movies before about the mid-1960s are really only worthwhile to modern audiences if they have an 8.0 or higher, unless you're really into older movies or a certain actor. There are some exceptions, but most people are going to be disappointed with most older films below an 8 unless you have an appreciation for the era.

And post-2000 dramas and comic book movies are pretty much the same--it really needs at least a 7.5 for it to hold up. 

On the other hand, comedies, horror films, and non-superhero action movies since the 1960s can be quite good in the 6's. 

Romancing The Stone, An American Tail, Scream, and Mars Attacks all have IMDB ratings at 6.9 or lower, for example, and I think many moviegoers would get more out of them than they would out of older dramas like The African Queen or Father Goose, or modern dramas like Margin Call or The Social Network or superhero movies like the 2004 Spiderman 2, despite all those movies being in the 7's or higher.",1569797572,{},f1xfczo,False,t3_daybe8,False,True,t1_f1x709v,/r/movies/comments/daybe8/please_dont_rate_a_film_you_havent_yet_seen_on/f1xfczo/,1569807850.0,0,True,[],False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each technical revolution should be aiming to solve some kind of problem and fulfil some kind of need consumers haven't realised yet. For example, like touchscreens in the case of mobiles/smartphones. For gaming, hardware specs and cost is a barrier for many people to enjoying games at high graphical quality; ideally, streaming would enable one to experience games at optimum quality without shelling out too much. 

It's possible that streaming could be more economical if you're just a casual gamer as well. This makes sense if you only tend to complete/play a game once but have no incentive to replay it again. Or if you don't play games very consistently. Either way, time not spent playing games is kind of a waste if you've already invested the money into the hardware. 

But like VR/AR it's not without it's challenges.

IMO they don't see the forest for the trees with a lot of these things. The core gameplay loop that was addicting and fun isn't super hard to replicate, but you have to preserve it and add to it meaningfully, if you want to keep your footing.

2 had the most class variety of any CoD game. Snipers could hole up and camp with scaveneger claymores, but they could be killed by lightweights sprinting past the claymores, or flashbangs disabling them, or even tubing their camping window. 

You could run and gun, or you could hunker down and LMG people at a choke point. You could do any mix thereof - all were equally strong and valid, even if some (Danger close /oma/scavenger tubes, sprint knifing) were gimmicky and unfun to play against.

Starting in 3, they basically decided sniping isn't fun to play against, and gutted all of a sniper's defense tools. They gutted last stand and it's associated perks, making run and gun kits weaker. They made lines of sight short, and made it hard to camp or hold any location, nerfing LMGs into the ground.

Map design, and perk design, all conspired to make the game 100% about running with an AR or SMG.  They removed stopping power and killstreak stacking, so you were always best off taking the low-end streak perks and never going for broke on a chopper or ac-130. Even if you got a high-end perk, everyone took the perk that makes them invisible to killstreaks, since Stopping Power was removed. 

It went from a game with endless variety and replayability to a game where you run around with an assault rifle all game. It went from a game where Everything Was Broken in a big game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock to a game where nothing was broken, but everyone was essentially the same.

I think if they do legalize every drug the hard shit like crack etc. If your caught on it outside first offense $200 fine and day/night in the drunk tank. Increasing exponentially. If caught driving first offense loss of license for 6 months/1 year. Again increasing exponentially until your third strike. There is a huge amount of taxes to be collected from legalizing drugs.

I agree with some points of you gun opinions as well i think it's weird you have to be 21 to own a pistol if you buy from a dealership but can buy a ar-15 at 18 sure the pistol is easier to conceal but a sawn off shotgun is just as easy and more deadly and if your gonna harm someone with a weapon i doubt you care if they tack on owning a illegal firearm onto murder/attempted murder. 
The thing about medical evaluation is most people could fake being mentally ill or not ill and those laws maybe not potentially this one make you guilty until proven innocent which in usa is a direct violation of the Constitution.

Yes, you can. Just do a private purchase and find someone that will sell you one without a background check. You're only breaking the law if you get caught and since there is no penalty for private sales without a background check in most states and no gun registration anyone can have almost any gun and never get in any trouble unless a cop catches them with it.

Here's the thing: When was the last time your home got searched by a cop?  If you're most people, including mass shooters, the answer is *never*.

On mental health, no, they aren't doing a damn thing.  

At the very least they'll start locking up people who publicly claim they are going to go on a rampage but most people who actually go on a rampage don't warn anyone. They just do it and they take steps to hide their plans.

If a cop pulls over a guy with duct tape, a shovel, heavy rubber gloves, rope, bleach and heavy black trash bags in his back seat, he's going to be suspicious as fuck.

If a Texas cop pulls over a non-felon with an AR-15, body armor, tactical gear and a thousand rounds of ammunition, that's just a red blooded American.

See the problem? There is no ""predicting"" a mass shooting, you have to literally wait for them to tell you they're going to do it. And if someone actually does, they were probably lying to get attention anyway.

Did you know a mentally retarded person can own a gun in America?  As in, an adult with the mind of a 4 year old.  A schizophrenic? No problem.  A *blind-man?*  No problem. Hell, if he can even hit the target then put that shit on youtube and start working on getting him a concealed carry permit. Surely a person's care taker 

Our gun laws make no fucking sense.

You have to get a permit to sell beer, that includes a background check. You have to pass a test to be a lifeguard.  You have to pass a background check to work at a public library. You have to get a license to deal cards in a casino. You have to get licensed to open a food truck slinging burritos.

Season 1: The Forging of the Rings of Power

Season 2: The War of the Elves and Sauron

Season 3: The Fall of Numenor

Season 4: The Rise of Sauron

Season 5: The Last Alliance of Elves and Men

&amp;#x200B;

Season 1: 

The season opens in a similar way to 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. An epic battle between the forces of the Valar and the forces of Melkor during the War of Wrath. It establishes Sauron's origins, and showcases some of the senior Elven Commanders such as Gil-Galad, Cirdan, Oropher, Galadirel, Elrond, Etc. It also shows the establishment of Numenor and the beginning of the Numenorian line of kings starting with Elros taking the name of Tar-Minyatur. Sauron is only shown wearing a mask 

There is a timeskip in the first episode and it flashes forward to 1500 years later, showing that Numenor has become a great power, but rife with gluttony and greed. Its' people are powerful but have grown complacent and used to the luxury they have enjoyed for a millennia. The populace of Numenor doesnt even really know if the Valar exist, and some believe that the Ban of the Valar is just a myth, that there's nothing on the other side of the ocean. We're introduced to its' noble king, Ar-Pharazon and his ruling council. The Council is composed of his chief sorcerer (let's call him Doug), Elendil, his first son; Isildur, and various other lords and ladies. Elendil and Isildur are to be portrayed as huge dickheads, if not outright evil. The audience is meant to be on the side of Ar-Pharazon, his queen, and his chief lieutenant/sorcerer Doug, and to mistrust Elendil and his house. Elendil gets a redemption arc over the course of the series.

Next, we're introduced to Celebribor, master smith of the elves. He has just finished forging the Three Elven Rings of Power to solidify Elven power in Middle-Earth and protect them from Numenor's encroachment. Meanwhile, a young (for an elf) Elf named Annatar arrives in Eregion and realizes what Celebrimbor has made and decides to get close to him to learn his secrets.

The first episode needs to establish the animosity between Elves and Men. It needs to show that they are far from unified and while the Elves have the power, the men of Middle Earth are more numerous, and Numenor is the most powerful of all. 

Over the course of the season, you have politics and intrigue while establishing there is rot in both Numenorian and Elven Societies. The Rings of Power are forged, and you see Annatar gaining Celebrimbor's trust as they forge the Nine and the Seven. 

The first season ends with Annatar betraying Celebrimbor by forging the One Ring and revealing himself as Sauron. It ends with the distribution of the Nine and the Seven. The Seven are shown in a montage being given to various Dwarven Lords while the Nine are distributed amongst the rulers of Men. We see Easterlings from Rhun, Wainriders from Khand and Southrons from Near and Far Harad. We see him corrupt the Numenorian Lord of Umbar, but the stinger of the season is that we see the Chief Sorcerer of Numenor, Doug put on a ring and reveal himself to be a disciple of Sauron. Eventually he becomes the Witch-King and the leader of the Nazgul. 

&amp;#x200B;

Season 2: 

Basically this season is all about the forces of Sauron running roughshod over the Elven forces in Middle Earth. Elrond is dispatched to Numenor to beg for Numenorean assistance, but Doug councils the king against intervening in the wars of the elves, playing on the prejudice that the king has for the elves. Elendil argues against this and says they should immediately come to the aid of the Elves. The season ends with the siege of Lindon, where the Elven army has been pushed back and all hope seems to be lost. Then, Elendil and the forces of Numenor arrive and win the day. Sauron, seeing his forces in retreat, knows he is beaten and surrenders to the Numenoreans and is brought back to numenor in chains.

""I have every right to be annoyed""

""especially if you are a writer employed by the industry you might find it hard to make anything at all""

Yea. Writing about crippling children, incest, rape, murder, torture etc... Its hard because of marketing, executive vision and so much more. These guys got every writer in the industries dream. Write a fantastic story with almost no limit, a huge budget and faith from the creator. 

They were offered more time and episodes to flesh out the show and they said no.

 they contrdicted THEIR OWN WORK directly after the epsodes aired. 

Their is no obligation to be entertained. Yes. You are right and thats the only logical and correct thing you have said. HOWEVER when you are the same people that put care into pointless scenes like Tywin Lannister drying ink to Brienn just closing a book on wet ink Fans ABSOLUTELY have every right to complain. There is so muchbwrong with season 8 caused by problems from season 7 even. 

I mean for fucks sake. the iron islands vote using a democracy and the person from the iron islands laughed at the idea of democracy. This isnt some stupid brain dead conclusion like ""not everything will be crowd pleasing moments"" 

That is laziness. 

we are not talking about ""a difficult job"" we are not talking about ""not being able to please fans"" We are talking about a show quality that took such a hit with so many rushed points that its a mockery of what it once was. It rejected its own lore. Its own fore shadowing. Its own rules. Its own attention to detail. 

Symbolism thrown in your face to the point it felt like a basket ball hit it. The show was always more subtle in approach. (Dany dragon wing shot for example)

Anyone who has ever seen a movie would tell you ""if two warriors lock eyes more than once on a battle field they should fight. (Jon snow had met  eyes with the night king a few times)

This is so much more than ""Disapointed fans"" This is a pure fucking joke. filled with lazy shortcuts, incompetent storytelling and complete disregard for their own universe.

Im sorry but these guy dont get the ""You cant please everyone"" defense and they certainly dont have the right to ""Writing is hard"" what they had the biggest free pass in writing almost anyone on tv has ever had.

They boasted about ""Studying Helms deep"" or some shit from lord of the rings for the final battle and that had les military competance that children smashing their actions figures together. Worse yet. Thats  exactly what they did. Smashed an army into their main characters.

these two people are not 100% deserving of every harsh criticsm. One of these guys is the one who made dead pool with no mouth and ar blades. These people incompent writers who should have no right to go near star wars.

I could go on. I mean this when I say. I know bad tv. I gave up writing so i know how hard it is to please people, executivs etc. I have defended the worst series that have gotten pitiful reviews and fan reception. I like entertainment others find horrid because of amateur writing or directing. I wqtched things where it recoreded with cheap video recorders.

This. season 8 of game of thrones. this was by far the worst, most lazy, under developed show I have ever fucking seen. I have never seen a show fail so bad. I have  never seen such disregard for a work in my entire life. This would be the example I show to people about how NOT to write tv.

Walt returns to Albequerque and sets up his plot to kill the Nazis who killed Hank and Gomey and ruined his life, tying up some loose ends in the process.

The Sopranos ending is infamous too, the final cut to black. It's still discussed to this day. Did Tony die? Is it an allegory for him always having to look over his back? Is it just the TV show leaving him? The whole final scene is edited very particularly, different from the rest of the show.

Walt's is cathartic. He accomplishes his goal. He's not just the best cook of all time. We can even go back and look at him as a teacher, he made Jesse into an excellent cook and taught him well - fulfilling that aspect of his life. He killed all his enemies. He saved Jesse one last time. Ultimately, he died around the stuff that elevated his life and reason for living.",1557828079,{},eng4cfq,False,t3_bofp1i,False,True,t3_bofp1i,/r/television/comments/bofp1i/what_is_the_best_tv_series_finale_in_your_opinion/eng4cfq/,1557828089.0,32,True,,False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,,,,1558610746.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

,TheAsian1nvasion,,,[],,,,text,t2_er5hv,False,,"As a Tolkien fan I’m WAY more excited for this series now. If they can get Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler to reprise that would be sweet. 

There’s a lot of rich story to tell and if they’re interested in telling it I’m in. Way better than retreading the story already executed perfectly by Jackson in the first three films. 

Season 1 -a young apprentice named Annatar comes to Eregion to  study under the tutelage of Celebrimbor the last of the great House of Fëanor. King Gil-Galad and the elves are squabbling with division and  mistrust the Numenoreans who have begun to settle in middle earth. Elrond,  Galadriel, Círdan, Celebrimbor and Oropher make up the High Elven lords. Oropher and Círdan are kind of dicks, they don’t trust Men and chafe under the rule of Gil-Galad. Elrond is new (in Elven terms) to the council and is fiercely loyal to Gil-Galad. 
We see the greatness of Númenor, ruled by the King Ar-Pharazôn along with his court, including his cousin Elendil. Elendil’s son Isildur is an idealistic, goodhearted teenager. Minas Anor, Osgiliath and Minas Ithil are still young cities. There are other lords that can be characters and have personality but they don’t have to be characters that currently exist. Ar-Pharazôn is portrayed as a good king but it’s widespread opinion in Númenor that the ban of the Valar is unfair and many Numenoreans don’t even believe the Valar exist. Ar-Pharazôn’s most trusted adviser is his sorcerer. I can’t think of a name for him but let’s call him Doug. He is portrayed to be an extremely noble and trustworthy guy. Elendil is portrayed as resenting his cousin and wanting the throne for himself. (The producers should set him up for a redemption arc). Doug is portrayed as the good guy helping a good king. Elendil distrusts Doug. 

The basis of the first season will feature political intrigue amongst the Elves and the Numenoreans, reinforcing the fact that both are great powers who mistrust each other. All the while, Annatar and Celebrimbor are working on a secret project, the rings of power that will reinforce the rulers of Men, Dwarves and Elves. 

Intrigues and ups and downs ensue for the first season. Orcs are gathering in Mordor and the Misty Mountains, so the elves and the men of Gondor begin to worry. 

The season ends with Annatar betraying Celebrimbor and stealing the 7 dwarven rings and the nine rings of men. The season ends with Celebrimbor forging the three Elven rings while the seven and the nine are distributed amongst Dwarven  lords and kings of men. We see Easterlings, Haradrim and the rulers of Umbar, Khand and Rhûn being given rings of power. The final ring is given to Ar-Pharazôn’s trusted lieutenant; Doug. The stinger shows Annatar being revealed as Sauron and the forging of the One Ring.

We would probably just see the end of second Age, with Annatar scheming to make the rings and a parallel Scheming and turmoil in Numenor (season 1).

Eventually (season 2) Annatar succeeds in forging the ring and the war Breaks out.  In the last episode Numenorians under tar-Minastir land and parallel narratives merge.

The season 3 is about the war from that point on, and ends in temporary retreats of Sauron.

Then we time skip to Ar-Pharazon era, probably, if show is still successful. We would need new actors for humans, but many elves and Sauron stay the same. The down all of Numenor (season 4) and war of last alliance (season 5) then follow.  The series end with Isildur cutting off Sauron's finger and bringing us back to first scene of Lord of the Rings.


If the show still successful, they can go Angmar wars (season 6).

In that time the fleets of the Númenóreans darkened the sea upon the west of the land, and they were like an archipelago of a thousand isles; their masts were as a forest upon the mountains, and their sails like a brooding cloud; and their banners were golden and black. And all things waited upon the word of Ar-Pharazôn; and Sauron withdrew into the inmost circle of the Temple, and men brought him victims to be burned.

Then the Eagles of the Lords of the West came up out of the dayfall, and they were arrayed as for battle, advancing in a line the end of which diminished beyond sight; and as they came their wings spread ever wider, grasping the sky. But the West burned red behind them, and they glowed beneath, as though they were lit with a flame of great anger, so that all Númenor was illumined as with a smouldering fire; and men looked upon the faces of their fellows, and it seemed to them that they were red with wrath.

Then Ar-Pharazôn hardened his heart, and he went aboard his mighty ship, Alcarondas, Castle of the Sea. Many-oared it was and many-masted, golden and sable; and upon it the throne of Ar-Pharazôn was set. Then he did on his panoply and his crown, and let raise his standard, and he gave the signal for the raising of the anchors; and in that hour the trumpets of Númenor outrang the thunder.

Thus the fleets of the Númenóreans moved against the menace of the West; and there was little wind, but they had many oars and many strong slaves to row beneath the lash. The sun went down, and there came a great silence. Darkness fell upon the land, and the sea was still, while the world waited for what should betide. Slowly the fleets passed out of the sight of the watchers in the havens, and their lights faded, and night took them; and in the morning they were gone. For a wind arose in the east and it wafted them away; and they broke the Ban of the Valar, and sailed into forbidden seas, going up with war against the Deathless, to wrest from them everlasting life within the Circles of the World.

But the fleets of Ar-Pharazôn came up out of the deeps of the sea and encompassed Avallónë and all the isle of Eressëa, and the Eldar mourned, for the light of the setting sun was cut off by the cloud of the Númenóreans. And at last Ar-Pharazôn came even to Aman, the Blessed Realm, and the coasts of Valinor; and still all was silent, and doom hung by a thread. For Ar-Pharazôn wavered at the end, and almost he turned back. His heart misgave him when he looked upon the soundless shores and saw Taniquetil shining, whiter than snow, colder than death, silent, immutable, terrible as the shadow of the light of Ilúvatar. But pride was now his master, and at last he left his ship and strode upon the shore, claiming the land for his own, if none should do battle for it. And a host of the Númenóreans encamped in might about Túna, whence all the Eldar had fled.

Then Manwë upon the Mountain called upon Ilúvatar, and for that time the Valar laid down their government of Arda. But Ilúvatar showed forth his power, and he changed the fashion of the world; and a great chasm opened in the sea between Númenor and the Deathless Lands, and the waters flowed down into it, and the noise and smoke of the cataracts went up to heaven, and the world was shaken. And all the fleets of the Númenóreans were drawn down into the abyss, and they were drowned and swallowed up for ever. But Ar-Pharazôn the King and the mortal warriors that had set foot upon the land of Aman were buried under falling hills: there it is said that they lie imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten, until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom.

But the land of Aman and Eressëa of the Eldar were taken away and removed beyond the reach of Men for ever. And Andor, the Land of Gift, Númenor of the Kings, Elenna of the Star of Eärendil, was utterly destroyed. For it was nigh to the east of the great rift, and its foundations were overturned, and it fell and went down into darkness, and is no more. And there is not now upon Earth any place abiding where the memory of a time without evil is preserved. For Ilúvatar cast back the Great Seas west of Middle-earth, and the Empty Lands east of it, and new lands and new seas were made; and the world was diminished, for Valinor and Eressëa were taken from it into the realm of hidden things.

In an hour unlocked for by Men this doom befell, on the nine and thirtieth day since the passing of the fleets. Then suddenly fire burst from the Meneltarma, and there came a mighty wind and a tumult of the earth, and the sky reeled, and the hills slid, and Númenor went down into the sea, with all its children and its wives and its maidens and its ladies proud; and all its gardens and its halls and its towers, its tombs and its riches, and its jewels and its webs and its things painted and carven, and its lore: they vanished for ever. And last of all the mounting wave, green and cold and plumed with foam, climbing over the land, took to its bosom Tar-Míriel the Queen, fairer than silver or ivory or pearls. Too late she strove to ascend the steep ways of the Meneltarma to the holy place; for the waters overtook her, and her cry was lost in the roaring of the wind"".",1551978430,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ei07sb7,,t3_ayd4mn,,True,t3_ayd4mn,/r/television/comments/ayd4mn/amazon_prime_announces_that_their_lord_of_the/ei07sb7/,1551978431.0,1,True,,False,television,t5_2qh6e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Numenoreans lived in an island in the sea, having been given it as a reward by Iluvatar (basically God) for their help in the War of Wrath against Morgoth (basically Satan) at the end of the First Age. After the war, they were gifted long life by one of the more powerful Maiar (spirits/angels on the level of Gandalf, Saruman, Sauron, the Balrogs etc.).

As the Second Age wore on, Sauron found his way to Numenor and poisoned the mind of its king. The Valar (demigods) had forbidden the Numenoreans from sailing westward of their island, in the fear that Men would come across the Undying Lands. But the king Ar-Pharazon, under Sauron's influence, started worshipping Morgoth and eventually built a huge fleet to sail west. He made landfall and marched on the capital, but the Valar called upon Iluvatar, and He changed the world. Ar-Pharazon and his army were sealed in caves until the end of the world, and Numenor itself was sunk beneath the sea.

Isildur was one of the ones who fled to Middle Earth, where his father founded the twin kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. Then Sauron (who had escaped death in the destruction of Numenor) came to Middle Earth and established himself in Mordor, only to be defeated by the Last Alliance.

In that case they'll work with you to see what is reasonable to find, ""Three beds and a garage is going to be tricky.  We might find that in another town, though two beds and a garage or three beds is reasonable.""

In parallel you'll get pre-approved for a mortgage if you need one.  This is a bank saying ""If what you told me is true I'll give you a loan.""

When you find a place you put in an offer as well as some earnest money (term may be a bit off).  This is a small piece, usually a couple hundred, that goes towards your down payment.  Your offer depends on a lot of terms, and is where a realtor can help if it's not a standard transaction.  Usually you have a series of ""outs"" such as ""house has to pass inspection, my loan has to be approved, and I need a buyer for my current place."". If any of those fail you get your money back, if you fail to do what's needed from you they keep that money.

Once that's all squared away you get the bank to approve your loan.  Usually that's just them running a credit report and taking documentation about your income.  They'll usually do an appraisal on the house, and you'll have an appraisal clause in your offer.  That's just to ensure you don't spend $250k on a place that's worth $175k.  Appraisals are no big deal as if the house comes in under you just go back to the seller and say ""hey, appraisal came in at X, I can't get a mortgage at Y price, but I'll be happy to buy it at X.""

Next comes the purchase and sale agreement and more money into escrow.  The P&amp;S is the contract that details specifically what you're buying and sets a date for the actual sale.  It's a terribly boring document full of legalize.

On the sale day you meet at a town building, mine was the registry of deeds, with your lawyers.  You spend about 15 minutes signing a ton of documents, the lawyers leave to file the paperwork, and you get a set of keys to your new home.

That's how it worked in my state (MA).  Might change slightly depending on your state but I've been told it's about the same everywhere in the US.

Oh, and around the time you finalize your mortgage you setup insurance.  They usually work with your mortgage provider so that the cost is added to your mortgage and the bank pays the mortgage company.  Bit of a win-win as you only need to pay one bill and the bank requires you to keep a certain amount of coverage to keep your loan (if something happens and the place is lost they want to make sure they still get paid).",1569797285,{},f1xeio0,False,t3_dau1vp,False,True,t1_f1wcbhy,/r/television/comments/dau1vp/for_20_years_house_hunters_has_been_reliable/f1xeio0/,1569807440.0,2,True,[],False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],MadRhetoric04,,,[],,,,text,t2_x3jj5,False,[],"Well, since you started off by insulting gun owners without knowing them And think the military would wipe out an insurgency despite centuries of proof otherwise, let me leave this copypasta for you. 

Try being a bit more empathetic next time:

The copy/pasta I wrote for whenever this comes up.

I see this a lot and I've addressed it in bits and pieces but I want to fully put this nonsense to bed.

Let's take a look at just raw numbers. The entire United States military (including clerks, nurses, generals, cooks, etc) is 1.2 million. Law enforcement is estimated at about 1.1 million (again, including clerks and other non-officers.)  This gives us a combined force of 2.3 million people who could potentially be tapped to deal with a civil insurrection. Keep in mind this also includes officers who serve in the prisons, schools, and other public safety positions that require their presence. That total of soldiers is also including US soldiers deployed to the dozens of overseas US bases in places like South Korea, Japan, Germany, etc. Many of those forces are considered vital and can't be removed due to strategic concerns.

But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that the state slaps a rifle in every filing clerk's hand and tells them to sort the situation out.

We now have to contend with the fact that many law enforcement and military personnel consider themselves patriots and wouldn't necessarily just automatically side with the state if something were to happen. There is a very broad swath of people involved in these communities that have crossover with militia groups and other bodies that are, at best, not 100% in support of the government. Exact numbers are hard to pin down but suffice it to say that not everybody would be willing to snap-to if an insurrection kicked off. Even if they didn't outright switch sides there's the very real possibility that they could, in direct or indirect ways, work against their employer's prosecution of the counter-insurgency either by directly sabotaging operations or just not putting as much effort into their work and turning a blind eye to things.

But, again, for the sake of argument, let's assume that you've somehow managed to talk every single member of the military and law enforcement services into being 100% committed to rooting out the rebel scum.

There are an estimated 400 million firearms in the US. Even if we just ignore 300 million firearms available as maybe they're antiques or not in a condition to be used, that's still 100 million firearms that citizens can pick up and use. Let's go even further than that and say of that 100, there are only about 20 million firearms that are both desirable and useful in an insurgency context and not say .22's or double barrelled shotguns.

It should be noted just for the sake of interest that several million AR-15's are manufactured every year and have been since 2004 when the ""assault weapons"" ban ended. Soooo 2-5 million per year for 15 years....

If only 2% of the US population decided ""Fuck it, let's dance!"" and rose up, that's about 6.5 million people. You're already outnumbering all law enforcement and the military almost 3 to 1. And you have enough  weapons to arm them almost four times over. There are millions of tons of ammunition held in private hands and the materials to make ammunition are readily available online even before you start talking about reloading through scrounging.

So you have a well equipped armed force that outnumbers the standing military and law enforcement capabilities of the country by a significant margin.

""But the military has tanks, planes, and satellites!""

That they do however it's worth noting that the majority of the capabilities of our armed forces are centered around engaging another state in a war. That means another entity that also has tanks, planes, and satellites. That is where the majority of our warfighting capabilities are centered because that's what conflict has consisted of for most of the 20th century.

We've learned a lot about asymmetric warfare since our time in Iraq and Afghanistan and one of the key takeaways has been just having tanks and battleships is not enough to win against even a much smaller and more poorly armed opponent.

A battleship or a bomber is great if you're going after targets that you don't particularly care about but they don't do you a whole hell of a lot of good when your targets are in an urban setting mixed in with people that you, the commander, are accountable to.

Flattening a city block is fine in Overthereastan because you can shrug and call the sixty civilians you killed ""collateral damage"" and no one gives a shit. If you do that here, you seriously damage perceptions about you among the civilians who then are going to get upset with you. Maybe they manage to bring enough political pressure on you to get you ousted, maybe they start helping the rebels, or maybe they pick up guns of their own and join in. You killed fifteen fighters in that strike but in so doing you may have created thirty more.

Even drones are of mixed utility in that circumstance. It's also worth noting that the US is several orders of magnitude larger than the areas that drones have typically operated in during conflict in the Middle East. And lest we forget, these drones are not exactly immune from attacks. There's also not a lot a drone can do in places with large amounts of tree cover...like over a billion acres of the US.

And then even if we decide that it's worth employing things like Hellfire missiles and cluster bombs, it should be noted that a strategy of ""bomb the shit out of them"" didn't work in over a decade in the Middle East. Most of the insurgent networks in the region that were there when the war started are still there and still operating, even if their influence is diminished they are still able to strike targets.

Just being able to bomb the shit out of someone doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to win in a conflict against them.

Information warfare capabilities also don't guarantee success. There are always workarounds and methods that are resistant to interception and don't require a high level of technical sophistication. Many commercial solutions can readily be used or modified to put a communications infrastructure in place that is beyond the reach of law enforcement or the military to have reliable access to. Again, there are dozens of non-state armed groups that are proving this on a daily basis.

You also have to keep in mind the psychological factor. Most soldiers are ok with operating in foreign countries where they can justify being aggressive towards the local population; they're over here, my people are back home. It's a lot harder to digest rolling down the streets of cities in your own country and pointing guns at people you may even know.

What do you do as a police officer or soldier when you read that soldiers opened fire into a crowd of people in your home town and killed 15? What do you do when you've been ordered to break down the door of a neighbor that you've known your whole life and arrest them or search their home? What do you do if you find out a member of your own family has been working with the insurgency and you have a professional responsibility to turn them in even knowing they face, at best, a long prison sentence and at worst potential execution? What do you do when your friends, family, and community start shunning you as a symbol of a system that they're starting to see more and more as oppressive and unjust?

""People couldn't organize on that scale!""

This is generally true. Even with the networked communications technologies that we have it's likely ideological and methodological differences would prevent a mass army of a million or more from acting in concert.

In many ways, that's part of what would make an insurrection difficult to deal with. Atomized groups of people, some as small as five or six, would be a nightmare to deal with because you have to take each group of fighters on its own. A large network can be brought down by attacking its control nodes, communication channels, and key figures.

Hundreds of small groups made up of five to twenty people all acting on their own initiative with different goals, values, and methods of operation is a completely different scenario and a logistical nightmare. It's a game of whack-a-mole with ten thousand holes and one hammer. Lack of coordination means even if you manage to destroy, infiltrate, or otherwise compromise one group you have at best removed a dozen fighters from the map. Attacks would be random and spontaneous, giving you little to no warning and no ability to effectively preempt an attack.

Negotiation isn't really an option either. Deals you cut with one group won't necessarily be honored by another and while you can leverage and create rivalries between the groups to a certain extent you can only do this by acknowledging some level of control and legitimacy that they possess. You have to give them some kind of legitimacy if you want to talk to them, the very act of talking says ""You are worth talking to."" And there are hundreds, if not thousands, of these groups.

You are, in effect, trying to herd cats who not only have no interest in listening to you but are actively dedicated to frustrating your efforts and who greatly outnumber you in an environment that prevents the use of the tools that your resources are optimized to employ.

Would it be bad? Definitely. Casualties would be extremely high on all sides. That's not a scenario I would ever want to see play out. It would be a long, drawn out war of attrition that the actual US government couldn't effectively win. Think about the Syrian Civil War or The Troubles in Northern Ireland or the Soviet-Afghan War in Afghanistan.

An example of this I see is the Dem primaries talking about outlawing AR-15s and that somehow leading to no more mass shootings. I see that as a direct comparison of the law/gun/murder since they appear to argue ""law = no more murder"".

With all of the Mueller Report findings, those put the different committees to work to see if they could independently back up Mueller's findings and if they too met obstruction that's additional charges.  

So it makes sense to go through the process and not rush it.

But with the Ukraine issue - there's so little gray area to it.

Rudy was vocal about it in MAY this year - But Rudy is just some crazy maybe lawyer with nebulous ties to the administration. He also says pretty much anything. 

Then Trump personally tells his acting Chief of Staff to withhold Congressionally approved funds before he calls the President of Ukraine.  This shows **Premeditation and Intent.**

Then supposedly the call which he uses coded language as best as he can, replacing ""Investigate the Biden Family"" with ""Corruption"" which is a Putin tactic, he still presses it something like 8 times according to some reports.  And the Intelligence agency sees this as so alarming that one of them turns into a Whistleblower.

[The Whistleblower may even be Dan Coats.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/9-questions-about-the-trump-whistleblower-complaint-answered/ar-AAHBw7l)

However it's over a month AFTER the call that the whistleblower news starts heating up and then on September 11th, Trump finally releases the funds to Ukraine. 

So that's all worthy of normal investigation, but Trump's admin refused to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress and that is straight up not allowed. There is no leeway there. Zero.

On top of that, Trump trying to probably get ahead of the story just admits to the meat of it.  Yes he did ask the President of Ukraine to investigate the Biden family (Joe Biden being the front runner for the next election, and Trump being on the campaign trail already, this is a clear campaign finance violation.)  

It's also Extortion.

But Trump waffles as he does and tries to turn and say that the UN is costing the United States money and such which is sort of new. His old complaints were about NATO which Ukraine isn't a part of. 

And Trump's IG has seen the whistleblower complaint and said it's credible.

This is basic cornerstone knowledge that is even required in order to get US citizenship, so rather than permitting them to waste his court's time so egregiously again, I'd be tempted to suggest the judge inform the defense that he'll ignore any future civics-related argument they attempt to bring, until such a time as they can demonstrate the ability to pass the citizenship or other basic civics test... except, of course, that would be bad, so he'll just have to write them a stern response instead.",1569797910,{},f1xg7gx,False,t3_dayp9t,False,True,t1_f1xcii9,/r/news/comments/dayp9t/mississippi_police_officers_fatally_shot_a_man_in/f1xg7gx/,1569808278.0,1,True,[],False,news,t5_2qh3l,0.0,1569799146.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],BrainPicker3,,,[],,,,text,t2_os5rv,False,[],"My first argument is not that people should not follow laws, though I think the laws are set up in a way to be intentionally broken and hard to immigrate unless you are wealthy.

My skepticism of people claiming they are  ""all for legal immigration"" but only against people breaking the rules. When they themselves dont seem to disagree with making it even more difficult to legally immigrate. Immigration is a complex topic and I think a lot of people would feel differently if they knew exactly how lengthy , expensive, and beaurocratic the current process is.

For example, my ex came here when she was 15 and was legally adopted by a US citizen. With this she was able to go to public school and obtain her driver's license. Though through an incompetency with her lawyer and paperwork, her green card application had two filings, one from when she was 15 and another when she was 17. The rules state you can only be granted a green card If you file this way (through adoption) before you are 16. The refilling essentially erased the original one. She hired another lawyer to try and get the original date pushed back to the first one to no avail.

All in all this cost her a little over $12,000 from her own pocket, 4 years of court hearing, and she was still denied her green card. Her only legal channels now are marriage and having a spouse petition (and again will be several more thousand) or declaring herself undocumented and being expelled from the US and banned for 10 years, and then petitioning for a green card again after (which gets thrown into the stack and could take decades)

Rules are rules, though many of these people who complain about undocumented people think even paying income tax is a rediculous sleight against them. I'm hard pressed to imagine how they'd feel about entering into this process. This is just my feelings, but I think it shows a lot more commitment to being an American than being popped out at an arbitrary location based on no merit or action of your own.

I've gotten a little off topic and I am definitely biased on this topic (as you can tell). Though going back to my original point, I dont believe people 1) know how the immigration system works 2) dont seem to mind adding additional hurdles regardless. Therefore I'm left to believe it's not exactly a rational subject of debate to decide what are pragmatic ways to lower illegal immigration, but more often vague generalities of why letting people in is bad.",1569797893,{},f1xg614,False,t3_dayp9t,False,False,t1_f1x7iu7,/r/news/comments/dayp9t/mississippi_police_officers_fatally_shot_a_man_in/f1xg614/,1569808263.0,5,True,[],False,news,t5_2qh3l,0.0,1569798448.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; There are two critical reasons the right is having this reaction, one more obvious than the other. The plainer reason is that as people who were personally touched by gun violence and as young people — old enough to be informed and articulate but still children — the students make extremely sympathetic advocates, garnering attention and a respectful hearing for their views. The less obvious reason is that because of that status, the students take away the most critical tool conservatives use to win political arguments: the personal vilification of those who disagree with them.

&gt; So right now, conservatives are engaged in a two-pronged attempt to take it back. On the more extreme side, you have the social media trolls, the conspiracy theorists, the more repugnant media figures, who are offering insane claims that the students are paid agents of dark forces, and can therefore be ignored. On the more allegedly mainstream side, you have radio and television hosts who are saying that the students are naive and foolish, and should not by virtue of their victimhood be granted any special status — and can therefore be ignored.

&gt; Once you rule out personal attacks, what’s left is arguing substance. No one is going to criticize Tucker Carlson or anyone else for disagreeing with the students, for saying “Here’s why the ban on AR-15s they’re proposing is a bad idea.” It’s only personal attacks on the students, which we so often accept as just how politics gets done, that come off sounding so despicable.

&gt; Which is exactly why the right wishes that the Parkland students would just go away.

Conservatives don't argue actual facts. They mainly rely on personally vilifying and slandering people they disagree with because they know they lose when they argue facts. Carlson knew damn well he could disagree with the Parkland students.

Qur'an Surah At-Tawba 9:73 and 9:123:

&gt;O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination

\--

&gt;O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness; and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).

These are explicit commands, regarding the caliphate, to fight the disbelievers closest to it, and then further away, and then the furthest away, in order to spread it. They're not referring to situations of war, or acts of self-defence, but active offense in order to spread the ummah. As narrated in the tafsir of Ibn Kathir:

&gt;The Order for Jihad against the Disbelievers and Hypocrites   
&gt;  
&gt;Allah commanded His Messenger to strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and to be harsh against them. Allah also commanded him to be merciful with the believers who followed him, informing him that the destination of the disbelievers and hypocrites is the Fire in the Hereafter. Ibn Mas\`ud commented on Allah's statement,  
&gt;  
&gt;(Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites) ""With the hand, or at least have a stern face with them.'' Ibn \`Abbas said, ""Allah commanded the Prophet to fight the disbelievers with the sword, to strive against the hypocrites with the tongue and annulled lenient treatment of them.'' Ad-Dahhak commented, ""Perform Jihad against the disbelievers with the sword and be harsh with the hypocrites with words, and this is the Jihad performed against them.'' Similar was said by  Muqatil and Ar-Rabi\`. Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, ""Striving against them includes establishing the (Islamic Penal) Law of equality against them.'' In combining these statements, we could say that Allah causes punishment of the disbelievers and hypocrites with all of these methods  in various conditions and situations, and Allah knows best.

and: 

&gt;The Order for Jihad against the Disbelievers, the Closest, then the Farthest Areas   
&gt;  
&gt;Allah commands the believers to fight the disbelievers, the closest in area to the Islamic state, then the  farthest. This is why the Messenger of Allah started fighting the idolators in the Arabian Peninsula. When he finished with them and Allah gave him control over Makkah, Al-Madinah, At-Ta'if, Yemen, Yamamah, Hajr, Khaybar, Hadramawt and other Arab provinces, and the various Arab tribes entered Islam in large crowds, he then started fighting the People of the Scriptures.

[],FenrisFrost,,,[],,,,text,t2_colv6,False,[],"Functional society has a need for balance. They feel the same when it counts. Some examples:

* My FIL is a Trump supporter and he is always complaining about handouts, but we live in a house hebgot in a housing lottery, with a special ultra low mortgage. He had no problem with handouts when they were for him. 

* He's also making great money at a union protected job working for the liberal government of the city, and seems to have no problem with that. But he gets mad when people say they should raise the minimum wage. 

* He's a high ranking officer in the city's EMS program, just recently he proudly showed me the meticulously planned response they gave to protect the straight pride parade. But this week he is being subjected to a training on school shootings, and feels as a gun lover that this is ""too political"" for his agency. 

* He is upset that he is a lieutenant whonha to sit in the office and deal with the masses of calls and complaints, citing to me yesterday how the field lieutenants all Doo much less work and just spend hours hanging out with each other. He did not have a problem with this when *he* was going to be one of them, of course. 

* My Italian relatives sit around the table and speak on Italian about how mad they are that the Brazilian people in the neighborhood speak Portuguese instead of English. They talk about how the Brazilians get everything whole they got nothing, while they sit in section 8 housing eating food bought with social security money.

* My wife's grandmother just said to me yesterday how we can't have universal health care because ""we can't afford it"" and she doesn't want her taxes to go to immigrants because ""we give them too much."" Yet just by being here and being old she expects social security to be there for her, as well as programs for seniors. I pointed out she is from another state and by her logic she should get nothing here as she should be her own state's problem. Her answer was ""but I work and pay taxes here!"" To which I replied ""So do a lot of immigrants.""

* A friend of my wife's is staunchly Republican against his own best interests. Ex military combat veteran who now manages a gas station 40 miles from where he lives, who is in his 40s but still needs to live with roommates, thinks the whole problem with the economy is too many handouts. His GI bill money isn't a handout though. 

* The same guy said ""I just don't want to pay for people on welfare"" to which I replied ""but you don't mind that I have to pay for your GI bill as a taxpayer? Or that I have to pay for all the military?"" He said of course that he ""earned"" the GI Bill money and that paying for this bloated military is ""necessary."" Now I agree he deserves the money but for the sake of argument I pointed out that it really isn't any different ultimately other than believing he somehow ""deserved"" it more. 

* My father spews on about Obamacare but it existing has literally saved his life after he suffered a stroke. I ahte Obamacare personally but in my father's case he was able to get treatment and not go completely bankrupt afterward. It makes no sense for him to hate it, he just does because reasons. 

* My mother in law is a nurse who recently lost her job and had to find a new one. She was a traveling nurse for a for profit business that basically all she did was spend a few hours a day going around to shovel pills down people's throats and make sure they consumed enough to require their refills in timely fashion. She pretty rarely had to work past noontime and made over 100,000k a year. Always complained about how understaffed they were and then alogn came a resolution to force businesses to limit how many patients per nurse. She believed this was a horribly bad thing even though the obvious net effect would have been the company hiring more nurses to keep the same amount of patients going, and voted against it. It failed and now her and my wife are more overworked then ever. 

* My MIL also lost that job because she routinely sis not so the paperwork for her visits until the last minute every week, remotely. She had a desk at the place she never sat at, and told us constantly how much they stressed using her tablet to do the paperwork right after the visit because it was how they got their money turned around quickest. When they finally shitcanned her it was after her boss went on a ride along with her, during which she didn't change a thing even though she knew she was taking huge advantage of the place. After basically doing a half a day in front of her boss she was promptly shitcanned. Her reasoning behind why was ""because all the lazy Nigerians are there now working the nursing jobs cheap.""

* She also walked off her next job after finding it was filled with terrible nurses who had little education. We live near about ten of the best hospitals in the world but she would never want to apply to them. Her logic was that those jobs were really stressful and difficult, and had a high barrier to entry because of advanced education requirements. But yet ""all the lazy Nigerians"" are taking them all. As if she was somehow annoyed that they were working less hard, when in reality they aren't. 

* My FIL was talking to me about his guns yesterday. We are always fencing about this, because I am pretty sure guys only act like they need guns, and in reality they just like pretending to be GI Joe. He was defending his AR, saying it was no more deadly than his handgun because the speed they fire at is determined by the firer's speed at shooting as they are both semiautomatic. So I asked him, if they are all equally lethal, why do you need the rifle? No answer. His usual response, ""When the EBT cards stop working I want to be ready,"" is sad on a lot of levels, so he's stopped using it as a comeback. 

* He once said to me in defense of owning guns, ""I'll do *anything* to protect my family."" I reminded him that I'd known them for years and he hadn't so much as locked the front door. 

* And we all know Schrodingers Immigrant guys, of course. You know the ones -- sometimes they say all the immigrants are stealing all the jobs, other times they say they are all too lazy to work and collecting benefits that they can't even get. They always ignore the facts -- that any immigrant working a real job is paying taxes and deserves the same shit other taxpayers get, and that if you remove racism from the immigration debate it turns into ""we have a ready workforce of people who want to integrate into our country and contribute to it's economy and tax revenue, and we say ""no"" because we, the wealthiest nation in human history with enough money that five guys have more than pretty much most of the Earth's population combined, ""can't afford it."" 

You get it yet? Society needs tolerance, it needs safety nets and social programs, it needs pathways to citizenship and human rights and *life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness*  to function. Without these things we descend into our grotesque dog-eat-dog nature.

Theae stories all have something in common. A person who has managed to prosper because of ""leftist"" policies and institutions, advocating entirely against them all the way when the shoe is on the other foot. Without these aspects in their lives, virtually all of these people would be helpless, homeless, dead. And yet in each of these stories the same people *want* that inflicted on others, purely because of some misplaced ideology that they *earned it*.  That they should get the help and ""the other"" should be left to rot.

[],xlea99,,,[],,,,text,t2_ljr11,False,,"Wow, lol I didn’t know I believed all those things, it seems you know me better than I know myself!

Truth is, I’m a relatively young adult, so I haven’t really formulated beliefs on most of those issues. Again, I just want to live past 40 tbh. 

To humor your comment I’ll state my current views on those issues so you can see just how much of a radical socialist I am.


Country founded on racism: I don’t think our country was ‘founded on racism’, but to ignore the racist things our country did like slavery, genocide of the Native Americans, etc etc is delusional. The US, like many countries, has a long history of good and bad. If you can’t accept the bad things we’ve done (including racism) I don’t know what to tell you.


“The Completely Debunked Gender Wage Gap”: I don’t want to get into a chain of hurling articles back and forth at each other, so I’ll just ask you this: do you believe women should be able to make the same amount of money and do the same types of work as men? Cause if not, you’re the problem.

Mandatory Buyback Program: While mandatory buyback programs have worked in the past and in other countries, I understand people’s concerns with the idea. All I care about is that kids stop dying in schools. Again I’ll pose the question: if the solution to school shootings is a mandatory (or voluntary) buyback program, would you be willing to part ways with your AR to save lives?


ICE: ICE is not a terrorist organization, Jesus Christ. Do I support the kids who are being put in cages and dying at the Mexico border? No. We obviously need border control, but how we’re doing it now is a human rights violation. If abolishing ICE is the only way to do that? We do it without question. Again, this issue I’m not very educated on, but anyone with a heart knows that what’s happening at the border is wrong.



Borders are Immoral: lol what? Do you mean like borders between countries? I mean, borders shouldn’t represent this animalistic, tribal division between people of the world, but obviously we need borders in our current society. 


Removal of Personal Choice: Under universal Healthcare, you can pick any doctor you want. You literally have more freedom than under our current system. I think that the idea of picking which doctor treats you instead of picking which corporation is gonna fuck you over is a better decision, but I guess I’m just a radical socialist.",1569358646,{},f1cj47v,False,t3_d8aqsx,False,True,t1_f1bav3f,/r/worldnews/comments/d8aqsx/trump_officials_struggle_to_justify_him_pressing/f1cj47v/,1569358653.0,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],Pantarus,,,[],,,,text,t2_9bm8v,False,,"We actually agree on a lot of individual points and there's some that absolutely won't see eye to eye on.

1) I 100% agree that immigration is being used as a scapegoat for changing times, changing industries, and automation. Coal mining started losing miners as technology changed allowing fewer men to operate far more powerful equipment. The nail in the coffin is cleaner, cheaper, and easier to obtain energy. But it's a lot easier to blame an immigrant than to accept that you need to change, are in a dying industry, and may need to accept a whole new way of life. But I also support diverting subsidies to help train, relocate, and assist people whose entire county will be devastated by the loss of an entire industry. They contributed for generations to this country and worked hard in difficult jobs that most of us wouldn't last a day in. We should over a boost to the next wrung of the ladder.

2) Although I'm a leftie I own several firearms. I'm pro-gun control in a sort of sweeping way. I believe that all firearm sales, private or through an FFL need to go through a background check, I believe a mental health records check for specific codes should be part of it. I also believe that (even if you don't have a felony) if you're convicted of several lesser crimes, that should add up to ""You're not a responsible citizen"" and shouldn't be allowed a firearm. I don't believe guns cause mass shootings, I believe they are a tool that's being misused. There is an endemic problem in the US, where there are sick people that desperately want to hurt others. Maybe it's a mental health issue...I don't have a solution. In the short term, I'm willing to peacefully hand over my AR if it becomes illegal. I'm not willing to completely disavow my 2A right altogether however.

3) This is where we separate first. I believe that until a certain point a fetus is just a non-living grouping of individual cells. I'm not religious so I don't believe in souls or that a life is instantly a life at conception, I don't believe there is anything sacred about it. I don't believe late term abortions should be legal unless it's an extenuating circumstance or the mother's life is in danger. That line in the sand should be up to OB/GYN's and experts to decide. I'm not experienced enough or know enough about the exact biology to give an opinion on where that line should be.

3) Pro-Birth Control 100% give that shit out like candy. Teach it in high school. Control teen pregnancies as much as possible. The problem I have with conservatives is that they want to teach abstinence (which statistically doesn't work) and still don't want abortions. I respect your opinion here, you can be pro-life...but then you shouldn't hamstring education on sex-ed.

4) I'm quasi-free trade. I do take issue with corporations taking advantage of lower quality of living standards of third world countries to effectively pay next to zero for labor. To me that's almost slavery, which does two things 1) Destroys the need for any US labor, increasing the scapegoating of immigrants 2) Because they pay so very little real wages to the third world country...it does very little to increase those people's standard of living at all.

5) Pro-Freedom Dividend: I agree with a universal basic income on a bunch of levels. First, we are a first world country and we need to set a minimum standard of living for our citizens. But that minimum, in my opinion, should be markedly below the living standard of someone working minimum wage. Which, minimum wage should be a living wage. Not 60 grand or anything, but you should be able to afford better than welfare standards if you are indeed working and trying to make it in this world. 

If you want to take that universal income and live on that, fine. But it won't be a high standard of living. I'd imagine anyone with any get-up-and-go won't be satisfied there and anyone without it, wouldn't have gotten past welfare life anyway. 

6) I'm for a wealth tax. Historically in the US, (lets call them the good ole days people keep trying to bring us back to) the wealthy were taxed much higher. You seem to have an Anne Rand view of billionaires, but even in her time there wasn't such a pooling of resources at the top. I don't think we should take everything everyone earns, but there comes a point where having that much money hoarded CAN affect innovation coming up from the bottom. The problem with capitalism is that it's basically a room full of spiders....at the end of the day...there's only going to be one left. 

Everyone should pay what they can pay. Ask not what your country can do for you type stuff. Once you reach a BILLION dollars...what are you spending that on? That isn't corporate wealth we are talking about, it's about individuals who have more money than some states. They'll still be filthy completely rich, to the point that their great-great-great-great grand-kids won't have to work or COULD even spend all that money while burning a 100,000.00 a day. That money could change the world.

7) Healthcare is interesting to me. For a selfish reason. I have kids. Eventually it has to happen. AS we progress as a society health care will become a human right. If I die tomorrow or my company decides to sell, or implode due to some CEO scandal, I shouldn't have to worry about my kids health. Nor should you. Nor should anyone. 

8) The student loan relief is one of those things that goes hand in hand with immigration. So in most developed countries, after passing a series of tests, their children get an education for free. Then they immigrate here and are now in competition for jobs with our students who are loaded down to the gills with debt. That's automatically putting our students at a massive disadvantage. Who knows what inventions are not being made or businesses not being started because someone said ""I can't afford this...why bother.""

I think if we free up education and make it a meritocracy we will be directly sponsoring our futures. BUT it has to be in areas that we need it. You want to go into fine arts? GREAT there are 20 spots open for the tops artists in the state. Go get em. After that, I believe you should be allowed to pay for it if you want it. Why should I stop you from learning what you wanna learn. But as a society we should be subsidizing engineers, scientists, etc.

I don't have all the answers by any means. Funny to see that there's tons of stuff we agree on, but it's these different nuances that separate us at the voting booth.

[],holydeltawings,,,[],,,,text,t2_am5i7,False,,"You speak of apple to orange. Then go and compare countries that are 100% different than the US. Odd isn't it.

But since you don't want to look into statistics within the US here you go.

There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.00925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:

• 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws

• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified

• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – gun violence

• 3% are accidental discharge deaths

So technically, ""gun violence"" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?

• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago

• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore

• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit

• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)

So basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.

This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.

Now, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.

Are 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That's why they are criminals.

On top of all of that, over 60% of firearm related homicides are by handguns. Less than 10% are rifles/shotguns. That includes your scary AR-15 rifles.

But what about other deaths each year?

• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!

• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths

• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide) 

Now it gets good: • 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If Obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!

Now I hate the confederate flag as much as the biggest bleeding heart liberal gun grabber. But this does not dictate whether or not he should or should not be able to own a firearm.

Deep down, you don't care if people kill each other though do you?

I don't know what you define as a ""prominent proposal to remove all guns,"" for several reasons, so I invite you to go there and find a proposal that fits the bill. Sorting by top all time might help.

And why is a subreddit that supports the second amendment an invalid source of links to news sources regarding proposals to ""remove all guns?"" That seems incredibly biased of you.

&gt;I'm asking you for any single mainstream call for the elimination of all firearms.

You can find that at /r/NOWTTYG. From their sidebar:

&gt;What we are looking for:

&gt;Specific legislative proposals (or laws) which involve seizure of existing firearms or outright bans of guns currently in circulation, or restrict/remove gun rights from people.

&gt;Editorials from reputable, substantive media outlets, or written by personalities which can or will affect the debate in months and years to come (i.e. not unknown bloggers or celebrities.) In order to accurately source quotes and make it hard to dismiss them as fabrications, links to original source content are preferred.

Sounds like they might have some good, nonpartisan sources detailing mainstream calls to eliminate all firearms.

&gt;Jesus. No one wants to eliminate every single gun.

&gt;I repeat: No one's arguing to eliminate every single gun.

The evidence, should you choose to grace it with your momentary attention, would show you otherwise.

&gt;Great. Have increasing fines and then increasing jailtime with some amnesty days peppered in. The morons can go to jail for their love of their AR and handguns.

So, do the same thing that isn't really working in AUS and NZ? Cool. As I said before, if this cause is seriously pursued, it will be far worse than the war on drugs. As of 2018, about 17% of the US used illegal drugs, including cannabis (federally illegal, thus illegal), and 43% of households had a gun. If a generous 3% of those households complied, that still leaves about 41, 42% of households in possession of an illegal weapon.

The US already has the highest prisoner population per capita in the world by a wide margin, and you want to make that worse. From the [Prison Policy Initiative:](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/global/2018.html)

&gt;In fact, many of the countries that rank alongside the least punitive U.S. states, such as Turkmenistan, Thailand, Rwanda, and Russia, have authoritarian governments or have recently experienced large-scale internal armed conflicts. Others struggle with violent crime on a scale far beyond that in the U.S.: El Salvador, Russia, Panama, Costa Rica, and Brazil all have murder rates more than double that of the U.S. Yet the U.S., “land of the free,” tops them all.

One of the problems with a high prisoner population is that prison becomes a place to make connections with networks of criminals, so that when prisoners get out an inevitably have a hard time finding legitimate work, they get recruited by other ex-cons to do illegal things for profit. And this is where the 400 million guns in the US comes in--if they're already breaking laws, it's often not much added risk to break the law and possess a weapon. So what you end up with is a very high population of prisoners, increased criminal activity, and lots of guns in criminal hands, all of which is worse than what you started with. That doesn't seem like a workable solution, nor is it empathetic or effective.

&gt; No, I've just looked at which guns are used in murders.

&gt;Have you?

Yes, it would be irresponsible of me *not* to. I hope it's becoming clear to you now that I actually do a fair bit of research into this topic, and I don't shy away from things I find uncomfortable. 

Now, looking at what guns are used in murders, the vast majority of murders are by handgun. So why do you want to ban all semi-autos? Because some of them are used in mass shootings? But mass shootings are statistically insignificant to the overall number of murders. They do get a lot of coverage, and they are catastrophic to local communities, so I can see why you might want to remove the weapons used. But bolt-action rifles are actually quite competitive for mass killing, and their high ballistic energy actually makes them more suited to sniper-style shootings like the Texas Clocktower shooting. For closer range shootings like inside a school, shotguns are absolutely devastating, with more ballistic energy than even high-powered bolt action rifles, and they often carry more rounds and can be reloaded on the fly. See, this is why there are people calling for the removal of all guns, because guns are deadly weapons, and are designed as such.

&gt;Hahaha, yeah. You're politically active in arguing against restrictions.

Some restrictions, yeah, but that's a non-sequitur. Clearly you forgot that we were talking about *reform?*

&gt;You're clearly not fighting gun reform tooth and nail.

Yeah, that. Reform. Not restrictions. Now, I see why you might think those two words are synonyms, because how you use ""reform"" would make it synonymous with ""restriction,"" but I'd invite you to take a look at those two words in any dictionary of your choosing. You'll find that they are, in fact, rather different.

&gt;Guess which party is blocking that as well

Not the party I voted for, why are you looking at me? Oh, do you think that because I'm pro gun I must vote Republican? Here's some more 2A subreddits you can ignore: /r/liberalgunowners, /r/2ALiberals, /r/SocialistRA

&gt;I presented an idea. You're questioning it. I'm responding.

&gt;Sorry I didn't ask how your day went?

You're responding to assumptions you've made about me. Be sorry you didn't try to figure out what I think before assuming you already knew.

&gt;I'm always a little surprised by this argument.

&gt;""Hm, these people want me to turn in my weapons. I'll convince them that they shouldn't try by suggesting that people will use those weapons if they try to get us to do so. That will definitely make them think that they're no problem whatsoever!""

Those weapons aren't a problem until someone tries to take them away. Gun owners commit fewer crimes than the general population, and CC gun owners are convicted of fewer crimes than the police. But when the government tries to take civilian guns, those guns will be used. You do know about Lexington and Concord, right? Those skirmishes were fought over powder stores. American citizens think they have a right to bear arms for some reason, and view any attempt to infringe that right as tyranny. American citizens have a strong track record of fighting tyrants with guns. If you're not a tyrant there's nothing to worry about.

&gt;Would you?

Yes.

&gt;Because here you are arguing against removing the most lethal weapons from the shelves and therefore streets.

Yes. Because honestly, if I could get rid of every gun in the world and make it so that they weren't needed **because no one wanted to kill another and we all still had our free will and freedom of choice and thought, I'd do it. But I can't.**

&gt;There's also your 130/250 lb argument at the end that seems to indicate otherwise...

Indicate otherwise to what? If no one *ever* wanted to kill me, that argument wouldn't be necessary, as I said before; if I could get rid of every gun in the world **and make it so that they weren't needed *because no one wanted to kill another* and we all still had our free will and freedom of choice and thought, I'd do it.

But people do want to kill me. They've tried. I see no way of guaranteeing someone will never want to kill me. That's an unrealistic, idealistic, utopian, fantasy.

&gt;One where you cling to the thing you claim to recognize as a problem on the argument that it could never change.

Getting rid of all guns doesn't get rid of murder, murderous impulse, crime, or much of anything except the guns themselves. Humans will still be human deep down; part good, part bad, capable of great things, capable of terrible things. That's the reality I recognize. Is yours different?

Ultimately, I see the solution as one that addresses that fundamental problem; humans sometimes have a desire to kill, so how can we make sure they don't have that desire, or at the very least, channel it into something disciplined and useful to society like the military. Getting rid of guns, even if it could actually happen, doesn't solve the root of the problem, though it might reduce the scale of the problem somewhat. Might, because before guns were made, violence was an even bigger problem than it is now. I want civilians to be armed because it's a safeguard on some kinds of government overreach. The 20th century showed us exactly how dangerous those kinds of government overreach can be, and it's far worse than the gun violence problem we have now. So, I'd like to pursue a different solution than simple bans and confiscations of civilian firearms.

I've heard it said that inside every problem is a bigger problem waiting to get out. Doing nothing will let the big problem out, but so will doing something wrong.

Printing accessories and parts to a gun is diffrent from printing a whole gun. I ain't arguing about printing parts to a gun, I'm only focusing on fully printed firearms.

The risk people fearmonger about it is really over hyped, printed weapons are not traditionally reliable enough with the materials to be a higher risk than already existing methods of homemade weapons. You can make a more consistant and reliable firearm from pipes and scrap metal available at any hardware store. Look at some prison made weapons out there that have been found and discovered.. People can make a weapon out of anything. All I'm saying is a home printer won't be able to make a really good weapon, and the risks are high that it won't end well for the user.

Sometimes, just because you CAN doesn't mean you should.


On a side note, based on how you are discussing this.. I do think most gun control laws are bullshit. Does there need to be some better regulation on firearms? Yes but, Are the laws that ACTUALLY get passed doing anything to curb the problem? No.. They only hurt legal gun owners and make dumb regulation restrictions.

Fully 3d printed guns are not a huge public risk like media seems to like making them seem. If your going through the trouble of 3d printing a gun to kill someone, there's a few hundred faster and more efficient ways to go about it.

I asked on the Canadian gun subreddit, and the general consensus is this is the only murder by an ar15 in Canada 


&gt;Kevin Leclair was killed in a gang hit by an AR-15 and a 9mm pistol

(from a reddit user) 

&gt;[565] 22 expended rifle casings and one live rifle casing was found at the scene close to each other and near to a black Honda CRV that was parked at an angle partly in and partly out of a parking stall immediately to the south of the central walkway and west of the IGA. Two expended 9 millimeter cartridges were found, one located in the centre of the central walkway east of the red Chevy pick-up and another near the end of the central walkway at the roadway. Two live 9 millimeter rounds were also found near the one spent round found at the end of the central walkway.

&gt;[566] An AR-15 automatic rifle with the magazine in the weapon was found on the ground between a red Chevy pick-up and a grey Saturn parked on the north side of the central walkway in the mall parking lot. Two live rounds remained in the magazine. The weapon was not fitted with and did not have Picatinny mounting rails, although it was not impossible to fit the gun with this accessory.

&gt;EDIT: The UN Gang most likely smuggled the weapon into Canada as a part of their criminal business smuggling drugs and such.

&gt;[39] There was also business in firearms. Witness D sold semi-automatic pistols, sub-machine guns, and assault rifles, including the AR-15, within the gang. Witness A and Roueche imported firearms from the United States via helicopter on at least one occasion. Most gang members had firearms.

&gt;Also found this case [R. v. Abbasi](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2014/2014oncj686/2014oncj686.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAScmVzdHJpY3RlZCBub3JpbmNvAAAAAAE&amp;resultIndex=1) A legally owned restricted Norinco rifle was used to shoot up a house with no injuries/deaths. I'm assuming it's an AR by the fact its a restricted norinco .22 calibre firearm most likely the Norinco CQA. 

(if you're interested and have the time, the court case is a fascinating read) 

There was also a failed mob hit that injured a [bystander](

But that seems to be it, even digging into our court reporting has nearly 0 mention of Ar-15s.

[],Zixinus,,,[],,,,text,t2_v8pbc,False,,"&gt;The issue is how effective a gun is for killing lots of people in a relatively short period of time, i.e., committing mass shootings/terror attacks. 

TL,DR version: this is misleading and creates arbitrary categories (good gun and bad gun) where there are none. All guns are effective at killing many people in short amount of time (unless you are going to say something ridiculous and obsolete like a musket). There are no guns that are meant to kill few people in a short time or guns meant to only slightly kill people. 

But let's take your definition seriously for a moment. Guns designed to kill as much people as possible in the shortest time possible are weapons like grenade launcher or mortals or other explosives. With some argument, so are machine guns (and for clarity, I am talking about dedicated fully-automatic-only weapons that are usually belt-fed or use large-capacity box magazines). All of these weapons are unavailable to civilian populations in pretty much every country in the world. 
Explosives are unavailable everywhere in the world and the weapons themselves are almost the same (where special licenses like being a museum may allow you to get such weapons but usually only after they are disabled and almost always through very strict regulations). 

Rifles (battle or assault or even sniper) are designed to be basic weapons that have multiple roles. They can kill many people if the people bunch together, but that doesn't really happen in terms of modern warfare. Handguns in particular are designed defensively, as a deterrent and self-defense rather than creating a large body-count. 

I'm not saying this as a red herring, but to point out that the whole ""weapon to kill as many people as possible"" is scare-tactic rhetoric, not one grounded in any useful technical or military definition. There are no civilian weapons that are somehow designed to be perfect for mass-shooters. Civilian weapons are downgraded versions of military weapons and most civilian weapons are derivatives or variations of military ones or take features from military ones. There no evil or good guns, there are just guns. 

What is a bad weapon for anything but self-defense in military context is still more than adequate for a mass shooter. The point example of this is handguns. For a soldier under most circumstances, a handgun is the last choice of firearm (with only bayonets and other melee weapons worse and those are usually the worst examples). But for a mass-shooter, a pistol is perfectly adequate to fire into crowds. Especially when more than one pistol is carried, as done by some mass shooters. 

Banning semi-automatics is a viable strategy that some useful impact as this reduces the rate of fire of the then available weapons. 

However, it must be considered this is already a compromise and will only mitigate the damage that mass-shooters will do, not prevent them or truly neuter them. As it happened in the infamous Texas Clock Tower shooting, a mass shooter (who used bolt-action rifles and sawed-off shotguns) can simply bring more weapons to compensate for the limited firing rate. 

&gt;Why are the color, furniture, and accessorizability of guns popularly and sensibly referred to as assault rifles so similar to military guns designed for killing lots of people?

TL, DR: This question makes no sense unless you are deliberately muddling the definition of ""assault rifle"". Only the military (and select law enforcement) has assault rifles. Civilians cannot buy assault rifles. At best, civilians can buy semi-automatic rifles that have some features of military assault rifles but that doesn't and cannot make them actual assault rifles. 

The long version is going to delve into the actual meaning of assault rifle, so I hope you are willing to read because this took some time to type.

Color, furniture and accessories do not and cannot make a gun an assault rife (per the proper term). You can take an old-timey, bolt-action WW2-era rifle (that any military mostly consider obsolete) and give it a camo paint-job, a modern frame and stock (furniture) and accessory rails and you'll still have the same lethal power as it had before. It will fire the same bullets at the same rate (in the case of a bolt-action, limited by the user's skill), with the same ammunition limitations. At best, you can give it a bigger magazine, better scope(s) and better ergonomics than the original but those are relatively minor improvements. 

Focusing on color, furniture and accessories is like trying to regulate illegal street racing by banning red paint and racing stripes on cars. It is a distraction on the cosmetic rather than the substantial. 

Caveat: there are exceptions like the bumper-stock that slipped through the federal regulatory authorities. But that has been rectified and such modifications that have such an impact are extremely rare and type-specific. Usually, to alter the core mechanisms of a gun requires professional armorers and millers who actually have the ability to produce firearms.

Before I continue, let's resolve any ambiguity around the term ""assault rifle"". Assault rifles in the military context (and the only proper definition) are defined by three basic features:
- Intermediate cartridge. Roughly, these are rifle cartridges designed to be easier to fire full-auto than ""full"" rifle cartridges but still have good accuracy and able to penetrate most body armor. As the hunting of medium game (deer, boar and similar sized animals or bigger) is preferred with ""full"" rifle cartridges (which so-called battle-rifles have) if not more powerful, these are not important for the discussion of gun control. 
- Detachable magazines that can be ejected and swapped rapidly. This is a standard feature to most rifles since WW2 onward. From a gun control standpoint, limiting commercial magazine capacity has some use but only so much. Modifying magazines is relatively easy and it is even possible to make them, as they are essentially boxes with a spring inside them. 
- The heart of the issue: select-fire between fully-automatic (continuously firing until trigger is held) and semi-automatic (firing only once per trigger pull) and/or burst-fire (fixed-amount of bullets per trigger pull) mode. This is a key feature and one that confuses gun-control advocates most. A rifle that has neither full-auto or burst-fire is not an assault rifle and just a rifle.

The simple fact of the matter that civilian rifles have the first two features but not the third. In Canada and the US, civilian weapons are strictly semi-automatic (if not things like bolt-action or lever-action). Without either burst-fire or fully-automatic firing modes, no rifle is an assault rifle (except perhaps in academical historic context). The commercial AR-15 as sold in the US is not an assault rifle and no amount of changes in furniture, color and accessories will change that. As long as it is semi-automatic, it is simply a rifle and not that different from any other semi-automatic rifle designed before it and after it.

Then there is the term ""assault-style"". This is a vague and ultimately meaningless definition. What is good for an assault is utterly subjective and comparative. What was considered good for assaults in WW2 is now considered obsolete. Yet this is the most often used term gun-control advocates and what frustrates gun advocates. Because it is vague and allows the politician to scare those unfamiliar with the terms and imply that there fully-automatic weapons out there when there aren't. It is also dishonest of the politician because then rather than any impactful actions that have any effect on mass-shootings, they can instead implement things like the useless ""assault weapons ban"" that do nothing to deter or hinder mass-shooters and destroy any goodwill of gun owners (as it has happened in the US).

To answer your question, in the firearms world the military are the trend-setters. This is simply due to the fact that military weapons are produced in the largest numbers and it is the military that demands development in firearms. Thus new features and innovations are almost always military innovations even if they are as minor as replacing wood with plastic. Firearm developments, no matter how minor, are then carried over from military to civilian weapons. Most civilian weapons are modified versions of military models (due to mass manufacturing) if not the same (as it is especially in the case of pistols). Accessory rails are as useful to legitimate civilian gun owners as they are to the military, even though they do not make the gun actually any more powerful than it already is. Putting a laser pointer on a pistol does not make it ""commando stlye"" or the user as skilled as actual-commandos. Just like features such as a four-wheel drive, almost none of these features are relevant or useful to the topic of gun control. 

I'd like to make an example here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20170627164537/https://www.blog.riflegear.com/2007/12/26/hello-kitty-ar-15-evil-black-rifle-meets-cute-and-cuddly/
(I'm using waybackmachine becasue a direct link gives a blank page)
This is an AR-15 that complies with the AWP weapon ban, which focused on ""assault features"". Aside the 10-round, fixed magazine it will kill someone just as well as a military M16 as it fires the same cartridge. It has become not at all less deadly. It is not black, it has old furnishings and has no accessory rail or even a bayonet lug. Yet it has become not any more deadly than before.

This entire problem is a result of us making the internet more and more accessible to people who truly do not understand what it is they are using.

The result is what I tend to end up calling 'siloing.'

The internet is great at helping you find what you want, [but it puts you there and then essentially keeps you there](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) - we are currently in a situation where that has gotten further along.

Every single person they have disagreed with along the way they have kicked out to the point that it is just an echo chamber of opinions, which has resulted in escalations of their feelings and beliefs as there is no one to tell them otherwise - those people were kicked out long ago.

It is pretty dangerous, the fact that these people are just sitting out there in these groups together with no input from the outside world. Then people like [Steve Bannon comes through and starts targeting them for voting blocks.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/18/steve-bannon-learned-harness-troll-army-world-warcraft/489713001/)

[Filter bubbles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) is part of what I am talking about. But this is beyond that, this is social networks and groups inside of them isolating them further beyond just what your search filters show you. This is removing anything from their world that disagrees with their current reality that they have built and ignoring things in front of their faces to do so.

This is effectively a feedback loop of the worst kind - hate, anger, and fear are what motivates them and they all pat each other on the back when these things are discussed. They are normalizing those patterns of behavior as their norm.

The fact that they started to get there through filter bubbles makes sense, but they congregated into places and formed groups and kicked out anyone who didn't fit their reality and then kept moving forward for years. This is beyond search filters at this point and into the realm of social blocks that he is targeting by going into those areas and influencing them through more fear and more hate and more anger for his agenda.

Filter bubbles can put you into a search engine loop, actively ignoring and dismissing reality to justify your search engine loop is a behavioral problem, an education problem, and a problem with being able to sanity check information online - not just a search engine problem (At least IMO)

Kelley was then confronted by and traded fire with Stephen Willeford, a local resident and former NRA firearms instructor[13] who was armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Willeford had taken cover behind a truck across the street from the church and shot Kelley twice, once in the leg and in the upper left torso under his tactical gear.[14][15][16] Kelley, who had dropped his rifle upon the initial fire with Willeford, fired back with a handgun before fleeing in his Ford Explorer. Willeford fired one more round as Kelley sped north on FM 539.[17][18] Willeford then noticed a pickup truck parked at the intersection of 4th St. and FM 539, driven by Johnnie Langendorff.

Willeford approached and entered Langendorff's truck on the passenger side. They then pursued Kelley at high speed for about five to seven minutes. According to Langendorff, they drove at speeds up to 95 miles per hour (155 km/h).[19] While chasing Kelley, Langendorff called 9-1-1 and reported their location to the operator as they assumed that the police were on their way to the church.

During the chase, Kelley called his wife and spoke to her and his parents, informing them ""I just shot up the Sutherland Springs church,""[20] and telling his father that he was injured and thought that he would not survive.[16] Kelley repeatedly emphasized how sorry he was.[20] Bleeding from his injuries, Kelley soon lost control of his vehicle, hitting a road sign before crossing a bar ditch at the Hartfield/Sandy Elm Road intersection and finally stopping about 30 feet into the field on the opposite side.

Willeford and Langendorff observed that he was motionless, and police took over the scene when they arrived.[21] Police found Kelley dead in his car[22] with three gunshot wounds, including a self-inflicted head wound.[23] Two handguns were found in the vehicle: a Glock 19 9mm and a Ruger SR22 .22-caliber, both of which Kelley had purchased.[24]

It's all about the superficial features.

If you were to describe an assault weapon, you would probably describe the features that are common across the AR-15 and AK-47:

1. Semi-automatic.
2. Folding or telescoping stock.
3. Pistol grip.
4. Rails for mounting lights, optics, or accessories.
5. Attachment point for sling
6. Barrel shroud to protect against heat radiation from barrel.

Now, to try and ban these guns, and any gun that might mimic them, we try and ban the features.

1. **Semi-Automatic** \- can't ban this, as this would ban 90-95% of all firearms in possession, including most handguns and many hunting arms. Clearly would be unconstitutional in light of D.C. v. Heller and the second amendment.
2. **Folding or telescoping stock** \- banned this in 1994. Pretty easy to make the same AR-15 with a static stock, as this is how the government issues the select-fire fully-automatic M-16 variant to the military to this day.
3. **Pistol Grip** \- CA has banned them, and there are CA-compliant AR-15s out there right now. Also, does not affect ballistics/deadliness at all.
4. **Rails** \- Can't really ban this feature, as almost all hunting arms use them, as do olympic shooters. Also, does not affect ballistics/deadliness at all.
5. **Attachment point for sling** \- again, almost all rifles have this, including hunting rifles. Also, does not affect ballistics/deadliness at all.
6. **Barrel shroud** \- Most hunting rifles either use wood on half of the barrel, or a barrel shroud around the entire barrel to protect the user from heat. Also, does not affect ballistics/deadliness at all.

I don't know what you consider small caliber, and recoil is so subjective to the operator as to be useless as a measurement. Here's my best attempt, a few reasons why someone might prefer a rifle with those characteristics:

* competitive action shooting
* varminting/pest control
* collectible/historical value (such as service rifles that can be traced to famous battles or users)
* flexibility (ex. being able to fire either .223 or .300 BLK with only a barrel swap)
* customization (certain platforms, like the AR family, have a vast array of aftermarket mods and accessories)
* physical disability (shooter lacks strength or manual dexterity to operate a lever or bolt action)

Lastly, don't overlook the fact that something doesn't need to be *the best* at anything to have a legitimate purpose. If my budget is limited, I would choose one rifle that can fill multiple roles *acceptably well* over several that excel at one thing.

Emphasis on the most interesting to me part. Shootings were rare during the ban, true, but they were also rare *before* the ban. Why? School shootings have only been a thing about 20 years, and only been *really* prevalent the last 10 or so. Yet many of the guns targeted by proposed bans and buybacks have been around 50 years or longer. They may have become more common, but they haven't gotten any more lethal. So what is the connection?

The real fact is that these laws were created centuries ago and we cannot assume that they knew we would have death rockets that can split an atom and leave an area barren in a... REALLY fucking small amount of time in the grand scheme. Just look at the jump in tech over 20 years. It's incredulous.

The fact that you drew any line defeats your argument and only brings me back to mine. A line MUST be drawn and we must decide, collectively, where it is drawn. Okay, so for you that line is a nuke. Maybe a tank? Should the average home have an RPG launcher above the mantle? A Vulcan on the roof?

I argue that something as small as an AR-15 is an indescriminate weapon of destruction, if not as massive. Point and hold a trigger and people just start dying as you hose bullets down range.

One can also dream as much as they wish. I could try figuring out how to form a black hole and somehow propel it into something to destroy it. I can do the theoretical math, have all my variables solved for and unless I succeed, I have not caused advancement but rather I have simply started the process. It is 2019 and we still don't have any death rays... publically... but we sure as hell figured out how to efficiently stack bullets behind each other fast enough to make it a minimal difference.

As for limiting escalation, I mean limiting the idea of ""if people have pistols, criminals will have rifles so people will get rifles then criminals will get rocket launchers"" and so on.

As for being the ""most law abiding"" I will take that with a grain of salt. You point to old history when the US was far more timultuous. Recent history shows that every major mass shooting in recent US history has been performed by a single gun owner.

The shooting in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 alone had 58 dead, over 500 wounded. Likely many survived only thanks to modern medicine and injuries unrelated to the direct gunfire such as the trampling panic caused by a crowd trying to run from an active shooter.

November 5, 2017. Sutherland springs, Texas. 27 dead, perp killed himself with a gun before capture.

February 14, 2018. Parkland, Florida. 17 dead and over a dozen injured.

May 18, 2018. Santa Fe, Texas, 10 dead, 13 injured with a shotty and a .38 revolver.

That's 112 by my count and that's a small fragment of what's posted here:

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-08-03/united-states-mass-shootings

I would hardly call gun owners the most law abiding citizens given that these are among owners of guns. That said, there are good and bad people everywhere and that is my point.

Guns themselves do not kill, this is true. However, they are tools and like many tools in life certain tools need proper training and regulation and some level of hoop to jump through to get to that point.

As for why they should? Because if a person is legally being stopped for something they illegally did, then the officer should be able to have an upper hand as should a military individual have an upper hand over a police officer. The strength of the people comes from their numbers. You don't need an AR-15 bleeding bullets if you have 30 people raising their pistols against it. Of course, individual issues occur and I'm not saying they don't, but the kind of defense you are talking about is simply not meant to be on an individual scale in my opinion. And there's the key. Opinion.

I stated from the start that my view was an opinion. I also stated that I love a good time at the range and I'm happy for people to have weapons to defend themselves against whatever it is they may need to defend themselves against... but I'm sorry, you cannot compare a massacre of a people that the US was CONQUORING at the time - and no I do not mean to say that is fine and good, but I do mean it to say that context is everything. A brief look also shows that it was sparked by a very unfortunate misunderstanding between two primitive, warring cultures. ONE person who happened to be deaf refused to disarm, a discharge went off shot heard round the world style, and guns were a blazing.

It was not a hostile takeover at first, but ended up that way because a gun went off and people just started shooting and fighting. One could argue if that rifle were never involved... if the crack of gunfire never spooked the soldiers... then the massacre may never have happened to begin with. It was bloody, it was dark, and it was all caused by a single gunshot. 


Thomas Tibbles (1840–1928), journalist:

""Suddenly, I heard a single shot from the direction of the troops. Then three or four. A few more. And immediately, a volley. At once came a general rattle of rifle firing then the Hotchkiss guns.""

Waco was a legal raid with warrents and all. It was joint between local and federal forces as well as the military. They were hunting a pedophile who had stockpiled illegal ammunition after responding to multiple citizen-filed complaints.

Again, cases cannot pinpoint a source but again, a potential ""accidental discharge"" lead to a more active approach and a massive shootout and even massive, days-long SIEGE where the final death toll was 76. This is not from a mass shooting, this is from a criminal organization holing up in a compound and forcing an assault... Then either burning the building down around themselves or having the assault itself leave it burning while some were trapped inside. That 76 also includes the people that put their life on the line in that assault. Calling it a mass shooting in the same vein as some person who can't take no for an answer getting a hair up their ass and a gun in their hand is an insult.

&gt;As I opened the CT scan last week to read the next case, I was baffled. The history simply read “gunshot wound.” I have been a radiologist in one of the busiest trauma centers in the United States for 13 years, and have diagnosed thousands of handgun injuries to the brain, lung, liver, spleen, bowel, and other vital organs. I thought that I knew all that I needed to know about gunshot wounds, but the specific pattern of injury on my computer screen was one that I had seen only once before.
&gt;
&gt;In a typical handgun injury, which I diagnose almost daily, a bullet leaves a laceration through an organ such as the liver. To a radiologist, it appears as a linear, thin, gray bullet track through the organ. There may be bleeding and some bullet fragments.
&gt;
&gt;I was looking at a CT scan of one of the mass-shooting victims from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who had been brought to the trauma center during my call shift. The organ looked like an overripe melon smashed by a sledgehammer, and was bleeding extensively. How could a gunshot wound have caused this much damage?
&gt;
&gt;The reaction in the emergency room was the same. One of the trauma surgeons opened a young victim in the operating room, and found only shreds of the organ that had been hit by a bullet from an AR-15, a semiautomatic rifle that delivers a devastatingly lethal, high-velocity bullet to the victim. Nothing was left to repair—and utterly, devastatingly, nothing could be done to fix the problem. The injury was fatal.
&gt;
&gt;A year ago, when a gunman opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale airport with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, hitting 11 people in 90 seconds, I was also on call. It was not until I had diagnosed the third of the six victims who were transported to the trauma center that I realized something out of the ordinary must have happened. The gunshot wounds were the same low-velocity handgun injuries that I diagnose every day; only their rapid succession set them apart. And all six of the victims who arrived at the hospital that day survived.",1569721004,{},f1rw9tr,False,t3_daob63,False,True,t1_f1rtk5n,/r/politics/comments/daob63/clintonera_assault_weapons_ban_did_work_according/f1rw9tr/,1569722682.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],bobndougmckenzie,,,[],,,,text,t2_4jggbem0,False,[],"Look, I'm Canadian, not American, so I don't have a dog in this fight. We have excellent firearms laws here requiring licensing beforehand and a background check is run every single day on all firearms owners in the country so that police can confiscate firearms immediately after someone breaks the law. As a result firearms owners in Canada are 3x LESS likely to commit a crime compared to the average citizen.

But this ""assault weapons"" stuff is bullshit. A semi-automatic in a particular caliber is no more dangerous than any other semiautomatic in that caliber. The fact that it's black or is an ar15 makes absolutely zero difference because they all fire one bullet with one trigger pull. 

An ""assault weapon"" is a gun with select fire, meaning that it can be semiautomatic with one shot fired pre trigger pull, burst automatic with 3-5 shots fired per pull of the trigger, or fully automatic with magazine limited number of shots fired per pull of the trigger.
These are prohibited in both Canada and the U.S.

Saying that publicly available semi-automatic rifles are ""assault rifles"" simply because they look the same as select fire rifles used by the military is stupid. It undermines your argument for gun control by demonstrating that you have absolutely zero understanding of the topic. It's like claiming that because exotic sports cars are usually convertibles that can drive over 200mph and should be illegal because no one needs to drive that fast, Miatas should now be illegal because they are convertible sports cars too. If you aren't a car person that may not be entirely clear but I think you get the picture.

So you create laws to outlaw miatas just like you're outlawing AR-15s. And you claim that they're everywhere and must be made illegal!

Except because the initial reasoning is faulty all of the solutions are faulty as well. The reason that miatas and ar15s are popular isn't because they're automatic rifles for the armed forces or exotic sports cars that can hit 200mph. The reason is because they're cheap as shit compared to the real deal, while still being highly reliable and not prone to breaking down every 50 feet like an exotic sports car. And just like a Miata has a tiny 180hp engine compared to an exotic with 1500hp, an ar15 has a single bullet shot per trigger pull compared to an assault rifle which fires bursts or unlimited amounts of bullets per trigger pull. 

If I own a Miata it doesn't mean that I'm going to be able to drive 200mph, and just because I own an ar15 doesn't mean that I can shoot more than one bullet at a time- exactly like every other semiautomatic rifle that doesn't look black and ""scary"".

TL;DR stop arguing about looks of firearms because it makes you look ignorant and stupid and ensures that anyone who understands the topic immediately dismisses your baseless concerns. Just make training, licensing, and background checks mandatory and your mass shooting problem will evaporate in a puff of smoke.

Also, as a Canadian could you please fuck off with the ""assault rifles"" bullshit, because even though we don't have a mad shooter problem, or any problem with firearms owners at all, we still have to deal with our equally ignorant politicians who parrot everything you say and want to limit or access because you all can't be responsible with yours.",1569719723,{},f1rst63,False,t3_daob63,False,False,t3_daob63,/r/politics/comments/daob63/clintonera_assault_weapons_ban_did_work_according/f1rst63/,1569721339.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,1569720417.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No more gun control is coming from a place of fear and ignorance, and gun rights from facts. 

The reason AR-15s are “in the sights” of reasonable gun-control reformers is because not only are they powerful weapons capable of a high rate of fire,

Actually as far as rifles go, AR-15s are pretty underpowered. The standard AR shoots caliber .223 which is just a more powerful .22, and the least powerful standard rifle round after the .22. They also are no faster shooting than any other rifle. 

 they’re menacing weapons, and the last thing gun fans want to admit is that guns are frightening and high-profile shootings involving ARs are terrorist acts. 

They are scary looking, that's why people want to ban them. Also not all mass shootings are terrorist attacks, as terrorism requires a political goal. Terrorism or not, it doesn't change the severity of the attack. 

The weapons themselves symbolize the fear the assailants seek to inspire. Whether some other gun can match the lethality doesn’t matter when the public is rightly terrified by one type of gun in particular. We’re trying to reduce the level of fear as well as reduce casualties. Anyone minimizing the deaths associated with such weapons is missing the forest for the trees.

Cosmetic in the sense, that there are firearms that are functionally identical to the AR-15, that are exempt from an AWB, such as the Rugar Mini 14. The assault weapons ban, is like trying to ban red cars with spoilers to reduce car crashes. 

&gt;Also your percentages are red herrings.  What's the percentage for assault rifle usage in mass shooting homicides?
&gt;

How are they ""red herrings""? Pistols by far outnumber rifles in homicides. Even among mass shootings, [pistols outnumber rifles 3 to 1.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/) Although to be fair they don't give the criteria of what constitutes a ""mass shooting"". 

&gt;And pistols are more widespread but nobody is credibly suggesting banning them (despite the whiny histrionics of gun extremists) because most reasonable people from all over the political spectrum with half a brain can understand the difference between war weapons and those which can be responsibly be used by people for self protection/sport and which should be allowed by the 2nd amendment.

That's the problem, if gun control advocates really did care about preventing gun deaths, they would target pistols.

As for the biology behind transsexual and homosexuality, Scientists haven't figured it out, my guess is because there's no good animal model, the the genetic risks are multifactorial (i.e. variation of many genes) and it's hard to get any funding due to the sensitivity of the subject.

[],Sacred_Silly_Sack,,,[],,,,text,t2_12b0a0,False,,"In general I think you're getting caught up in the term ""meritocracy"" when the topic at hand is racism.  I don't think trying to identify or quantify to what extent we are a meritocracy is important compared to identifying, quantifying, and dismantling racist systems. 

&amp;#x200B;

1). What we see in relationship to income is a \*bias\* among races in the US. ie white guys make the most, by far. This is explainable by years of white supremacist policy. Wealth should, ideally, be normally distributed across races - that's a sign of an economy operating outside of racist policy.

Within racial groups we will find the distribution to be approaching normal, with biases towards other difficult problems like sexism.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Im going to skip around here\*

&amp;#x200B;

3). This is literally my point, and I'm not sure what we're arguing about anymore... This is the perfect example - all things being equal, whatever it is that makes some people more or less driven to make money is distributed normally across all racial groups. When we see a bias in the distribution of wealth between racial groups we \*know\* that there must a selective pressure, and you nailed it on the head here - large populations of Black Americans have been denied access constitutionally guaranteed quality eduction. These selective pressures that work against and for racial groups need to be dismantled.  We'll know when we've successfully dismantled them when we no longer measure biases among traits that should be normally distributed. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) I personally believe that there is incredibly little variation in biologically derived intelligence and most differences we see are a consequence of environment during developmental years. But that's a little irrelevant here. I think the only thing to say at this point is that my concept of meritocracy is a filter that correctly selects for those at the extremes of the normally distributed trait. 

(For the record I think ""intelligence"" both as how we measure it and what it is, is not directly correlated with wealth or mobility. I don't think this is very relative here, but I don't think we've constructed a system that effectively or consistently can identify or filter for the extremes of the normal curve that we want. But I'm just spitballing here, it's just my opinion.)

&amp;#x200B;

4) Jewish and Asian American populations are unique in that they have already passed through a filter to get here. In other words those are incredibly unique populations. Also, while both groups do have a higher mean, you will find that there is still a ""glass ceiling"" which exists. We may see pockets of these populations doing well, but in the majority of economic spaces we still see these groups being drastically underrepresented and underpaid. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;geniuses will end up overrepresented among the rich while those with mental illnesses or innately low intelligence will end up overrepresented among the poor. This seems a lot like what we actually observe.

&amp;#x200B;

No, what we observe is a distribution of wealth along racial lines. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I think back to the topic at hand about AR: In a perfect world with zero racism, we'd still see a normal distribution of abilities. And like you said in your last point we're definitely going to see those who's innate ability is skewed on the left side of a normal curve. It's the obligation of those on the positive tail of the normal curve, and society in general, to provide a safety net and a path to a meaningful life for those who are born without helpful traits that we were privileged to have - by our birth alone.",1560006139,{},eqemhma,False,t3_bxx9ln,False,True,t1_eqearhd,/r/philosophy/comments/bxx9ln/philosophy_shrugged_ignoring_ayn_rand_wont_make/eqemhma/,1560006151.0,1,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0.0,,,,1560232438.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advocating for complete abolition of abortion is to be willfully ignorant of circumstances half the population may find themselves in. It attempts to impose a flawed view of when human life begins upon the rest of society that would place an undue burden on those of us who don’t agree with that narrative.

But on the opposite end of the spectrum, those advocating for no state constraints placed on “on demand abortion” are also scum. Medically necessary abortion later in the pregnancy is sometimes required in cases of fetal non- viability or maternal health. That is a medically necessary procedure. However “on demand abortion” at 30 weeks is barbaric. The argument that “that is only a minutiae of abortion cases” shouldn’t dictate the state making a law preventing those circumstances. 

My wife, who is definitely pro-choice,is subbed to an abortion subreddit and a validated user recently posted their story about becoming pregnant and hemming and hawing a few weeks, deciding on whether to keep the pregnancy. She decided to abort at 12 weeks,but struggled going through with it. At 32 weeks, she finally decided it was time, and had to travel to Mexico to get her elective abortion. She talked about enjoying her pregnancy but knowing it wasn’t the “right time yet”... all while sharing details about her now dead son’s developed facial features.

,bob_2048,,,[],,,,text,t2_16gczn,False,,"Reading this interview I had the constant impression that common sense was sent flying out the window. From a starting point that seems valid to me (many philosophers really ought to abandon their propositional approaches of belief/intention/desire), the interviewee makes increasingly enormous logical leaps, dismissing entire disciplines in the process:

&gt;***why is it pointless trying to figure out what the Kaiser was thinking in the First World War?***  
&gt;  
&gt;**AR:** It’s pointless because the Kaiser wasn’t  thinking about anything at all when he gave the “blank-check” to the  Austrians. He didn’t have any desires about how matters should turn out,  or any beliefs about how to organize things to make them turn out that  way. He didn’t because no one has such thoughts with content. Of course  people have thoughts, mostly non-conscious and not available to  introspection, and these thoughts are neural processes that drive  behavior (without having any content themselves of course), including  what the Kaiser did. But trying to locate what he believed and wanted,  even roughly and inexactly, in contentless neural circuitry firing, is a  fool’s errand.

Sure, history cannot be understood *only/exclusively* by trying to understand what leaders are thinking. Likewise (sorry for the ""partisan"" example; I think it is nonetheless helpful) you can't make sense of Trump's administration by simply considering Trump's personality (he's likely just completely narcissistic): you have to consider the environment in which Trump evolves, which guides Trump to adopt strategies that will win him allies, and thus forces Trump to act in ways that relate in interesting ways to political and geopolitical considerations, even if Trump himself might not care about that stuff.

But it is insanity to just claim that we can and should abandon all consideration of the thought-process of individuals (motives, beliefs, plans, whatever other constructs you want to use). The only way this can be defended is by cherrypicking examples - the Kaiser for WWI, Talleyrand a bit later. But when you look at Hitler, Stalin, Robespierre, or even Trump as in the example above, to just pick a few, it's obvious that the beliefs and motives of individuals *also* matter, also help in understanding history and learning from it. You can't understand Nazi Germany without understanding beliefs in racial superiority. You can't explain it ***purely*** based on Guns, Germs, and Steel. To try to deny this altogether as a factor is obviously absurd.

How do we end up in the bizarre situation of an academic denying the obvious? Note how the argument works - Rosenberg builds a strawman, transforming ""what the kaiser was thinking"" to ""what the kaiser was thinking *about*"" and then attacking the concept of intentionality/mental representation, i.e., aboutness. This is a play on words more so than it is an argument.

The same applies for much of the interview. Cognitive science is dismissed based on the misrepresentation (shared with PMS Hacker and, ironically, Searle) that cognitive science altogether is completely reliant on these notions of mental representations and intentionality. Incidentally, I agree that intentionality à la Searle is utter nonsense. It just seems to me that Rosenberg is way too eager to dismiss anything that has ever touched intentionality, as if there was nothing else holding together history or cognitive science or much of philosophy of mind.",1543090043,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eadsw1n,False,t3_9zw24i,,True,t3_9zw24i,/r/philosophy/comments/9zw24i/how_history_gets_things_wrong_3am_interview_with/eadsw1n/,1545992258.0,2,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,,1543091094.0,,,,0.0,1490343920.0,True,False,,0.0,1.0,50856.0,r/philosophy,public,,

&gt;The second problem with AR rifles is the velocity of the bullet.  (Not the weapon type).  When it hits a human body the wound is unlike anything out there.

Not true according to available ballistics information on a variety of round types.

&gt;So, while banning AR rifles will not all together stop mass shootings it gives those who are in one a fighting chance.

Like at Columbine? I don't see how shotguns are less dangerous to victims than an AR-15 except at long range, which describes a small minority of shooting events. Not to mention that not all AR-15 rifles are chambered for 5.56/.223, and many non-AR rifles are chambered for those rounds. Additionally, AR-15 rifles are the most common kind of rifle in the US, and are the practical definition of ""common use,"" the category of arms protected by the Heller decision that upheld the 2nd Amendment. Banning them is, in the foreseeable future, not going to go well with the Supreme Court.

We had an assault weapons ban In place for years and while it did not eliminate mass shootings all together it greatly decreased the body count. 

The second problem with AR rifles is the velocity of the bullet.  (Not the weapon type).  When it hits a human body the wound is unlike anything out there. Normally victims bleed to death. This why the AR type rifle is a force multiplayer when it comes to mass shootings. You don’t have to place a perfectly aimed shot to rack up a kill. 

So, while banning AR rifles will not all together stop mass shootings it gives those who are in one a fighting chance. 

I remember when I first joined the Army (21 years ago) and we were starting BRM (Basic Rifle Marksmanship).  We were told the design of the M16 was not to kill directly. But wound an enemy combatant in hopes his buddy will have to carry him making them both targets of opportunity. 

As far as arming guards at every event and school. People tend to forget when a shooter has made their mind up, there is no amount of deterrence that will stop them. They know they will die and are probably hoping to

,AnarAchronist,,,[],,,,text,t2_43j8iir,False,,"&gt;Councils and organization is completely fine, in fact anarchy in many cases is actually a lot more organized than other forms of government, people have a very flawed perception of it very often and think it's literally just people running around doing whatever the hell they want- which isn't the case. 

Youre issue then would be scalability. From what i can see youre in support of a bottom-up, naturally emerging hierarchy however, as youve read Marx' theory of history youd recognise this as primitive communism.

Theres a reason why primitive communism gives way to feudalism.

Where marx gets it wrong is assuming history was about the evolution of the state and material wealth when its actually about the emergence of the individual from the collective.

You can actually read all of Marx history from the angle of the individual. Primitive communism starts with the need for local chieftains and elders which then gives way to the first individuals under feudalism (kings, pharaohs, priests).

What matters is not the accumulation of wealth but the emergence of 'I' which is a priori to ownership.

Following feudalism comes the emergence of dukes, lords and merchant class under proto-capitalism. Here the king is no longer the sovereign individual but must make way for the emergence of other individuals. This is also why we see events like the magna carta.

Reformation/renaissance/enlightenment roles around classical liberals start asking what a state would look like if all people could become individuals. Universal suffrage is finally won for women.

Preceding and also developing alongside classical liberalism however Socialism evolves into ideas of class struggle through Marxism however rather than approach statecraft from the angle of the individual Marx sees a return to collectives but organised globally without any states.

This is evident by Marx' vision on a communist utopia as man simply being in harmony with nature and fellow man. Presumably the correct behaviour just rises up and it turns out to be universally compatible with everybody elses behaviour. There is no room for difference thereforr there is no room for the individual. So long as there is differences in opinion there must a regulatory body which itself is government. If a person chooses not to adhere to the rules then he is exiled (or killed) which re-establishes the boundaries of the state.

If classical liberalism was focused on the evolution of the individual before the state, Marx has focused on the evolution of the state before the individual. This is why Marxism and Classical Liberalism is fundamentally opposed. There is simply no room for the individual. 

I think in many ways Hegel gets the last laugh here because there is a dialectic between collectivism and individualism

The synthesis is not to return to collectivism and ignore individualism. Individualism by itself appears to be giving rise to something else. I would guess its a kind of pluralism. Thanks to the internet individuals are now divided and can take on many personas. Trends in fashion, taste, beliefs and behaviours appear to be anachronistic. We have flat earthers for example. 

Modernism appears to have been the era of the individual. If youre Habermas then you would say its an unfinished project however i dont think post-modernism was an accident. Post-modernism may have fractured the individual in order to see what might emerge but it also runs the risk of losing the individual back in to the collective.

When people are afraid they revert back to collectives for security. If people feel safe (in western countries) they express their individuality. But what comes after individuality? 

Getting back to my earlier point i think Marx' theory of history is wrong. It does not make sense that we just return to a scaled up collective. I think the emergence of the individual is the dialectical 'other' for collectivism. I think man at present has a foot in both camps even in individualist societies but that any real synthesis will be something that maintains both and produces something greater. This will probably look like a divided self.

I see technology as being a necessary medium for this new ontology. Cryptocurrencies will allow people to join collectives, exercise individual capitalist autonomy and possibly other ways of functioning materialistically in the world. Google bubbles will continue and get more advanced when AR finally arrives. People will literally live in different realities. Two people will exist in the same place at the same time and have completely different experiences.

This wont be achieved through greater centralisation but the inverse; complete disintegration/decentralisation. But it turns out an infinitely large circle and infinitely small point are the same thing. Marx' ultimate communist utopia - the idea of behaviours just emerging and people living without the need for a state - may technically still occur, they just wont be in a collective but more like Nietzschean Ubermensch.

Also a totalitarian socialist state wont be required to facilitate it. Just people constantly demanding new things to decorate their sense of individuality.

The problem will be making this transition too fast. If it happens too fast people will become afraid and retreat in to collectives. If it happens at the pace it has been for the last 70 years then it should only take another 50 in western countries and 150 in other parts of the world.

A characteristic of post-truth is the battle over terminology: what exactly is an ""assault rifle""? People who are dishonest will attempt to change the definition either way.

and 
&gt;A macaque can no more consider its options than we can debate whether to conform with gravity.

I don't believe these statements (the antecedent in your first) are true, though. Mainly because absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and recent animal research has often conflicted with people's prior beliefs about animals, so it seems we've been systematically underestimating them. I think there's actual evidence, although not conclusive, to reject the statements, see my comment with apparent examples of animals acting morally (including macaques, specifically) in my first reply to you in this thread. Also, [some (inconclusive) evidence for theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind_in_animals). 

&gt; then all the effort AR advocates put in to attacking the boundary between us and animals is pointless, or what's worse, risks romanticising nature, an ideologically risky direction to take.

I don't think this follows, because I believe nonhuman animals are often at least moral patients or subjects (going back to the argument from marginal cases), even if they aren't moral agents. 

Now, even if you consider the possibility that they aren't moral patients/subjects, the risks of you being wrong look much worse to me. I'm very unsure of the sentience of some of the animals I defend, but the potential harm we cause to them outweighs our gain, in my view. In particular, I'm living in good health as a vegan, and you probably can, too. You can consider your behaviours on a case-by-case basis, too; there are utilitarians who eat as vegans for animals but still support animal experimentation, at least in principle, because of its potential benefits. How do you weight the two risks, given the probabilities you assign to each? 

&gt;It looks that way from here. Crudely put, the proposition looks something like: ""If sentient, by objective standard x, then has moral worth.""

I don't think anyone has any ""objective standard x"" they could cite here, and I don't think they ever will; maybe some are convinced of it, though. My impression is that they usually either simply assert that sentient beings have moral worth (e.g. if they're moral realists), or they ask why this shouldn't be the case and challenge the lines people draw between humans and nonhuman animals. They start from the assumption that the person they're trying to reach values others inherently, but without at least that, there's nowhere to go. I don't see how I can convince someone to care about any other individual inherently if they don't already. 

&gt;That's just the tip of a much larger societal iceberg, though, I'm sure you would agree?

Sure, people don't exist in vacuums, but the beliefs are held by individuals, as separate conscious beings. 

&gt;If it were purely subjective, there would be no standpoint from which to offer any critique - self-consistency would just be a value you value more or less than others do.

Well, most people probably do value self-consistency or can convinced to (not necessarily by argument), so I can offer critique this way. If they don't and can't be convinced to, then, sure, there's no grounding for critique. 

&gt;Which more fundamental beliefs are you referring to, here?

Sorry for the ambiguous phrasing, I meant my own beliefs. The actual beliefs are tangential to our metaethical discussion, though, but they are the belief that other animals are likely to be sentient and that suffering and preferences matter, no matter who experiences them. I also believe that similar suffering among more is worse than among fewer, all else equal.

&gt;I'm noting how it works, for us, in our culture, as opposed to, say, how animals might be treated in certain Amazonian cultures. I guess underlying that is my more fundamental belief about this being a game among men, not a game between us and nature.

Okay. What about normative/moral beliefs, too, then? What do you value, at a fundamental level? Well, I suppose you answer this next with ""progress for us"". 

&gt;I focus on what is in the interests of progress for us, as best I'm able.

And of course, here I would ask you to define ""us"" and ask why you draw the line there, and not elsewhere, with the argument from marginal cases as a starting point. I'm not asking you to defend it now, since this particular discussion is metaethical, so it's besides the point.

This observation is more 'loaded' than you seem to notice. If moral values are exclusively human constructs - if humans are unique in this *qualitative* way - then all the effort AR advocates put in to attacking the boundary between us and animals is pointless, or what's worse, risks *romanticising* nature, an ideologically risky direction to take.

&gt;It's not about about looking for a scientific basis for a moral absolute;

It *looks* that way from here. Crudely put, the proposition looks something like: ""*If* sentient, by objective standard *x*, *then* has moral worth."" It seems very like an attempt to ground right action in natural science, as a means to arrive at a settled conclusion in our political games.

&gt; morality, to me, is just individuals' subjective preferences, 

That's just the tip of a much larger societal iceberg, though, I'm sure you would agree? If it were purely subjective, there would be no standpoint from which to offer any critique - self-consistency would just be a value you value more or less than others do. For me, morality is [EDIT -dropped a phrase, here] more socially- than individually-founded.

&gt;and nonhuman animals generally cannot argue about these in the abstract like us. 

Statements like this are what suggest to me that you're underestimating the significance of our unique qualities as moral agents. The capacity to argue about our options *presupposes* our capacity to make informed choices. A macaque can no more consider its options than we can debate whether to conform with gravity.

&gt;However, ethics, to me, is mainly about getting people to justify their actions and the lines they draw, to make their preferences and intuitions actually well-informed and consistent; or, to quote Wikipedia: ""Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct."" 

This is uncontroversial, though I note it is possible to act morally without an advanced degree in ethics.

&gt;I think our treatment of animals is a blind spot here, and because of more fundamental beliefs, I believe the impact of this blind spot is extremely negative. 

Which more fundamental beliefs are you referring to, here?

&gt;Are you taking it for granted that mistreating proxies for our inter-human relations is bad or that these objects or animals should be proxies at all, or are there more fundamental beliefs, both descriptive and normative, that underlie this? 

I'm noting how it works, for us, in our culture, as opposed to, say, how animals might be treated in certain Amazonian cultures. I guess underlying that is my more fundamental belief about this being a game among men, not a game between us and nature. I'm wary of universalising what might seem obvious to us in our Western value system.

&gt;Do you side with whoever's winning the game without challenging its outcome?

I focus on what is in the interests of progress for us, as best I'm able. When I see something I suspect of having reactionary implications, as I do with the AR lobby, I challenge it.

&gt; It sounds like you're succumbing to [is-ought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem), but I assume you are willing to question and justify your beliefs and actions, and change them in light of evidence or any possible inconsistencies with or in your more fundamental beliefs.

The point is to explore what grounds we have for considering human agency and consciousness to be *qualitatively* distinct from that of other animals, *as opposed to* a matter of quantities on a continuum.

I appreciate that Singer and others have done a great job with marginal cases at the low end of human capacity and the high end of higher mammal capacity, to argue that there is no such boundary. That has caused more confusion than enlightenment, in my view. Yet AR advocates remain (rightly, in some ways) only concerned with regulating the behaviour of one species, humans. So both 'sides' in this debate therefore operate under some awareness that the moral game among humans is distinct and unique.

As per the other twig of this thread, I suggest entertaining the possibility of that qualitative boundary existing, as a hypothetical, and considering what it would imply for discussing our relation to animals. To my mind, it's a clarifying step. It allows those for whom such things matter to focus on the strong welfare case, pragmatically, and drop the more far-fetched social demands that have taken animal advocacy from the mainstream it inhabited in the 19th and much of the 20th century towards becoming a fringe concern.

""What is the role of a philosopher of science? (00:19)'

There ar ereally two things we call philosophy. One of those things is something very much like what people think it is, the abstract contemplation of reality. The other thing is really more like joining mensa when you are 14 and then finding out the hard way that the whole point of mensa is to make sure smart people never put their minds on anything that MATTERS... but instead consuming their time with endless and pointless masturbatory abstractions.

The former philosopher expands the horizons of science and knowledge by taking what science absolutely does know and then asking thought experiment questions about that; guesswork but highly evolved and highly informed guesswork with a very accurate model of reality. The latter is literally some part of the drag co-efficient on intellectual life generally speaking in society.


""How does quantum mechanics contradict common sense? (07:48)""

Multiple ways primarily extending out of non locality and quantum information. common Sense can handle the world of mass which turns out to be an illusion, and the physics of that once understood deeply reflect the obvious sense of order we subjectively experience. The reverse is true of QM. The more you learn about it the more it defies and sabotages and complicates any kind of intuitive feeling for the how the universe operates according to subjective experience.

If we lived at the quantum level, we would experience a universe in which everything is randomly teleporting into place where a probability vector field intersects some other probability vector field. The particle only exists when the wave form collapses. 



""Can science give us a precise image of the universe? (18:06)""

what do you mean by precise? Objectivity/ subjectivity is well understood to be a spectrum. You can improve your model and it can become a good enough model to achieve technological effects, but science will always be  an abstract and conceptual tool and map of reality. Not reality. So if you mean absolute precision- no it can never achieve that. But it can become MORE precise in degrees, and that can build up to being VERY accurate over time- But precision like perfection in science is something to strive for but which can never actually be literally obtained. Like evolution or nested basement universes, theres always some new level to hop into or down into or out of.



""Can you give a brief overview of quantum mechanics? (22:57)""

Mass equalls energy. Mass happens on a very subjective scale- the scale of our subjective experience. Mass is composed of energy, and in essence more precisely of entangled quantum particles orbiting each other. The scale of energy is vastly smaller than the scale of mass, but Mass in essence = energy once you zoom down into that scale. Energy does the same thing again tho. The scale of energy is vast compared to the scale of quantum probability fields, which are what actually composes energy. If you zoom down in scale small enough, you can see that everything is composed of nothing solid and even energy is composed of potential probability fields. But now we zoom down smaller another level of scale and probability fields are the macros of quantum information; So theres actually crazy amounts of entirely virtual DATA down there at the smallest scale...Now that all is a given. Whats smaller? The theories aren't sure. 1001 denominations of QM are even now fighting over whose model is right. There is math and actual observational lab work to get data from- but what does the data MEAN?

In theory, the data suggest that the next smaller scale is quantum strings, and then the next smaller scale is the quantum singularity- and the string is a standing wave emanating out of and generated by the standing wave geometry as the friction that is caused between singularity and BRANE. Each type of quantum information ""particle"" or any given kind of string is dependent on the brane substrate that the singularity has agitated.  At the smallest scale, the universe is hyperlocations of the actual core cosmic singularity; spread out into a brane tree which creates from our perspective the illusions of space and time.



""How might we establish the truth of string theory? (29:00)""

punch a hole in a brane using highly modulated electromagnetic fields as standing waves using highly erratic and thus hyper dimensional frequentia geometries.


""Does quantum mechanics speak at all to consciousness? (31:11)""

Whose interpretation of QM.? theres semi newtonian clockwork atheist QM and then theres full on Shamanism Reborn QM. Which flavor of QM would you like this report from?

If you understand brain wave states and the quantum implications of that in the brain- you are well on your way to establishing an absolutely science centered religious system which delivers on every real promise of religion but minus all the sheeple herding, nonsense, and woo.




""What are some of the most prevalent misinterpretations of science today? (37:06)""

My favorite pick is the lack of causal thinking. The general public of sophomoric thinking has adopted a skeptical scientificish sort of reasoning where it ""demands references"" This is actually in many instances just babble appeal from authority. If a person can give you scientific causal reasoning, and walk you through the understanding of it, then it should be on the other persons dime to go run the search engines. Real science reasoning does not require us to do stupid and pointless experiments. It builds models and the models become more and more accurate and more and more predictive. The general public can't reason with cause and effect or apply the model- They can only seem to reason by reference- proof from some authority figure. That in turn only sets up an elite centered dumble down to be particularly effective.

Very often scientists of very high calibre suffer seriously from dunning kruger effect outside of their fields. For instance, carl sagans ideas about consciousness and religion are idiotic from a depth psychology perspective. Bill nye the science guy should have looked up horizontal genetic transfer before reversing his opinion on GMOs. These people commit layman level fallacies but pass it off as scientific because they have advanced knowledge in some areas.. but not the area they are commenting on. This is the true danger really of just asking QM what it thinks of consciousness. Unless the QM expert has Studied psychology and consciousness, their answer is one half ignorant babbling.



""How is our everyday notion of time flawed? (41:29)""

time is not linear its explosive. Every possible outcome has a universe to land in as home. We experience a linear flow of time- but outside of our subjective experience, time forked in every possible direction. This makes contemporary ideas about time travel quite impossible, because you can never actually time travel- you can only create new forks on the many worlds tree.

,Aziziskov,,,,,,,,,,,"More emphasis on your statement is that Islam teaches us that God can be known through four essential statements.

Chapter 112.
&gt;1. Qol Howa Allah-ho 'Ahd*. ( Say that: God is One )
&gt;2. Allah-os-Samad**. ( God is the one Whom all depend on )
&gt;3. Lam Yalid wa Lam Yowlad. (He begets not, nor is He begotten.)
&gt;4. Wa lam Yakon-L-Lahu Kofow-an 'Ahd. ( And there isn't anyone who is rivalling or of similar equivalence to him )

*'Ahd here is used as an adjective, which is a very rare occurrence in arabic. Also it is a different word from Wahid (Wahid means ""One"") yet they have the same root. 'Ahd here means the absolute unique one. The term Wahid was also used to describe God in a different context. Chapter 2.

&gt;163.'Ilahokom 'Ilahon Wahid (Your God is a One God), La ilaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), AR-Rahman-o-AR-Raheem ( the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.)

'Ahd is also used in the fourth verse but as a noun, in normal context it means somebody or someone.

**Samad has potentially many meanings, if you describe a man with the adjective Samad, then you mean this man is very tough and able to stand still without needing anything from anyone. 

These four phrases from the Qur'an encompass anything that is said about God.

**First**: he is indeed one and ONLY one, he is not a group of gods, nor is he part of a trinity. He is an absolute entity of existence, excluded from having partner or spouse or companion or anyone, no one completes him, he is complete without any external help of anything or anybody.

A human being is indeed one, i am one, you are one, she is one. Although i am composed of a heart that pumps blood, a stomach that digests food, a brain that does the thinking, limbs that move and extend. God is an absolute one also means he isn't composed of different parts or different entities or different forms which came together resulting in him.

**Second**: Everyone seeks him when in need, because he is the one that needs no one to exist. He is fully and completely able to sustain himself and continue to exist. He isn't ever in different states, he doesn't get hungry then eat to become full, he doesn't get tired then rest to regain his strength. 


**Third**: He did not inherit his reign over the entire universe and whats beyound it from someone who existed before him, nor is his rule going to be given to someone or somebody after him. He has always existed, and will always exist as the one and only ultimate entity above everything. Nothing will ever surpass him or cause him to weaken or lose.

Mankind and other living beings need to procreate and reproduce in order to sustain their species, God is not in need of such thing to sustain himself. 


**Fourth**: Him and his attributes and features cannot be compared to anything. He is the most knowledgable, If the entire collective knowledge of all humankind was placed on one end of a scale, and God's knowledge was placed on the other, it would be an understatement to say that is like comparing the mass of an atom and the mass of the entire universe. Same thing goes to his other attributes, his mercy, his forgiveness, his might &amp; strength, his beauty and the list goes on.

If you have found any description of any living form of existence, and it doesn't match these four essential statements, then this existence is not what God is.

If you can observe it by any sense of yours or through any technology that makes it possible to observe the unseen &amp; unheard, then it is definitely not God. If you can compare it to anything that you have ever thought of, then it is not God.

We lose the parts of our culture that allow us to develop creativity because all our needs are taken care of.  If necessity is the mother of invention and necessity is on its deathbed, we lose a large part of the incentive to be creative. 

At the same time, technology exponentially develops and reduces the barriers to creative expression.  Increasing population means more people are trying to express themselves and they're better at it because it's easier and cheaper. This means that it's impossible to distinguish ourselves or our expression from others in any meaningful way. I can demonstrate that without relying on arguments about AI becoming more creative and expressive than the human mind.

Eventually, without regard to the specific implementation of the technology du jour, whether it's VR or AR or a neural interface, we are doomed to morphing into a society where creativity is dead.  At this point, it will be painfully, viscerally evident that everything that can be done has been done before. So there is no motivation for creativity.

entirely subjective and private? Iser acknowledges that what is private is the reader’s
eventual incorporation of the text “into his own treasure-house of experience” (AR,
24). However, such arbitrariness is limited by the fact that the act of understanding a
text is “intersubjective”: though readers may draw very different conclusions from
what they read, they will often respond to the same things: “a literary text contains
intersubjectively verifiable instructions for meaning-production, but the meaning produced
may then lead to a whole variety of different experiences and hence subjective
judgments” (AR, 25). The point is that the process of “meaning-production” itself will occur within a range limited by the textual structures; different readers may then draw
widely diverging conclusions from this range of meanings. Iser sees this intersubjective
model of reading as an advance over objectivist theories which presume that a text
itself contains a single hidden meaning or set of meanings that can be discovered by
the critic.

&gt; ""So the answer to sexual harassment is...growing a tougher skin? Are you serious?""

No, the answer to women being afraid to study philosophy simply because at some university some _other_ woman was raped and she happened to be a philosophy student as well, the answer to _that_ would be to grow a tougher skin. Solving sexual harassment in society at large is an entirely different discussion, which in my opinion has nothing to do with philosophy students specifically. If you're going to stop yourself doing something you would love to do, simply because sexual harassment can pop up anywhere in society, you're going to be limiting your own options severely and unnecessarily. Regardless of your gender. I would argue that the last thing that will help you is whining and complaining about it on some random WordPress 'safe' echo-chamber.

Yes, a stove is more dangerous than a knife. The danger involved is not merely the severity of a potential injury, but the ease with which a severe injury could occur. A child needs only to touch a stove to sustain a severe injury, whereas a child must actually pick up and handle a knife in order to cut her artery open.

You don't seem to be thinking though your own position here. You should work on that.

&gt; What does the potential risk to an unsupervised child have to do with the practical effects of knives and guns on society, particularly when most deaths arise from suicide and assault, not accidental death?

Case in point. The potential risk to a somewhat unsupervised child is pertinent to the danger posed by a thing, which is presumably a practical effect on society. In your haste to make some startling point here, you also unwittingly noted that ""most deaths [from knives or firearms] arise from suicide and assault, not accidental death,"" yet in the citation-free figures you reference concerning motor vehicle fatalities, *virtually all of those are accidental*. So apparently the practical effects on society are more realized, on your view, when the violence is *intentional* -- so what's the problem with limiting those unwanted practical effects via regulation?

&gt; &gt; It is not at all clear that restricting firearm use harms liberty or reduces self-defense.

&gt; No reasons given, the conclusion is again merely assumed.

I don't think you understand. When I say ""it is not at all clear that,"" I am noting that I see no reason to accept *your* claim, and I am inviting you to provide a reason. Perhaps you are unfamiliar with actual philosophical discussion, but this is a common turn of phrase. Your accusation is amusing, as it properly applies to you, not me.

&gt; Ignoring the liberty question, how could you possibly argue that banning firearms doesn't harm self defense?

First, a firearm is not a defensive weapon, but an offensive one. Granted, it can be used in this capacity to deter or disable (including kill) a would-be assailant, and in that respect it could be considered a 'self-defense' tool, but let us be clear: it is an offensive weapon.

Second, when did I *ever* say we should ban firearms? Look again. I'll wait.

&gt; A woman of 100 pounds [blah blah drivel drivel]. . .

Yes, restricting firearm use does not reduce or harm self-defense, *provided* that the restrictions are reasonable, which I daresay they are. If we implemented restrictions comparable to those applied to motor vehicles, clearly most 100lb. women could still have a firearm.

&gt; What about the elderly, or disabled, or those attacked by more than one assailant? In each of those situations a gun would drastically increase their ability to defend themselves. . .

Sure, sure. So would a grenade. Should we remove restrictions on those, too? How about a nice shaped charge like a Claymore mine? Should we decline to require any training or competence testing? GTFO.

&gt; The term ""well regulated"" as used in the Second Amendment does not have the same meaning as we would use those terms to mean today. The term regulated was in that era used as a synonym for trained or practiced, not the term limited.

So you don't think that requirements concerning training and practice are *limits*? Go on...

&gt; The Supreme Court covered this with a historical analysis in the Heller case.

That's right, and in it the majority opinion stated, ""the adjective 'well-regulated' implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training."" That is, a demonstration of proper discipline and training as a condition of exercising the right to keep and bear arms is not a proper infringement of that right, but a condition encapsulated in the very text which grants it.

---

My argument is simple:

1. We accept that motor vehicle ownership and operation should be restricted to persons of a certain age who have demonstrated an understanding of local traffic laws by way of a knowledge test, who have demonstrated competency with a legally operated motor vehicle by way of an applied skills test, and who have demonstrably accurate vision at a specified level according to a visual acuity test.

2. If something designed for an explicitly innocuous purpose and in fact used almost exclusively in that capacity is appropriately restricted as in (1), then surely something designed for the express purpose of killing and in fact used almost exclusively in that capacity or in a capacity meant to train for or perfect that use should also be subjected to analogous restrictions.

3. Therefore, we should accept restrictions on firearm ownership and operation analogous to the restrictions imposed on motor vehicle ownership and operation.

Appeals to the Constitution are irrelevant. That document can be and has changed -- indeed, among its changes *just is* the provision to keep and bear arms under discussion -- and while the court which interprets its contents ostensibly provides opinions based in fact, logic, and reason, it is nonetheless clearly the case that as the times and court's constituents change, so, too, can the rulings.

We can quibble about just when something is deemed dangerous enough to regulate, or just what counts as the proper design or effective use of a thing, and we can argue over whether owning a firearm is a 'fundamental right' or not, or whether 'driving a car' is itself a 'fundamental right' (or at least comparable to a right to bear arms), but ultimately if you accept existing regulations concerning firearm ownership (or ownership of weapons in general) -- and you do, at least for the most part -- and if you accept regulations concerning motor vehicle operation -- and again, you do -- then we are really only arguing about *just when* those restrictions should apply, and *how restrictive* they should be. I do not wish to have my AR-15 confiscated, but I am happy to submit myself to various tests concerning my knowledge of that firearm, my safety practices, and an applied skills test. I am further happy to subject myself to a mental health exam, and to subject my weapon -- as I do my vehicle -- to annual or biannual inspections, including renewal of a license for the weapon as well as for myself.

If we define it or narrow our focus to capture the specific ills brought about by readily available firearms, it's fairly simple to recognize that while all violent crimes would not be eliminated (whether they would even be reduced is perhaps an open question), mass shootings would almost certainly be reduced, if we were to simply restrict if not eliminate legal firearm possession.

Why should we care about mass shootings? There are over 1 million violent crimes per year (https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/violent-crime-topic-page/violentcrimemain_final) but only about 16 mass shootings per year (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/25shooters.html?_r=0).

They're good news fodder, but irrelevant practically. Almost no one dies from mass shootings. If decreasing total harm is your goal, it's not even in the picture.

&gt;On that note, I say all of this as an owner of an 'assault weapon' (AR-15 with various attachments and magazines holding no fewer than 20 rounds), but I nonetheless expect it is not merely reasonable but appropriate to enact restrictions on firearms which are at least as strict as those pertaining to motor vehicles. 

Assault weapon is a fishy term not worthy of use, but I'll disregard that point for now. 

&gt;Vehicles, it turns out, are designed for one specific reason: to transport persons or goods. Firearms are also designed for one specific reason, albeit a much more nefarious one: to kill something or someone. 

This point is false for a number of reasons. First, firearms aren't designed to kill any more than cars are designed to crash. Both *can* be used in those ways, both often *are* put to that test, but neither is designed as such. Some ammunition is designed specifically to disable or rend flesh (which are tantamount to killing), but beyond altering caliber, guns can't be ""designed to kill."" Guns are merely designed to fire and cycle ammunition. Moreover, even if a gun was ""designed to kill,"" why would that be relevant? Knives are designed specifically to cut and rend flesh, but you're of course not going to suggest that we have motor-vehicle like regulations on all knives. 

Moreover, why should the purpose of a firearm be more important than the human rights which undergird its ownership? Cars are not fundamental to ordered liberty, they are not protected in the Constitution, and generally aren't used to protect and guarantee freedom from oppression (whether governmental, spousal, etc). Even assuming that firearms are more dangerous than motor vehicles (and, per the numbers of gun/car deaths per year, they aren't), how would you justify placing more stringent restrictions on something so important to liberty and self-defense, both fundamental rights of men?

,cabbagery,,,,,,,,t2_6g69u,,,"&gt; I'm fairly certain that an armed population is the biggest deterrent keeping the govt from amping up the police state.

For better or for worse, you're mistaken.

When the Second Amendment was ratified in the US, the most advanced weaponry available to both citizen and state consisted of muskets, flintlocks, and cannon. If this trend had continued -- if private citizens could today legally own even the most advanced weaponry -- your point might stand, but for better or for worse, private citizens may only with great difficulty acquire fully automatic small arms, and they may not acquire working platforms such as tanks, fighter or bomber aircraft, artillery, etc. I admit I don't know if crew-served weapons are in principle able to be acquired, but clearly missiles and especially NBC weapons (nuclear, biological, chemical) are forbidden to the public. Even conventional munitions with industrial uses (read: dynamite, det-chord, etc.) are heavily regulated.

So while it could be -- was! -- true that an armed citizenry could withstand the state, that is simply no longer the case. My AR-15 is ineffective against an armored vehicle of any kind.

Now, if you oppose the govvernment's monopoly on advanced weaponry (read: more combat-effective than small arms or crew served weapons), you are at least consistent, but at what cost? Would you actually support the idea that your neighbor could own a fully functional Bradley Fighting Vehicle, an Apache attack helicopter, or NBC munitions? Presumably not, so you would therefore *support* restricting advanced weaponry to the government, effectively rendering useless virtually every available armament normal citizens could own.

The rub here is that the government *is* the people; those who actually have access to these advanced platforms *are* your neighbors. It turns out that if we encourage a strong education in ethics, responsibility, and accountability (not just education, but something with teeth), our concerns can at least be mitigated if not addressed satisfactorily. I once had access to advanced weaponry, and I'm here to tell you I would have refused any order to use it on private citizens. I was not alone. Unfortunately, there are plenty who *would* obey those sorts of orders, and that's an object lesson in our failure to educate in the manner just described.

Sure, stabbings and beatings -- including fatal versions of each -- might increase, but clearly it is harder to visit these sorts of violence upon multiple victims, and to realize multiple victims (or even but one or two, especially in the case of beatings) would clearly require groups of aggressors rather than a 'lone gunman.'

,Steve132,,,,,,,,t2_4m6v4,,,"&gt; 1) a lot of human activity is independent of the physical medium employed, so it would be very strange if there were laws of physics entailing those activities,

Either the human brain is a system dependent on the laws of physics (e.g, made of atoms and subject to fundamental forces), or it is not (e.g., there is a supernatural force outside of the laws of physics like a soul).   Obviously if you believe in souls my argument does not apply, but I did mention that.

&gt;2) the physicists are themselves human, if their behaviour is entailed by the laws they use, then they would be able to, in principle, predict their own behaviour, but this can be shown to be inconsistent with the assumptions of empirical science, including physics

If you are talking about general psychology then that's irrelevant to what I'm talking about unless the psychologist is an omnipotent computer running a simulation of the entire universe.  If you are talking about the incompleteness principle, that doesn't apply here because the machine isn't emulating itself, it's emulating strictly other machines in simulated universes so it's not an inconsistency problem.  If you are talking about the non-determinism inherent to quantum mechanics, this is a more interesting objection, but a Quantum-UTM can emulate any quantum system, including the universe, and a UTM can emulate a Q-UTM (albeit exponentially slowly).

&gt;3) laws of physics are mathematical abstractions that allow us to predict what will follow if we perform certain actions, this allows us to control, to some extent, our environment, this seems to be incompatible with the notion that it's actually the environment that controls us,

This is vague enough that I have no idea what you are actually claiming.  However, I'm making no claim about whether or not we are controlling or controlled by our environment.   My claim is very simple, I'll reiterate it below.

&gt; 4)  laws of physics apply to a small range of phenomena when dealt with by a small range of methods, they tell us nothing about what is outside those ranges. 

Regardless of whether or not science has actually discovered the mechanisms describing the function of the universe at a subatomic level %100, there is absolutely no reason to believe that no such mechanisms exist:  Put another way, our personal uncertainty about the laws doesn't imply that the universe could not be simulated on a turing machine.  There is no reason to believe that it cannot (unless you believe in the supernatural).

&gt; So, your reader has no obvious reason to accept the claim that ""a UTM can emulate a human brain (by simulation of the physics of the universe)"".

If the reader believes that the brain is purely material with no supernatural components (e.g, that it is built out of the structures of the laws of physics like particles and chemistry and electromagnetism and gravity), then the question of whether or not a UTM can emulate a human brain reduces to whether or not a UTM can emulate particles and chemistry and electromagnetism.  

The belief in the materialism of the brain is likely unless the reader is religious, but given my audience (/r/philosophy on reddit.com) I find that to be unlikely.  It's a fairly obvious assumption.

The question of the ability of a UTM to emulate physics, then, is in turn a question of whether or not the laws of physics 1) exist and ar consistent 2) are computable.     Again, most readers should find the claim that the universe operates according to consistent fundamental principles fairly obvious, as it is the claim that supports all of science as a philosophical pursuit.    Whether those principles are computable is a tougher question, but considering every law we've discovered so far required to simulate the universe is very very obviously computable, and that the space of non-computable functions seems to be limited to strange mathematical oddities (like the halting problem or komolgorov complexity) that don't really map to anything we observe in the universe, it seems likely to me that whatever laws we haven't discovered yet are computable.   

I'm willing to concede that, yes, my argument falls apart if we eventually learn something bizarre like that the reason why we observe wavefunction collapse is because electrons somehow solve the halting problem...but I find that as unlikely as ghosts existing.

So, in summary, brains are made up of particles and work by following the known and unknown laws of physics, so emulating a brain can be done by emulating the known and unknown laws of physics.   Emulating the known and unknown laws of physics can be done if the known and unknown laws of physics are computable, and all the known laws are, and the prospects of unknown uncomputable laws of physics is so outside the realm of what we expect to find that it's absurd.  

Therefore, yes, a non-religious person who believes in science as a worthwhile pursuit of knowledge is pretty much forced to accept that a UTM can emulate a human brain by simulation of the physics of the universe.

In 'denning' wildlife, **government agents pour kerosene into the den and then set it on fire, burning the young alive in their nests.**

Among the animals Wildlife Services agents intentionally kill are badgers, black bears, bobcats, coyotes, gray fox, red fox, mountain lions, opossum, raccoons, striped skunks, beavers, nutrias, porcupines, prairie dogs, black birds, cattle egrets, and starlings.

Just because you have no need, doesn't mean there wouldn't be value in doing it. Empathy is like math. You don't need to learn it, and you don't need to use it even if you know it, but that doesn't mean there isn't often tremendous value in doing so.

This illustrates my point on him being excluded. I don't mean they literally lock him out, only that they no longer make him feel welcome and respected. To be clear, I *don't* think he should be welcome and respected in the scientific community anymore. But imagine how it would feel to have your former colleagues feel that way about you. People you respected and trusted. He had to know that pain might be coming when he decided to adopt his new beliefs, and he did it anyway. I think it's more likely that he's courageous than that he cared nothing for the field he worked in for so long. That's not proof, but when judging another person, I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt unless I see strong evidence for the contrary. If he hated his colleagues and never really liked working at CERN, that would be a different story, because then there would be no sacrifice. But I have seen no evidence of it yet, and so I err on the side of respect.

&gt; I mean, if you clicked on a link about a man who beat his child unconscious with a skillet, would you commend him for having the balls to take a different approach to parenting?

This is an *old* approach to parenting, and one with plenty of known, well-proven, and **extremely severe** drawbacks. I don't think you'll find a doctor or scientist who would say meditation will kill you or cause serious lasting harm.

More importantly, a child is actually a parent's responsibility. Hagelin's followers are not actually his responsibility. He took no hippocratic oath. They're full-grown adults, and if he weren't around for them to buy into his nonsense, they'd just buy into someone else's. The existence of fictions and strange ideas for them to adopt is *not* the problem. The problem is that they never learned to tell truth from fiction in the first place. I would recommend that they study up on the scientific method and probability theory so they can make better choices, and that we make both of those a larger focus in standard education. But none of that is Hagelin's fault. The only harm he's responsible for is the harm to himself.

Now, if a man were to beat *himself* with a skillet in order to try to cure himself of the common cold, based on some extremely convoluted hypothesis, I *would* commend his courage and creativity, and condemn his failure to prioritize and properly vet his ideas, just as I do with Hagelin.

&gt;Exactly. Him questioning the status quo wasn't a bad thing. The mistake Haglin made was believing in nonsense, not questioning common wisdom. That's the point.

But there was no status quo being questioned. All Hagelin does here is fill in knowledge gaps with mystic bullshit. He's not going against any standard model, he's proposing a first. 

See, this is why these conversations are impossible. None of you people who defend these idiots have any clue what you're talking about. You don't even know what Hagelin is saying, yet you've created this fantasy authoritarian complex in your head that he's fighting against, as if he's some hero. He's not. He's a charlatan. 

&gt;You misunderstand. I didn't ask you to watch the video, I asked to to try asking the same question Hagelin must have asked when he first began straying from conventional wisdom. It was the fact that you implied that watching the video was sufficient to understand him that disappointed me. I got the impression that you've never seriously thought of Heglin as a person just as complex as yourself; as a fellow human being. I wanted to urge you to dispel that illusion. To empathize.

I have no need to empathize with him. He's a crook. He's a person who abuses his *perceived* authority as a scientist to trick people into believing in fantasy. There may be redeeming qualities about him--maybe he's kind to animals--but that shit isn't relevant here. He doesn't get a pass from criticism simply because he donates to charity. Nor should you expect it. And don't think I haven't noticed you attempting to invalidate those criticism by pretending they go further than they should, or that I am somehow being irrational. That is unacceptable behavior on your part, and if you're not ashamed of yourself for it, I'm ashamed of you on your behalf. 

Ironically, this helps illustrate my point: What defines him are his *ideas*. He's a crank because of what he thinks, not because of who he is. It's the fact that he can't even coherently explain his position, let alone defend it, that makes him a pariah. It is irrespective of any other belief held anywhere by anyone; it's all about what Hagelin says and thinks. 

&gt;I'm curious what you consider proof. 

Your ignorance of the scientific method, of any of the branches of science being addressed, of basic educational principles, of your tendency to oversimplify complex ideas, etc.. Should I go on, or is this sufficient? 

&gt; Even when someone is mostly wrong, recognizing what virtues they have keeps us from succumbing to the horns effect and similar biases, and also acts as a life-preserver, giving them and people like them reassurance that they can reform and be welcomed back with open arms.

That's more nonsense. John Hagelin has not been kicked out of the club, and his legitimate articles have been cited extensively. No one has black-balled him or his contributions to science. The problem is that he went down the rabbit hole and started focusing on this Unified Consciousness garbage, which is not even scientific, and thus can make no contributions to anything. Of course, if it happened that he actually did make a discovery, people would read what he published. They read the other stuff--the woo he published back in the 80s--so why wouldn't they read it now? 

Again, this is part of the ignorance. You don't even know Hagelin's story. You just assume that because he's a loon nobody listens to him. But if he makes a scientific claim and publishes it, people ar egoing to read it. They're going to tear it apart, but they're going to read it. And it's pretty clear that ridicule hasn't stopped him, since he's still going strong in that quack field of his. 

&gt;At some point, he had to make the transition from particle physicist to politician. Such a huge change almost always takes tremendous courage, and creativity as well, and those are admirable traits.

Sorry, that's a load of horseshit. Transitioning from scientist to politician requires neither bravery nor creativity. All it requires is capital and will.

&gt;I know I might be wrong, and use language which correctly expresses that. 

No you don't. You use language that explicitly removes yourself from criticism. The statement I'm responding to in that quote is a perfect example; you effectively say that if I don't doubt that you're wrong, there's something wrong with me. Not you, but *me*. So my criticism of you becomes a personal failure on my part, rather than an accurate assessment of your position. 

&gt;However, if you wish to convince me that any human is capable of having zero redeeming qualities,

I've never once said that. This is just another strawman. 

&gt;or that it is morally unacceptable for me to grant someone even the slightest shred of respect for those qualities, you'll need to give far more evidence than you've presented here. 

What you continue to fail to see is that he is not doing anything worthy of praise. As I have demonstrated for you, there is no ""Big bad cabal"" of scientists one has to fear when presenting new ideas, nor is there a club that you get booted out of for questioning an established theory. (The latter of which is NOT what Hagelin did, just as a reminder) So ultimately what you're doing is congratulating him for being able to tie his own shoes. Meanwhile, he's advocating potentially dangerous ideas via his mystical pseudoreligious beliefs. Oh, and abusing his perceived authority among laypeople. I mean, if you clicked on a link about a man who beat his child unconscious with a skillet, would you commend him for having the balls to take a different approach to parenting? I mean, after all, you'd be commending his ""questioning of the status quo,"" not the act of skillet-swacking, right? Obviously, any person with a brain would realize how ludicrous it would be to do such a thing, yet that's precisely what you're doing here. 

&gt;Prior probability is against you here.

Cows, chickens and pigs wouldn't have been domesticated if farmers thousands of years ago had found and overall loss in food production.

What they found was that domesticated farm animals basically accumulate calories on auto-pilot, arguing against that is like saying we shouldn't connect a battery to a solar panel because it's more efficient that way, accumulating energy is ineherently inefficient.

Plants don't accumulate much energy and require constant work, while 1 man can handle 70 cows with 1 hour each day, that's around 35,000,000 calories accumulated, a 1/10th of an acre garden will take hours of work each day. 

Plant-based diets, outside of the ecological nightmare created by industrial agriculture, is generally work-intensive. Which is why people in the third world benefit the most from grazing animals. (see cattle charities).

Cattle also feed from plant matter not digestable by humans, furthermore, said plant matter is perennial in nature, while more efficient plants used for food ar annual (maize, wheat, soy).

So while cattle may be inefficient, it's a perennial system of production, while other (more efficient foods) are annual.

I think at the heart of some of these issues we are vilifying people who are themselves also the victim of someone else's anxiety or manipulation. A sadly common scenario for young people.

Full up, if you unambiguously initiate or agree to sex then decide ""ehh, maybe I shouldn't have done this"" in the middle and 1. Say nothing. 2. Make no change in body language, or 3. 'Fake it'  ... How could the other person ever know? Sure, there is now emotional damage to the receiver. Sure, that's bad. But is the 'giver' really guilty of any wrong? In my opinion, absolutely not. Men and women are often guilty of 'playing the part' in sex instead of being honest that they're not really feeling it.

It's not that physics is not important. But if your view was right - or shared by decision makers - then sociology departments would not exist. But that's not the case. So there needs to be decisions to be made how much research money to allocate to sociologists, philosophers, and physicists. Yeah, that is not related to the ""objecticity"" of physics, but it's related to what we *learn* about. 

&gt; The point of physics,biology,chemistry,maths is to give us an objective view of the world basen on evidence. scientific research is contacted in a way so the results are not affected by the beliefs of the scientists that run the research. Also, every scientific paper is peer reviewed many times by independent scientific groups

You don't need to tell me that, but science may have that goal and still have subjective points in it. (Not sure what that^s even supposed to mean). I really recommend you read this article, it's a classic and outlines the potential problems in biology very well 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/4320377?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

For chemistry, I recommend this: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cmdc.201500091 which is a great study into how industry chemists decide which molecules to look into in order to figure out whether they may help in future medication. That's a peculiar problem - because there's no way to know which ones will work out and you need tons of money to look into specific molecules with no guarantee anything comes out of it. What is of interest here is the very subjective argumentation the chemists use to convince their department head that their molecule deserves more funding. 

For physics, I mean I'll gladly grant that it's much less ""subjective"". I don't want to say that we shouldn't be reasonably certain of the outcomes. Not at all. What I'm saying is that your statement that science is completely subjectivity free is wrong.  (And then again,  Quantum Mechanics interpretations are probably not testable , making it a matter of taste rather than empirical testing. To be fair tho, many physisicts don't subscribe to either interpretation)

I don't just say that. i say that as a student of philosophy of science. Pigliucci, who was quoted in the OP, is a biologist-turned-philosopher of biology and really knows what he's talking about.

You then backtracked to 64, good on ya, except you treat that as definitive, then later bring up that there's actually a range of 6 years he could have died in, but you stick to 64 because it suits your case when it could just as well only be 58 years based solely on data you provided. You also treat the year 94 as definitive when data you brought into the debate says it could have been 93, but that doesn't help your case does it. That puts us based solely on data you provided at a range of 57 and 64 years assuming that he wrote the book within the year it was published, a stretch even with modern keyboards.

Depending on account, Jesus died somewhere between AD 30 and AD 36. If you are not aware, 30 (death) + 64 (my claim) = 94 (year of publication).

[],Kalevala7mm,,,[],,,,text,t2_4o9ftoe6,False,[],"Listen. I’m going to try to explain this so that you can understand it.

You cannot control an entire country and its people with tanks, jets, battleships and drones or any of these things that you so stupidly believe trumps citizen ownership of firearms.

A fighter jet, tank, drone, battleship or whatever cannot stand on street corners and enforce “no assembly” edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3AM and search your house for contraband.

None of these things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation. Those weapons are for decimating, flattening and glassing large areas and many people at once, and for fighting other state militaries. The government does not want to kill all of its people and blow up its own infrastructure. These are the very things they need to be tyrannical assholes in the first place. If they decided to turn everything outside of Washington D.C. into glowing green glass they would be the absolute rulers of a big, worthless, radioactive pile of shit - with no workers to tax and no population to recruit more military from.

Police, humans, are needed to maintain a police state, boots on the ground. And no matter how many police you have on the ground they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians which is why in a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while the people have nothing but their limp dicks.

BUT! When every random pedestrian could have a Glock in their waistband and every random homeowner an AR-15 all of that goes out the fucking window because now the police are outnumbered and face the reality of bullets coming back at them.

If you want living examples of this look at every insurgency that the U.S. military has tried to destroy.

I agree. That is a problem, regardless of what size, that should be addressed. I know that there were 16,254 firearms reported stolen (meaning reports were filed). Obviously that also means there were probably more that weren't reported stolen and that is a concern. Though it must also be shown that there's well over 1/3 of the United States with a firearm so the number, again I'm not diminishing it at all, is substantially low.

&gt; Witch-hunts after gun owners is the last thing I want. But I do think people who have a collection of automatics and shotguns that they don’t have the proper respect for should be held responsible for any illegal actions taken with them. 

As someone who served in the military and know friends, both military and non-military, who have substantial collections (in this case 4+), none of them have a disrespect for any of them. They are all locked up, same with ammo, cleaning supplies, etc. Again, I understand there are some bad apples out there, but I think most of the people are well disciplined in what they're doing. 

One of the concerns in your wording is the use of automatic. The word is getting thrown around a lot, and not in the proper context. If the concern is something like an AR-15, that is a semi-automatic firearm that can only fire one round at a time. It can't legally fire more than that with one trigger pull. If you are talking about fully-automatic (i.e. machine guns, M4, etc.) those require a background check that run several thousand dollars at minimum and have an ungodly low success rate of obtaining a license to own one.

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest that you take a look at the ATF Form 4473 and see if it's suitable for what we have in place, or if it should be altered. I just think that any conversations that are had should be keeping in mind that the vast majority of gun owners are doing the right thing on a consistent basis and shouldn't be punished for the actions of the few.

For shooting sports (you didn't consider them to be a sporting goods). Does a sport have to take place at a ""practical, real world place"" (whatever that means). 

Also, I'd argue that sharpening marksmanship skills in a controlled environment like a shooting range is practical. 

&gt; and for killing people ...

Self/home defense doesn't even automatically mean shooting someone (let alone killing them). The purpose is merely to stop/dissuade a serious threat. The vast majority of cases of self defense with a firearm don't even require a shot to be fired (most attacker/intruders simply fee when a gun is pointed at them). For those who don't (those who are looking for a fight/don't care and pose a truly serious risk to your wellbeing), a gun, especially a semi-auto rifle like an AR-15, is the most effective tool to defend against them.

I'm not because they aren't a large rifle. They're relatively short, lightweight, and very manageable. Smaller, intermediate caliber rifles like these were designed for use inside buildings where something like a full sized rifle is unwieldy. 


&gt;yeah if you live in a castle. shotguns and handguns are a clear choice for close range combat. 

There are many clear advantages to AR-15s and other semi-auto rifles over handguns and shotguns aincluding stopping power, capacity, the type of ammunition commonly used (.223/5.56 won't go through anywhere near as many walls as a shotgun slug/buckshot), etc. There are many good reasons why people choose an AR-15 or other semi-auto rifle for home defense. 


&gt;ARs are good for jerking off to, as we see here.

Are you a child? All I'm trying to explain is why people like/have ARs and other semi-auto rifles. I might as well turn it around and say ""hur dur, ARs are good for jerking off against as we see here"".

I'd also like to say that if you get cramps often, try eating more bananas. Might be a symptom of potassium deficiency. Overall fruits are a healthy option, but I wouldn't consider it a quick-and-easy path to a healthy diet.        
You can also chase texture and acquired tastes, since it's super easy to learn to enjoy a whole lot of different vegetables on their own. Snacking on carrots and other veggies is obviously great for your health, and celery is amazing if you're doing a fast. Getting into teas isn't too bad of an idea either.         
Sugar-free gum is also a good idea, particularly xylitol-sweetened gum. It's good for your teeth, although you need regular use (3-5 times daily and it needs to be the first ingredient listed, according to the California Dental Association). 




As for a general diet, I would recommend changing up your *sources* of nutrition. For example, protein from fish and nuts are healthier than beef and pork. It's also much easier and better to *cut out the bad* than to attempt to pile up ""good"" on top. Make a one-time choice to not buy a bag of chips or a can of soda each day, try to remind yourself to grab a glass of water, or swap an unhealthy item out of your meal for an apple or banana.

In my imaginary world... id like to be able to either take a series of photos or videos of all the rooms in your house, furniture, belongings, and just everything. Then AI should consider logical ways to organize everything. 

It would also use data from a variety of sources to predict values of belongings. Then, if you needed to raise cash you could do a sort like a video game based on values or frequency of use to know what you could sell. It might also recommend decluttering certain areas based on low space value.

This program would have an option to apply priceless tags to anything you just arent ever interested in disposing of. It would be AR based and learn over time just from uploading to a map. 

Any time you searched for something to buy, it would tell you if you already own said item, or the closest alternatives. Let's say you needed to purchase a box of nails for a project, but the AR system would know you already own a box of similar screws. If that was inadequate, you could then purchase exactly what you need.

I feel this would reduce waste in a household. You could use it to monitor potential theft. I know almost everybody is strongly opposed to this, but I think it could be useful if there was some way to specify when and where was monitored. 

Maybe individual cameras be placed inside of drawers or containers to monitor just those specific locations. I also think this could be way more useful especially for inventory management at storage facilities. 

The idea would be you wouldn't have to manually take note of every thing you use or have.

[],AcceptableDocument4,,,[],,,,text,t2_2xiottjq,False,,"However, many laws have had the effect of reducing the numbers of certain guns and accessories in circulation. For instance, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 seemed to do a pretty good job of reducing the quantities of machine guns in circulation. Such is evident in how high their prices have climbed since the sale of new ones was banned in 1986, with pre-ban machine guns typically selling for between $20,000 and $30,000. 

At the same time, the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 -- which banned the sale of new magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds, among other things -- similarly caused the supply of pre-ban magazines to go down, which subsequently caused their prices to go up. 

Just before the 1994 ban expired, the price of a pre-ban 30-round magazine for an AR-15 or AK-pattern rifle was almost $100, and the prices of many handgun magazines that held more than 10 rounds were *over* $100. 

It actually tends to work like that. When you stop adding new ones to circulation, the supply starts to go down, and the price starts to go up. Historically, it has actually been shown to be *that simple*.

For another example -- even though it's not related to laws -- the price of a Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver has roughly quadrupled since Colt stopped making them in 2005. They've gone from about $600 for a new one back then to about $2400 (or quite a lot more than that) for a secondhand one today, and their prices will keep climbing for the foreseeable future.

You called them ""trained professionals"", and they are.  But that training, in part, makes them paranoid about their own safety, and hyperfocused on controlling every situation.  The result is often seen in controversial police shootings.  A trained professional police officer perceives some danger (which sometimes doesn't even exist), begins to fear for their safety, barks some commands (sometimes contradictory), and when an untrained, frightened, civilian doesn't comply perfectly in a very compressed period of time (mere seconds), the trained professional police officer shoots them.  Later, the police officer testifies that they were afraid for their safety, and followed their training, and are cleared of wrongdoing.

GP's argument seems to rest on the notion that your average Joe mostly keeps his AR at home, for defense of same.  While Johnny Law keeps his in his cruiser, while he's out actively looking for trouble, trained to do whatever it takes to make it home for dinner, but also trained to never retreat because he must stay in absolute control during any interaction.

In other words, police are well-trained, but their training tends to focus more on good outcomes for police, and not so much the population they're policing.  The average citizen, in contrast, is an order of magnitude more likely to mind his own business and not start any trouble with his weapon.

&gt;How do you know?

Because the two firearms pictured, aside from the handgun, that could take a magazine California labels as ""high capacity"" looks to be an AR-15 and an AK-47. The AK-47 and it's variants have had a 30 round magazine as standard for decades. The AR-15 is commonly sold using magazines that fit NATO's draft STANAG regarding magazines which defines their standardization as being either 20 or 30 rounds. 

&gt;Not according to some classifications it seems

Yes according to the arbitrary and capricious decision of anti-gun lawmakers in California they have said that they completely redefine the standard according to how they want to be, despite what almost every other state in the country says.

&gt;Is it? Who says?

Can you provide any data to show any impact that they have had, other than greatly inconveniencing other law abiding citizens? Because from where I'm sitting it's a stupid law since it doesn't actually do anything to actual criminals and instead impacts only law abiding citizens.

&gt;Again, it is not an error. It is entirely correct - but in your completely biased opinion you have determined this is ""an error"". As if you are stating a fact.

It's funny, because in your completely biased opinion you have determined this ""is entirely correct."" As if you are stating a fact. Pot meet kettle.

&gt;Also, you have no idea whether the magazines were 30 or 60 rounds, you just made a ton of assumptions, applied your own opinion as fact and correct someone who didnt need correcting.

Considering cops would love to show off big scary drum magazines to show how they are taking these dangerous things off the streets, and the fact that the weapons taken from him by police are pictured in the article, it's a pretty safe inference that they are in fact standard capacity as defined by almost everyone except California. And it's also funny to see you making assumptions, and applying your own opinion as fact and trying to correct someone who doesn't need correcting. Once again, pot meet kettle.

&gt;  Indeed, the feeble and suffering king, the son of Leonora, who hated the Jews so deeply that she even refused to accept their money, showed no feelings of friendship toward them. Though on account of the taxes of which he was thereby deprived he regretted that many Jews had left the country and settled in [Málaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1laga), [Almería](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almer%C3%ADa), and [Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada), where they were well treated by the Moors 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In spite of the restrictions placed upon the Jews as *dhimmis*, life under Muslim rule was one of great opportunity in comparison to that under prior Catholic Visigoths, as testified by the influx of Jews from abroad. To Jews throughout the Catholic and Muslim worlds, Iberia was seen as a land of relative tolerance and opportunity. Following initial Arab-Berber victories, and especially with the establishment of [Umayyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad) rule by [Abd-ar-Rahman I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd-ar-Rahman_I) in 755, the native Jewish community was joined by Jews from the rest of Europe, as well as from Arab territories, from Morocco to [Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon) (Assis, p. 12; Sarna, p. 324). Thus the Sephardim found themselves enriched culturally, intellectually, and religiously by the commingling of diverse Jewish traditions. Contacts with Middle Eastern communities were strengthened, and it was during this time that the influence of the [Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Iraq) academies of [Sura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sura_(city)) and [Pumbedita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumbedita) was at its greatest

As far as a POTUS campaign goes, yes - you cannot be mentally ill and assume the office - you'd be considered incapable. 

Actually, any Constitutional oath of office may be considered impossible for someone with a mental handicap to fulfill. 

&gt; Did you know that a mentally handicapped person can drive a car in many states?

What states? What mental handicap? 

&gt; More importantly what is the disadvantage of people being required an extra step? Are you bothered by the additional scrutiny of an NFA Title 2 weapon?

You can put a pistol brace on an AR and make it functionally an SBR. You can get a 37mm flare launcher, and you can print your own bump stock/full-auto fire control group.

The NFA is useless.

&gt; how do/did you feel about the bullet button?

They were silly - it's far easier to have an AR lower a regular mag release, and a .22LR upper for it - you can slap on the 556 lower whenever you need to. If you still want to practice shooting your 556 upper at a public range, you can use an SCR lower, or a bullet-buttoned lower. 

&gt; Or large capacity magazines?

Standard capacity magazines? You can 3d print one for a dollar in material cost, and make the springs with a 3d printed jig and piano wire.

They're a boogeyman, that you can now make at home with a cheap 3d printer.

Look up the Menendez mag.

A towing company can trailer it to you, do find me a gun store that offers home delivery.

You can inherit and frankly this is how I came to possess a few of my firearms. However one might assume that if you are inheriting firearms you might have already been trained on how to use them, perhaps even by the person that left them to you.

Similarly I implore you to locate a person that built a gun that somehow also knows nothing about gun safety or how they work. 

Have both been done? Almost certainly, but a quite a bit of knowledge has to change hands to achieve either. Be it online forums or direct instruction, both of which will allow you to learn more about what you are dealing with to understand how it works and what inherit dangers are present. 

You are entitled to your opinion in the same way I am entitled to mine, it is a discussion to be had. 

Earlier in the thread I gave a recount of a friend of mine that is now quite competent with firearms but acquired one legally having never fired a gun, never really researched it much and owned one by the time I was able to spend some time giving him lessons on shooting. 

Also yes, I have done 80%'s a Polymer80 Glock and an AR 80% lower that didn't go as planned. (Pin misalignment lead to the hammer not landing clean) 

My prior knowledge of firearms facilitated that, and I 100% believe that most curious adolescents could manage the build of either. 

Consider the following:

How long would I stand in a room with a monkey and a loaded firearm? 
(My answer is zero time)

How long would I stand in a room with a monkey and a magazine, a handful of rounds and a gun? 
(Probably until I saw the monkey get a round in the mag.)

How long would I stand in a room with a monkey and all the tools and parts to put together an 80% build, probably the rest of my life. 


Things I hadn't considered previously, ""How long would I stand on a street with a monkey with a running car?"" Continue as you will.

There are good arguments on either side of this debate, I don't have a made up mind but my own experiences make me consider how things might be.

I ask you one question though since you are in defense apparently. 

How would you feel if your upstairs neighbor who for this case we will say is mentally handicapped could go buy Semtex at Walmart the same way you can buy a shotgun or hunting rifle + ammo? 

Scratch mentally handicapped, lets say anarchist, antifa member, monkey, insert some other group you don't think is responsible enough to handle explosives. Explosives are arm's after all, every round you own is an explosive. Why do we require permits and licensing for explosives? 

How would one justify the inability to buy C4 or Semtex but the ability to buy guns an ammo? Should we all be able to just go buy some C4 and detcord?

[],eruffini,,,[],,,,text,t2_fxjdz,False,,"&gt; You buy guns because others have guns. Others buy guns because you have guns. This is a cycle that can't continue forever. 

No? I buy guns because I like them. I buy guns because they are interesting. I'll even collect older guns because they are valuable pieces of history. What other people do does not influence my decision to have a firearm.

&gt; Either it ends in conflict or, hopefully, people see sense and disarm step by step. You don't need to run around yelling what new iron you bought, people are still very aware that generally people are arming themselves. That's not my logic, that's literally what Americans are giving as reasons when asked why they buy guns.

People buy guns for a lot of reasons. If you're referring to self-defense, then that's just one reason among many - and even if someone buys it for self-defense, it is not because other people have guns. You can be violently attacked with hands and feet.

Why do we have to disarm the populace? There are 450 to 600 million legal firearms in circulation in the United States according to revised current estimates. We have no idea how many more are in circulation that are not accounted for. However, it doesn't change the fact that less than a fraction of a percent of all firearms in the United States are responsible for a small number of homicides. 

Homicide through the use of rifles (AR-15's, etc.) count for less than 500 per year, out of a population of 327 million people. Yet we continue to have people trying to ban/remove semi-automatic rifles. Where is the danger here?

&gt; If the guns are for defense, how come countries without mass gun ownership don't have higher massively higher crime rates? If anything, other industrialized nations have same or lower crime rates. So the constant arms race isn't making anyone safer, it just adds more and more weapons to the risk pool. 

It's certainly not a gun problem. Guns don't cause crime. 

Consider that many countries have a homogeneous population demographic where there is a significant dominant culture/ethnicity, compared to how mixed the United States is, and the social safety nets that many Western countries have...

The reason we have higher violent crime rates is because of socioeconomic issues within our country - specifically poverty, the issues caused by the ""War on Drugs"", and lack of basic social services. 

&gt; I'm not saying throw away all your guns this instant. But disarm step by step, perhaps to a more sensible minimum.

What's a ""sensible minimum""? Consider this. If I were to engage in various gun-related hobbies or activities, it is completely plausible to have a collection that looks like this:

* Shotgun (deer and/or large game)
* Shotgun (waterfowl/bird)
* Shotgun (3-gun competition and/or skeet and clay competition)
* Bolt-Action Rifle (deer and/or large game)
* Bolt-Action Rifle (long distance/marksmanship competition)
* Semi-Automatic Rifle (varmint hunting)
* Semi-Automatic Rifle (3-gun competition)
* Semi-Automatic Rifle (pistol caliber carbine competition)
* Semi-Automatic Rifle (home defense)
* Pistol (3-gun competition)
* Pistol (IPSC competition)
* Pistol (home defense)
* Pistol (concealed carry)

Not to mention that there are tons of different classes of competition that have requirements on configuration, caliber, etc. that would dictate ownership of more than one of each. So I posit the question below:

[],Saik0Shinigami,,,[],,,,text,t2_7y1k8,False,,"&gt;Claim: “Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.”

&gt;This is misleading. Jews were prohibited from owning guns and disarmed. Overall, however, gun control laws passed by the Nazis in 1938 actually loosened firearms restrictions that had been in force since the end of World War I.

&gt;Gun ownership was banned outright for all German citizens in 1919. A 1928 revision of the law lifted the ban, while still requiring individuals to obtain permits to own, sell, carry, or manufacture firearms. According to Stephen Halbrook, author of Gun Control in the Third Reich: Disarming the Jews and ‘Enemies of the State’ (Independence Institute, 2013), the Nazis used the extant law when they came to power in 1933 to revoke the permits of communists, Jews, and other “undesirables,” and disarm them. The first gun law actually enacted under Nazi rule, the German Weapons Act of 1938, eased some of the permit requirements (those on rifles and ammunition, though not on handguns), and lowered the legal age for the possession of firearms, but also forbade Jews, specifically, from manufacturing or selling arms.

&gt;The Regulations Against Jews’ Possession of Weapons, enacted later that year, prohibited Jews from possessing or carrying any kind of weapon at all.

&gt;So, while the Nazis ultimately favored loosening gun restrictions on the German population as a whole, the disarmament of Jews and other targeted minority populations was an essential feature of Hitler’s genocidal program, which included the murder of six million Jews (and millions of others deemed unworthy to live under the Third Reich) between 1938 and the end of World War II.

[],LimbsLostInMist,,,[],,,,text,t2_3267eixr,False,[],"Yeah, I've already read that paper - not only do paediatricians score  higher than surgeons - surgeons don't score that much higher than psychiatrists. 

What they're finding is stress immunity, not psychopathy as a disorder:

&gt; This is the first study to demonstrate that stress immunity is the overriding personality trait of doctors. The mean PPI–SF score of 131 for our cohort of consultants was higher than the mean for the general population (119).

...

&gt;  Our study does demonstrate that stress immunity is a personality trait that is over-represented among doctors, with higher PPI–SF scores found in surgeons, paediatricians and those working in teaching hospitals

And:

&gt; The PPI–SF only confers an actual diagnosis of psychopathic personality when an individual scores highly across all of the subdivisions. The concept of psychopathy is obviously considerably more complex than a linear scale of increasing psychopathic tendency with increasing numerical score. The results and conclusions in this paper should be interpreted with this in mind.

And, then there's the self-selection bias issue regarding individuals who may be overexposed to stress on the job, even within the medical field as opposed to non-responsive peers:

&gt; Our selection criteria could have intro-duced bias as consultants were emailed the questionnaire and only those willing to participate completed the online survey. The response rate of 41% in our population compares favourably with the physician response rates of 14–71% published in the literature. Questionnaires are prone to selection bias; people who were curious or who had insight into the day-to-day stresses of the job may have been more curious to find out their results

English never has, and being the global lingual Franca *now*, there are so many variant types it would be impossible to reach consensus *now* on what should be the standard phonology *now* reflected in the orthography *now*. 

In spanish the letter “a” represents a single vowel sound. Consistent by dialect.

In English the letter “a” represents at least 5 or 6 different phonemes, that aren’t consistent at all even in the same dialect, let alone from dialect to dialect. Sometimes the exact same phonemes are represented by other vowels entirely.

So, in my dialect “bath” is pronounced like “barth” But not rhotic. Let’s decree that the letter “a” always represents that single sound “ar”. 

That now means that face (feice) is pronounced farce and hat is pronounced hart unless we invent two new letters to represent (ei) and (æ). 

But the a in bath is pronounced like the a in hat (æ) by General American speakers. But then the a in father is pronounced like my a in bath. In General American that exact same sound is used for the “ou “in the word “thought”, but in my dialect thought is pronounced like thort. But ou doesn’t sounds like “or” in house.

[],goatharper,,,[],,,,text,t2_1yi34xqe,False,[],"Diversity, of course, means ""many differnt things."" Instead of explaining diversity, let's look at the opposite of diversity, a corn field, for example.

A farmer wants to grow corn. He plows the field, maybe sprays weed kliler to get rid of all the unwanted plants, then plants corn. He sprays insecticide to klil bugs that eat his corn. He makes sure nothing lives in that field but corn. Anything else is eating his corn or using his fertilizer at the expense of his corn. The is called monoculture, and is the opposite of biodiversity.

So imagine the farmer dies. Nobody sprays for weeds, nobodt sprays for bugs, nobody plants corn. The feld will sprout all sorts of things, and the bugs and the birds and the mice and all sorts of plants and animals will move in. Maybe foxes will come to eat the mice, and so on. ow you have biodiversity, a balanced system that regulates itself.

One reason biologists like biodiversity is because it means that there ar emany different plants and animals and if something happens to kill off all the mice, or buttercups other animals and plants are there to fill their place in the system. If a corn field suddenly dies, there's nothing there to take the place of the corn right away. Eventually things will move in, but what happens when the whole world is one single species, and there are no places full of many types of plants and animals?

That may sound far-fetched, but it happened in Ireland in the 1800s. They were growing potatoes everywhere, and when the potato crop failed, people starved. Many emigrated to America, which is why there are lots of people of Irish descent in the US today. 

Another example is the Atlantic cod. People fished out all the cod, and something took its place. Jellyfish. Now the cod can't come back because the jellyfish are there and aren't going anywhere. 

Another aspect of biodiversity is genetic, and the main one you will hear about. Many different types of plants ad animals means many different types of DNA. Having lots of different DNA around ensures that even a catastrophe will not wipe out all life.

You drop all the zeroes when you go to scientific notation because they are not significant. In fact, that;s a big advantage of scientific notation, you only have significant digits and no extra non-significant zeroes lying around.

""Significant"" in this context is actually defined as ""meaningful."" 

Say I tell you it's about 200 miles to grandma's house. Well, all you really know is that it's at least 150 and less than 250, if you consider the number of significant digits I gave you is just one.

With impacts, it's not the *size* of what hits you, but the *speed* that it hits you... but if what hits you has size *and* speed, you're fucked.

Some fathomable examples: A .223 bullet (the round used in the AR-15) is not very big at all. That measurement is its diameter, and that is in inches. Less than 1/4 of an inch in diameter. The mass of a .223 FMJ round is around 3.6 grams. To put that number into some sense of perspective, it takes about 453.5 grams to make a pound. An average bowling ball is about 10 pounds, or 4535 grams, and doing some quick math you'd need about 1,200 .223 bullets to get to the same weight.

Now, if someone throws a bowling ball at you, it is going to hurt, but you'll probably survive. This is because the speed someone can throw a bowling ball is pretty limited; most bowlers rolling a bowling ball will be releasing at about 20 mph, or almost 30 feet per second.

A .223 round has a muzzle velocity of 3,240 feet per second.

The thing is that how much damage something does when it impacts is related to its kinetic energy, and kinetic energy = 1/2(mass * velocity^2 ) so while increasing the mass increases energy linearly, increasing velocity increases energy exponentially.

Now back to asteroids: Asteroids are really really really really really big hunks of rock. They have a mass somewhere in the range of 10^15 kilograms, or 10^18 grams, at least for the ones big enough to cause extinction events.

Speeds are a bit variable, but remember our bullet flying at 3,240 feet per second? Well, NASA uses meters per second, so let's do a quick conversion: about 987.5 meters per second for a 3.6 gram projectile; that's enough to kill a person.

Our asteroid is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 grams, or something in that neighborhood. It is also moving, at the low end, 11,000 m/s, as that is Earth's escape velocity.

More than likely though, it is going to be moving somewhere in the range of 20,000 to 25,000 m/s when it impacts.

So, let's do some kinetic energy calculations: to get the answer in joules mass needs to be in kilograms and speed needs to be in meters per second.

Bullet: 1/2 (.0036 * 987.5 * 987.5) =  1775.5 joules of kinetic energy

Asteroid: 1/2 (1,000,000,000,000,000, * 20,000 * 20,000) ~= 2x10^23 (or 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [or 200 sextillion]) joules of kinetic energy.

A bullet from a .223 hitting the earth will kick up, at best, a small dust cloud by about a foot. That asteroid is going to kick up everything it touches by miles until it slows down (by enough resistance from what it's moving through absorbing its kinetic energy) to a stop.

This is where physics stops being helpful; as others have said, this puts lots of particulate matter into the atmosphere, generally each solid particle being so small that it can be suspended in the air by the force of the wind (just like dirt can be blown up by an updraft to an extent to create a powder of fine dust but a rock stays put, heavier particles eventually settle but the light dusting takes a long time to rejoin with the other tiny particles); these bits of solids collectively absorb and reflect a lot of the sun's rays, which means that plants no longer get light to fuel photosynthesis, and thus die off; this then kills animals who can no longer eat those plants as a food source, which eventually kills predators, and so on and so forth.

In the past, impacts like that haven't managed to kill off *all* life, as far as the fossil records have shown us. They kill off the *majority* of plant life and the *vast majority* of animal life, but a little bit of each adapts to the new environment successfully and lives in small numbers through numerous generations until the dust literally settles, and the sun can nourish the plants again, which allows herbivores to thrive, which then eventually gives rise to predators, and so on, until we have a functioning food chain and ecosystem again.

Needless to say, we really should look into stopping that from happening, at least for our own sake.

You might want to try this over at the firearms sub or the ar15 sub.  

The ar15 guys could give you great info, since a lot of them are into hobby builds for their own rifles.  

Here is a start though.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's start with the AR15.  The AR 15 (usually) is a gas operated, ""direct impingment"" rifle. 

This [picture shows an ar15 and the path the gas travels.](https://system.na1.netsuite.com/core/media/media.nl?id=9238582&amp;c=3901023&amp;h=ac08342557e085831b8c)

The bullet goes down the barrel, and the gas from the exploding gunpowder is behind it, pushing the bullet through the barrel.  

&amp;nbsp;

That place where the red line turns and curve around is a hole called the ""gas port"".  

The gas goes in the gas port, into that tube on top called the ""gas tube"" and goes down the tube, all the way back to the ""bolt carrier group"".  The gas pushes the bolt carrier back, and that is what loads another bullet and cocks it for another shot.  This is what makes it ""semi-automatic"".

&amp;nbsp;

[Just watch this quick illustration to see what all that means.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sjGzvyQcvg)

&amp;nbsp;

You have to control how much gas goes into the gas tube.  Too little gas, and you will not have enough pressure to push the bolt back. The gun ""won't cycle"" i.e., it won't load the next round and fire again.

Too MUCH pressure, and the bolt will come back too hard.  This can wear the gun out faster, and also make the recoil much harder, which makes the gun less accurate and less comfortable to shoot.

&amp;nbsp;

twist rate has to do with how fast the bullet spins.

The inside of the barrel has twisted grooves [(rifling)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iAIbc6Q1-gI/hqdefault.jpg) that make the bullet spin as it flies.  This spinning stabilizes the bullet in flight, so it can go farther with more accuracy.  [(think of it like a football player throwing a football)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZoVVLNDo3g) 

Different bullets come in different weights and shapes.  Based on the weight and shape of the bullet you plan to fire, making the bullet spin faster or slower might be better.  For example, a long heavy bullet tends to need to spin faster to stay stable, so a hunter who plans to shoot deer, would need to use heavier bullets to kill a deer cleanly and humanely, and would pick a barrel for his rifle build that has a faster twist",1568651002,{},f0j4d28,False,t3_d52df5,False,True,t3_d52df5,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/d52df5/eli5_what_are_the_benefits_of_different_barrel/f0j4d28/,1568651013.0,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The state’s name has been spelled several ways throughout history. In Marquette and Joliet’s Journal of 1673, the Indian name is spelled AKANSEA. In LaSalle’s map a few years later, it’s spelled ACANSA. A map based on the journey of La Harpe in 1718-1722 refers to the river as the ARKANSAS and to the Indians as LES AKANSAS. In about 1811, Captain Zebulon Pike, a noted explorer, spelled it ARKANSAW.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas#Etymology_and_pronunciation)

&gt;The name Arkansas was initially applied to the Arkansas River and derives from a French term, Arcansas, the plural term for Quapaws, a Dhegiha Siouan-speaking Native American people who settled in Arkansas around the 13th century. This comes from an Algonquian term, /akansa/, for the Quapaws, and is likely also the root term for Kansas.

The name has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. In 1881, the pronunciation of Arkansas with the final ""s"" being silent was made official by an act of the state legislature after a dispute arose between Arkansas's two U.S. senators as one favored the pronunciation as /ˈɑːrkənsɔː/ AR-kən-saw while the other favored /ɑːrˈkænzəs/ ar-KAN-zəs.",1566884604,{},ey7ies1,False,t3_cvzzj5,False,True,t3_cvzzj5,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/cvzzj5/eli5_why_isnt_arkansas_pronounced_like_kansas/ey7ies1/,1566884606.0,1,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**All** gases will absorb light of various wavelengths, and re-emit that light at various *other* wavelengths, and what specific wavelengths they emit and absorb is dependent on the atoms/molecules of the gas itself.

The trick is that the overwhelming majority of the gas in the atmosphere are just three compounds; molecular oxygen and nitrogen (O2 and N2), and atomic Argon (Ar). Monatomic and diatomic gases generally don't interfere with infrared light that much; it's relatively easy for those wavelengths of light to penetrate the spaces between those gases, so any infrared light generated anywhere in the atmosphere (e.g. when it hits the ground) will tend to be reemitted back into space pretty easily.

However, larger molecules *will* reabsorb that infrared light, meaning it has a harder and harder time of getting back into space. CO2 is actually the *weakest* of the GHGs by a pretty fair margin, but the trick is that because it's pretty easy to create the sheer *volume* of gas being produced is a big problem. Other gases (particularly methane) are worse individually, but they tend not to be emitted in nearly as high levels.

The only combustion emission that generally isn't seen as a problem is water, which will be produced at basically the same rates as CO2. Water vapor actually absorbs a lot more infrared radiation than CO2, but isn't generally considered a GHG because water also naturally condenses out of the atmosphere and falls as rain. Thus, water tends not to build up in the atmosphere, and so any GHG potential of water vapor tends to be pretty limited.",1566408931,{},exl9zl9,False,t3_cte4th,False,True,t3_cte4th,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/cte4th/eli5_how_does_more_co2_cause_the_world_to_heat_up/exl9zl9/,1566408933.0,1,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Usually this gets backed up by referring to Federalist Paper 29 and/or the writings of Thomas Jefferson and claiming that both support wide and unrestricted gun ownership as a safeguard against the government turning against its citizens, as they would be far more capable of rising up if they were armed. Obviously, a lot of this is up for debate, and established Supreme Court precedents simply muddy the waters. They support the notion that certain weapons can be banned, but also that certain weapons (notably handguns) cannot be banned.

There's also the line of argument that ""shall make no law"" means exactly that, and a reason to own the gun is not a requirement. Just as owning a car that can go 200+ MPH has no particular use in a country where the speed limit tops out at 80, and operating such a vehicle at those speeds is exceedingly dangerous to the driver and bystanders, yet is still legal to own and use in a legal manner. 

Terminology is also a problem regarding ""Assault Rifles"" and what is meant by that term. Guns, especially the AR-15, are a collection of components. Things like stocks (what goes into your shoulder), foregrips (where your non-trigger hand goes to stabilize your aim), scopes, barrels, attachment points, and so on. It's why you'll often hear particular guns referred to as ""platforms"". What's considered a ""gun"" in terms of registration is a component called the ""lower receiver"", which is the ""heart"" of the gun where most of the other components attach. It's basically a u-shaped piece of metal with a few holes and some rails welded to it. Using different combinations of components, you can build an AR-15 in hundreds, if not thousands, of ways, from thing that look and shoot like pistols up through what people commonly call an M-16 and beyond. The M-16 is the military version of the AR-15, the primary difference being that the M-16 has a switch that changes it from full-auto (gun fires as long as the trigger is held down until it's empty) to Semi-auto (gun fires once every time the trigger is pulled). The AR-15 could be modified to fit such a switch, but it's very illegal to do so.

[],Zushauque,,,[],,,,text,t2_z216g,False,,"Just a quick comment on the etymology. There is another saying about the origin of the word alcohol coming from al-ḡawl instead.   


Here is a quote from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alcohol#Etymology) on the Etymology:

&gt;Ultimately from an [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic) term which first entered European alchemical jargon, and then entered general use. It reached English in the 1500s via [Old Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Spanish_language) and/or [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French) [*alcohol*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alcohol#Old_French) (modern French [*alcool*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alcool#French)).   
&gt;  
&gt;Since at least the 1600s,[\[1\]](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alcohol#cite_note-1) some authorities have suggested [*اَلْكُحْل*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83%D8%AD%D9%84#Arabic)‎ (al-kuḥl, “[kohl](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kohl)”) as the Arabic etymon; this suggestion is found for example in *Webster's Third New International Dictionary*.   
&gt;  
&gt;Other authorities, including Rachel Hajar, suggest that the ultimate etymon was the classical [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic) term [*اَلْغَوْل*](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D9%84&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)‎ (al-ḡawl) or [*غَوْل*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%BA%D9%88%D9%84#Arabic)‎ (ḡawl, “bad effect, evil result of headache”) (as used in Qur’an verse 37:47 ([Arabic](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/ar:%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA)), which refers to drink in which there is no ""ghawl"").

And the meaning of the world الكُحْل (al-kohl) from [Lane's Lexicon](http://arabiclexicon.hawramani.com/?p=3918#5fd2dc) (a good resource on Arabic):

&gt; عَيْنٌ كَحْلَآءُ An eye that is black, \[or black in the edges of the lids,\] by nature, as though it had كُحْل applied to it. (Mgh.) Not in the TA. \[It seems to have both of these meanings.\] 

The word كُحْل (kohl) here refers to antimony, a material that is put in the eye (or used in eyeliners?).   


The other word mentioned in Wiktionary's etymology entry, غَوْل, seems to me like the more reasonable origin. In [Lane's Lexicon](http://arabiclexicon.hawramani.com/?p=2896&amp;book=50#67ea6e) (again):

&gt;  In the saying in the Kur \[xxxvii. 46\], لَا فِيهَا غَوْلٌ,  \[referring to the wine of Paradise,\] it means The evil result of  headache; because it is said in another place, \[lvi. 19,\] لَا  يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا: (S, O, TA:) or it \[there\] means \[simply\] headache: or intoxication: (K, TA:) thus some expl. it as used in that instance: (TA:) or, as expl. by AO, it there means privation of the intellectual faculties. (S, O, TA.) b2:  See also غُولٌ, latter half. b3: Also Distress, trouble, or molestation: (K, TA:) thus  expl. by some as used in the Kur ubi suprà. (TA.) b4:  And Unfaithfulness; or unfaithful acting. (TA.) b5:  ↓ أَتَى غَوْلًــا غَائِلَةً means He did a cunning, bad, action. (K.) A3:  Also Much earth. (S, O, K.) Hence the phrase غَوْلًــا مِنَ الرَّمْلِ, \[app. meaning A large quantity of sand,\] in a verse of Lebeed. (S, O.) 

The ḡawl definition is also more consistent with the last paragraph about the eastern attitudes.

Background checks - Prior to purchasing a gun law enforcement performs a detailed background check looking for criminal history and history of mental illness. Basically if you are too dangerous to own a gun, you can't buy one.

Permits - Having a permit to own a gun in Canada requires a background check, and a mandatory gun safety course. This is too people the law and help ensure they understand how to use and store their weapons safely.

Most hunting rifles are in larger caliber rounds (common ones include .270, .308, .30-30, .30-06, .45-70). The 5.56 NATO round was designed and adopted by US military forces as an injuring round.

Your “income statement” accounts - like Revenue and COGS - are really just sub accounts _inside_ of Retained Earnings - when all the accounts are added up, your RE is the result.  This is how you reconcile the “balance sheet must balance” with “double entry” bookkeeping.

When you get your $100 in revenue, you’ll credit the RE sub account - Revenue - $100 while debiting your Asset account (cash or AR) $100 to keep things in balance.  Same with COGS - you’ll debit the COGS account and credit inventory by $50 to keep things in balance.  When you add up the $100 in Revenue and the -$50 in COGS, you get $50 in RE, which is now balanced with our Asset accounts (Cash went up by $100 and Inventory went down by $50).

Bels are logarithmic units. If you have one bel, that's 10x more than 0bel. If you have 2 bels, that's 100x more than 0bel, and 10x more than 1bel. Likewise, -1bel is one tenth of 0bel, and one 100th of 1bel, and one 1000th of 2bel.

Decibels have ""deci"", meaning ""one tenth"". So one decibel is one tenth of a bel. Increase something by 10decibels is the same ar increase it by 1 bel.

Rules of thumb like ""doubles every 3 decibels"" are derived from this. Like, 5decibel increase has to be such that if done twice, you get 10decibel increase(10x the original amount). That means 5decibels gives sqrt(10) increase.

My favorite rule of thumb here is that doubling 10 times gives you 1024, while increasing by 10-fold three times gives you 1000. That's pretty close. So 30 decibels has to divide into 10 doublings.

[],Sr_Sabetodo,,,[],,,,text,t2_2yz0htdq,False,,"Hello there! 

I want to start off by apologising for how long this post is; I didn’t want to oversimplify it too much. 

Both MIG (metal inert gas) and TIG (tungsten inert has) are forms of arc welding. TIG may also be referred to as GTAW (gas tungsten arc welding) and MIG as GMAW (has metal arc welding). Typically when I hear arc welding, I think about SMAW (shielded metal arc welding) or stick welding, which is one of the most common welding processes. However, I have also seen FCAW (flux corded arc welding) referred to as arc welding.  All of these processes have a few things in common however; they all use heat generated through electrical resistance and all utilise some form of atmospheric shielding. 

MIG and FCAW work almost the exact same, as both utilise a wire feed mechanise that feeds the consumable wire electrode into the weld pool. However, MIG uses an external shielding gas, which is typically either carbon dioxide (CO2) or argon (Ar), which is dispersed through a nozzle over the weld pool. FCAW, however, doesn’t use an external shielding gas. Instead, it uses a hollow wire which inside contains what’s called flux, which burns and creates a shielding atmosphere for the weld pool. Both of these processes are fairly quick to use and easy to learn. However, they cannot weld aluminium and cannot weld very thick metal. My FCAW machine can only weld up to 3/16” metal, however, I surmise there are other, more powerful machines that can weld thicker materials. 

TIG welding is a little bit different than GMAW, as unlike these two processes, TIG uses a non-consumable electrode that is made out of tungsten and mostly uses Argon as a shielding gas. This makes TIG a very precise process; it can be used to weld needles together. The TIG process is more difficult than GMAW as the welder not only has to direct the arc, but they also have to manually feed in the filler rod by hand into the weld pool. However, as a result of the precision this process has, it will produce the best looking welds out of all of the processes. The most important aspect of TIG is that it can be used to weld aluminium, and to my knowledge is the best method for welding aluminium. This process isn’t very fast to do, and is difficult to learn. 

SMAW was the first arc welding process to be used. SMAW or stick works by having a clamp, which holds a long thick wire, which is why it is called stick welding. This electrode is coated in flux, which makes this process gas free. What the welder does with this process is strike the arc like a match, and pull the electrode across the joint or whatever is being welded. While pulling the electrode, the welder also pushes the electrode down, as it’s consumed during the process. This can made the process difficult to learn, however it is one of the most versatile processes. SMAW can be quick and efficient as its basically a strike and go process. 

Oxy/Acetylene or Oxy-fuel welding is the only process here that doesn’t use electricity. Instead, acetylene and pure oxygen are combined and burnt to produce heat and a protective flame envelope. With this process, the welder also has to feed the filler rod by hand. However, Oxy-fuel is a much slower process since you have to wait for the metal to heat up and melt. This makes this process the slowest out of all of the aforementioned processes. That being said, this is the most portable process since it doesn’t require an electric current. 

I wanted to wait until the end to touch on the actual strength of all of these processes. Assuming you’re making good, correct welds, all of these processes can produce strong welds. This means that the only real limitation will be the thickness of the metal itself. Because of this, i would say that SMAW is probably the strongest process since it can weld the thickest metal out of all of the other processes.",1560670663,{},erbbihy,False,t3_c174d0,False,True,t3_c174d0,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/c174d0/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_ark_mig_tig/erbbihy/,1560670664.0,13,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,1560857529.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think this starts out with someone writing AI that involves a simple algorithm that is densely packed with if and else statements - which is what some simple AIs actually are, e.g. Final Fantasy's turn-based AIs. And then the person thinks, maybe all AI is this simple! What a joke AI is! But this is not a good description of lots of AI, like machine learning or playing chess.

Then when people think ""well, if and else statements are in all code"", this is sometimes extended to ""all programming is just if and else statements"". Is it?

No. If and else statements are high level control flow constructs. They are important, but if you want to get down to it, programming is about writing a sequence of instructions. Control flow constructs like if and else are important in high level source code, but that's all you can say.

It wasn't bad per say, but i dont really have much glowing good things to say about it either.  IMHO KH3 took all the good from KH2 and improved on it, then took all the bad and made some of the best parts of 3. The gummy ship sections i hated before was some if my favorite parts in 3. They made it an open world you can roam and figh battles, hunt for rare items, and navigate complex structures while fighting you way through. 

They gave each keyblade unique powers,  from abilities, to forms, to summons. It was more than just more stats and a different cosmetic.  They incorporated those abilities along with ride theme battle abilities into the flow of combat flawlessly.  It never felt cluttered or choppy like i was afraid it would before playing it.

You got to keep all 3 party members on worlds and the individual world characters came along as back up, rather than having to abandon a core member and having level and gear difference.  They each brought unique battle commands. 

The story blew 2 out of the water, and they handled the lore problems well enough. 

The difficult didnt widely fluctuate like 2 did at times.  

The new graphics were meh at first, but they put them to full use later on and overall the game was beautiful graphics wise.

The theme song was actually a really good EDM remix done by skrillex and the girl who normally does the songs. Its not as memorable as simple and clean, but its close.

So, yeah. My only complaint was the stupid way they hamfisted social media and technology into the story,  and i felt like they kind of turned riku and sora into bland whiny androgynous final fantasy characters with spiky hair, or every FF protagonist ever. Those are really my only complaints and they are vastly overshadowed by what they did right.  Its a A+ in my book.  The ammount of content is insane and its easy to not realize.  Ive yet to play through and not find something new yet.

Well, the atoms hit [the walls of their container] harder because they are moving faster, and in addition they hit more often, so the pressure increases. You see how simple the ideas of atomic theory are. 

If we take this and don‘t fix the density, but rather the pressure (gas in a room will always have very low pressure differences between different areas), then we can see that the density will decrease.
