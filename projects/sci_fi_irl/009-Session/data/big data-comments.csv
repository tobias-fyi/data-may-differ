Ignore the source of this graph for a second, and just follow me down a discussion.  [The US Temperature](http://www.coyoteblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/us-temperature-trend.gif) over the last 100 years or so has indeed risen in average.  That's the maximum temperture minus the minimum temperature has gone up. But! the average has gone up because the minimum has risen a lot more than the maximum has changed.  The maximum temperatures hasn't actually changed much at all.

Stated another way, it's not getting hotter, but the nights aren't getting quite as cold.  The highs for the years of 1930 - 1940 are higher, on average, than any time after the year 2000.  But, our AVERAGE has climbed, because the minimums are higher now than they were in the 1930s.  Not by much, but by a little.  

Of course, that's just the US, but we have really good records for the US.  And!  I personally believe that the data you're seeing in this (taken from official records) has been adjusted too much and is actually telling us that we've ""warmed"" more than we have.  

So, we are warming, on average.  But is the warming dangerous? Not enough to cause me to panic, certainly. 

To add to this, the claim of the scientists is that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet.  This means that the biggest effect is up in the Arctic, not here where I live. Instead of being 1° hotter than the 1800s, where I live, the consequences are that I'm not hotter, at all, and nights are, oh, half a degree warmer than they would have been. Not as cold.  In summer, half a degree of ""not as cool"" is not a big deal, and in the winter, half a degree of ""not as fucking cold"" is welcome.

Oh, and the climate scientists do NOT claim that 100% of the warming is due to additional CO2 in the atmosphere. Some of it is due to changes to the reflectivity of the planet, urban heat island effect, land-use changes, ocean cycles, solar effects, or something else.  So, maybe nights are only a third of a degree less cold due to climate change from additional CO2.

The reality on the ground (measured from data on weather balloons and satellite images) is either on the low-end of predictions, or completely unpredictable.

I'm oversimplifying, but consider this: One day you tell me that doomsday is coming, and that I should pay your a crap-ton of money to prevent it. I go outside, see that everything is fine and ask how you came to this conclusion? You tell me that you've looked at historical data, and are now making a prediction based on your model. I review your model a few years later and see that your prediction was way off, call your out on it, and your excuse is that ""well there's a trend"".

&gt;Several of these research findings were published subsequent to the 2013 release of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and thus were not included in that Assessment. Others were considered in the IPCC AR5, and still others were ignored. And while the IPCC AR5 did reflect some influence on these new low ECS estimates—by expanding its “likely” range of ECS estimates downward to include 1.5°C (the low end was 2.0°C in the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report) and omitting a “best estimate” value (which had previously been given as 3.0°C in the 2007 report)—it still doggedly held on to its high end “likely” estimate of 4.5°C. This was a disservice to the latest science, but was a necessary step to preserve the IPCC’s reliance on climate projections made by models with an ECS averaging 3.2°C and ranging from 2.1°C to 4.7°C—the same models recently evaluated by Christy and in our AGU presentation. Had the IPCC fully embraced an ECS near 2.0°C—that which the recent literature suggests—it would have had to throw out much of the rest of the report.

I'm not sure how comment will be useful to you are the work is done. In brief:

Feeding the Beast

Agricultural productivity comes at the price of land consolidation. That in turn follows and leads urbanisation. Most governments are chiefly concerned by urban poverty (because it has political consequences) and so cheap food is mandated, often exporting poverty to the countryside. An integrated and thoughtful approach can avoid this. Water is used at about 3% efficiency in peasant agriculture and, notably in Pakistan, huge improvements are possible with existing technology. There's a big role for GMOs, which India has largely banned.

The Next Big Economy

I think that you miss the geopolitical importance of the fast-approaching rebalancing of economic weight. Asia will field more skilled workers than the old rich world has citizens. Twice as many, in fact. You also miss the political values of the emerging middle classes, which are considerably to the Right of eg European consensus, and which will generate a very different world. India stands out as organically democratic, but how long that will suvive the death fo deference is anyone's guess.

The Mega-Sprawl Approaches

The future is urbanised, and is so far very poorly managed. India has one failure mode, China has experienced another. The real issue, though, is that cities are the centre of added value and they will deal with each other far more than their respective national hinterlands. Their imperatives will come from this direction, and national governments will have little by way of choice - save for semi-suicidal options - when confronted with this. 

The 4th Industrial Proletariat

See above, middle class values. But I think you have swallowed the cool-aid in respect of ""data is the new oil"". Save in entertainment, data are simply the means to cut costs and avoid friction. However, efficiency produces churning and new demands on workers, both of which the least educated cannot meet. The low skilled have generally experienced income growth that is either stagnant or lagging; and many are hard-pressed to add as much value as it costs to live. The West patched this up with welfare but that is not an option for the massively populous nations and those with slow growth. Anything from repressed instability to economic apartheid are the only alternatives that do not involve disruption for countries that do not upgrade their human capital both continually and very substantially. 

The Dogs of War

Wars cannot capture modern economies and hope to harvest their output but they can capture workers and corn fields. These ancient war aims are still feasible in the emerging economies. Generally, economic acquisitions are easier to manage than physical capture, as with China in Africa. Equally, damaging another nation's standing by destabilising its institutions or weakening its economy are standard tools. Arguably, previous Indian foreign policy was aimed at precisely this. It is, though, extremely dangerous in the world of economic exclusion that is foreseeable for the region: a nation starts populist movements in one country and finds them rebounding onto it: Taliban, in a word, Pakistan. This dangerous route must appear extremely attractive to China.

Apart from the pitfalls of capital redistribution comes the problem of who is implementing it and how much corruption needs to be baked into that policy. We know there will be some as anything that moves around assets like that will be gamed significantly, and ironically the people with the most assets would most likely be exempt from any redistribution (defeating the purpose of it) because as the bailouts of the banks showed us, both parties are committed to ""Too big to fail""

&gt;Where do you plan to place the line?

We've managed to compromise on different taxes for products, wages, property etc. I think we could come up with a fair system which rewards inventions based on usefulness and other criteria, people/companies don't need to make hundreds of billions of dollars in profit on every product. It should be fairly high, but still limited so that a company can't just milk this 1 important invention at the expense of the consumer that might depend on it.

&gt;When you can monopolize something as a company, you set the price tag, but when you sell a licence, you are free to sell it to as many people as you want, providing that the contract is not exclusive.

Or, every invention, after the year/profit limit has expired, gets 100% free to use and any invention dependent on that one gets licensed in the same way and so on, like how the open source-community works (some licenses).
Then everyone can produce old inventions and sell them at the price they actually cost to manufacture.

&gt;Some content, like the human DNA, have obvious militaristic and terroristic applications that are extremely dangerous for humanity.

I don't really understand what you mean by this? Are you talking about gene therapy? If so, what are you afraid they're gonna do? If they're  sophisticated enough to be able to modify CRISPR, they're gonna figure out the same things that we are, it doesn't matter if we make it free or not, so we might as well.

&gt;At the same time, I'm not up to pay I+D for companies with my taxes. If they want to produce an item, pay back the research cost.

That's why patents should be limited, so after the company that invented it have made a decent enough profit on it, the public gets it back, if it was publicly funded. I'd rather take it even further and go full socialism, but a well regulated capitalism is better than what we have now.

&gt;Also both are locally, nationally at best, when research is globally.

Yeah, but the people in charge want to stay in charge, so they will do what the voters appreciate the most, which is spending money locally and not globally. This is one of democracy's biggest flaws.

To make the argument short: They are the only barrier that avoids a big company to simply steal your idea and start producing your invention under their brand for half the price that you can.

&gt; until you've made a ""big enough"" profit of something like 150%

Where do you plan to place the line? Remember that, as opposed to sport progams, these copyrights revert on themselves and in general progress of a research field.

&gt; sounds more like you're proposing jacking up the prices on insulin as a way for universities to make money.

Nowhere in my comment. That is what happens when my first point in this comment becomes true. When you can monopolize something as a company, you set the price tag, but when you sell a licence, you are free to sell it to as many people as you want, providing that the contract is not exclusive.

&gt; Universities should be publicly funded

They are in most countries of the world. USA is just a big anomaly that waste talent by placing money barriers to all.

&gt; All research should be made freely available to anyone

I disagree. Some content, like the human DNA, have obvious militaristic and terroristic applications that are extremely dangerous for humanity.

At the same time, I'm not up to pay I+D for companies with my taxes. If they want to produce an item, pay back the research cost.

&gt; But building a new stadium for a sport that most Americans love also serves the purpose of being something that people can see and use.

Never said otherwise. I said it is more expensive and has less profit. Also both are locally, nationally at best, when research is globally.

&gt; While I find it fascinating to know how different crops grow in microgravity not everyone does

Not all people like domestic violence laws, that doesn't mean that they aren't 100% neccessary. (Maybe too much black-or-white example here, sorry, but was best I could think)

&gt; they also want to see something happen for the taxes they pay.

Well, in the USA situation is pretty much military and bureaucracy. That accounts for the vast majority of their taxes, and are clearly less important than education.

&gt; A balance between sports and science is very possible to achieve

Not when one has a public image. Sports win cause they are easy to show, while science is not. Nobody wants to see a super computer working, or a qbits procesing data, but a lot of people dream of getting out of poverty by becoming athletes, which is pretty much the lie that is sport-fiction sells.

&gt; we need entertainment in out lives too

Yup, but can't be more pricey than saving our lifes or progressing as society, which is the current situation.

&gt; Look up how much the US pays for health care per capita and then consider that many countries offer free health care.

That's because they are still addapting to the regulated market that guarantee that a fair price is paid for medicines and treatments, instead of the current ""pay or die"" situation that is USA health care system.

&gt; Now, in a paper posted this week on the scientific preprint site arxiv.org, Johnson and his team report that they’ve tested their algorithm on slow slip quakes in the Pacific Northwest. The paper has yet to undergo peer review, but outside experts say the results are tantalizing. According to Johnson, they indicate that the algorithm can predict the start of a slow slip earthquake to “within a few days — and possibly better.”


however..

&gt; The goal of earthquake forecasting has never been to predict slow slips. Rather, it’s to predict sudden, catastrophic quakes that pose danger to life and limb. For the machine learning approach, this presents a seeming paradox: The biggest earthquakes, the ones that seismologists would most like to be able to foretell, are also the rarest. How will a machine learning algorithm ever get enough training data to predict them with confidence?

&gt;The Los Alamos group is betting that their algorithms won’t actually need to train on catastrophic earthquakes to predict them. Recent studies suggest that the seismic patterns before small earthquakes are statistically similar to those of their larger counterparts, and on any given day, dozens of small earthquakes may occur on a single fault. A computer trained on thousands of those small temblors might be versatile enough to predict the big ones.

[],Summerroll9,,,[],,,,text,t2_ta8bg,False,,"Since you went to the trouble of reading at least some of what I linked, I'll reply for the sake of third parties.

&gt;Have you read this?

Yes. Why is this the first time for you, since you claim to do research? Don't worry, I know the answer - because you have been getting all your information from ideological sources that aim to make a profit from misleading you.

&gt;And this is 'settled' science to you?

I never use the term.

&gt;EVERY single paragraph they say 'likely' or 'high confidence'...meaning, we actually have 0 proof of this, we just have come to human conclusions that we believe this to be true.

That's not what it means at all. I guess it's almost tautological to say that climate science deniers don't know how science works, but just so you know in the future, this is how intellectually honest scientists phrase their findings - in terms of probabilities, not absolutes. Scientists are the ultimate sceptics (unlike so-called ""climate sceptics"" who uncritically accept literally anything that supports their predetermined political conclusion), and so scientists never discount the possibility they're wrong, and tend to be conservative and tentative in their statements. 

Specifically for the IPCC, since it's basically a big literature review, they arrive at confidence levels based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of the evidence, then combine it with the level of agreement among the various studies. So they give a quantitative measure of uncertainty, in terms of likelihood, and a qualitative measure, in terms of confidence, of the matrix of agreement and evidence. It's all spelled out in their reports, if you bothered to look.

&gt;We don't even have records beyond 1850, and we are talking about global climate change.

Not instrumental records, no. We do have a multitude of climate proxies to study.

&gt;We need far more data to be conclusive

Oh, is this based on your extensive training and experience in climate science? Or is it an expression of your desire to deny climate science? Hmmmm, gee I wonder.

&gt; this study CLEARLY can not conclusively state either side.

A quick pause to point out the IPCC reports are not studies, they don't do original research. They're a literature review, looking at thousands of studies and putting it all into a big picture. That you don't know this is fairly typical for AGW deniers, because you lot tend to know little about the very basics.

&gt;Nor did you even answer the rest of my questions, because you know damn well the truth that theres absolutely nothing we can do.

I didn't bother, because there's no quick way to answer a complex engineering, economic, political, and social question. Also because you seemed to be stuck at Stage 2 denial (""it's not us doing it""), so it made sense to help that first. Your most recent comment suggests you've advanced to Stage 4 (""we can't do anything about it""), but in my experience that's probably only a rhetorical device that you will deploy at times when the cognitive dissonance gets too much. Later on, you will revert back to Stage 2, maybe Stage 3 (""it's not a problem"").

&gt;This study just showed me also that EVEN IF WE WERE the DIRECT cause, we actually have NO IDEA what will happen.

I only linked you to the physical science basis of our understanding of climate change. If you want an idea of what will happen, [you need to read this one.](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/) Again, the summary will do, given your demostrated knowledge level.

I don’t know where you got the idea that we couldn’t do it if we wanted to. But we could start by changing what we use our land for. But if you ask me, theirs too many people on the planet. We should have found ways to hit get to this point in the first place. Not saying we should kill people or anything crazy like that since it’s too late, just saying we’re too numerous and should find ways to encourage (not force) people to procreate less. Oh, that reminds me. You could do far more good for the environment by not having any kids and not driving a car than you ever could as a vegan.

&gt;	I agree. You only forgot to mention that vegans are more healthy on average.

And you forgot to mention meat eaters encompass very different life styles and dietary choices while vegetarian and vegan tend to be homogeneous in that respect. 

&gt;	Usually because they messed up their nutrition with something like only eating raw food, or because it’s just a fucking hassle. General consumer society does not cater to vegan demand, and the social isolation just through the lack of vegan options in restaurants can be terrible.

Or maybe it’s not the diet we’re meant to subsist off of.  Just look at the nitrogen levels of our ancestors for Christ’s sake, to say we were carnivorous would be an understatement. 

&gt;	Your idea is nonsense. There is no way to feed earths population by grazing.

1.	Well, it would be hard but we could do it. I concede you guys(vegan and plant based movement) will win, probably. I just hope I’m alive to see the consequences of that severely taxing and inadequate diet. I’d bet a million bucks you’re sitting there laughing about how my heart disease or cancer will make that pretty hard.

2.	And your idea is to give everyone a diet we didn’t evolve to eat because of caloric density. One big problem with that though, your body doesn’t count calories. The caloric intake doesn’t dictate what your body does with that energy. Also, don’t p you find it odd that our brain size has decreased by about the size of a tennis ball in the last 15-20 thousand years, coinciding incorporating less meat and more plants via animal extinction and the invention plant agriculture? It’s almost like it’s a hell of a lot easier for our brains to do work if our gut isn’t busy digesting food all the time. If humans didn’t evolve to eat meat why did our cecum and large intestine shrink (areas involved with plant digestion) while our stomach ph dropped and our small intestine grew?

&gt;	They don’t. Where the fuck did you get this idea? Did I miss cows evolving photosynthesis?

It’s because you’re an idiot. If you’re interested, look into yourself. I’m not your professor, I explained it enough for you to get the idea. Here’s some helpful keywords you can use: grassland, pasture raised, net negative
Tl;dr the land does the work, not the cows. Thought that was obviously but in hindsight you are vegan so...

Oh, and for bonus points why don’t you look at what happens to dead land when ruminant animals are put on it?

&gt;	Bullshit. The methane is produced through fermentation during the digestion process. It would not happen close to that level without cows.

And which process is that exactly?

&gt;	In terms of calories yes, but there is no data to assume a carnivore diet might be beneficial over a good plant-based diet. On the contrary, higher meat consumption tends to lead to more cardiovascular problems down the line.

So we can kill EV's faster and otherwise force society to plan out their energy usage around the weather, or we could just use nuclear for baseload.

&gt;There is also the idea that renewables become cheap enough that simply overbuilding capacity and not using it ends up being cheaper than non-renewable energy. Also batteries don't actually need to power the whole grid, just fill in the valleys

That's not how the grid works. Hydroelectric and geothermal are great wherever they can be built, but what about areas where they can't? There is about 40% of the day when neither solar nor wind produce any power, so you could build ten times as much wind and solar as is ever needed, and you will still have **ZERO** energy being produced during 40% of the day. Society cannot handle blackouts, so in a 100% renewables scenario, storage *would* have to provide 100% of the power for 9.2 hours in such regions, requiring an unfathomable amount of costly storage. Or for about 1/5 the cost (even less if it is already built), we could just use nuclear for baseload.

&gt;There's still work to do since most places haven't even reached 80% renewable energy yet.

80%? I hope you understand that every place that has more than 40% ""renewables"" is using hydroelectric for the majority of this figure, not wind and solar. This is a very common tactic that wind and solar advocates use to mislead people into thinking that wind and solar are successfully powering the majority of a grid somewhere in the world. No such feat has ever been accomplished, not even in Germany. Speaking of Germany, applying basic arithmetic to public data, they could have achieved zero-carbon energy years ago for a fraction of the cost of their renewables program, if they had simply built nuclear for baseload. Same with California.

[],yogaman101,,,[],,,,text,t2_m6kdd,False,,"Hmmm.

Intelligence isn't the trait that is always favored by evolution. That would be survival. The ""extra complexity of biological intelligence"" is looking at the process backwards. It's not like some intelligence trait thought through a process of how it would implement itself: ""Shall I be biological? Or inorganic? Hmm."" And it isn't that an intelligent entity grew a biological support system; intelligence is a trait of some animals that have a hugely, massively, extravagantly overgrown structure which once originated as a ""simple"" photo detector in eumatozoa . But the process of evolution at each stage optimized the survival of the host organism, in our lineage, we got opposable thumbs and brains big enough to domesticate ourselves, but in many of the alternate branches that led to our contemporaneous planetary cohabitants, intelligence was not particularly useful, compared to, for example, flight. 

Considering the analogy of intelligence to flight as a highly evolved trait, we have been able to make some things go through the air that look only a little like birds. They weren't initially autonomous or even self-powered. We didn't shun those flying machines for ignoring the digestive system of birds, and we shouldn't expect that intelligence can't exist outside a biological framework.

We should expect that part of what we think about intelligence and consciousness is biased by our biological history and the biological history of everyone we discuss it with. I suspect we won't really agree that some futuristic AI contraption is intelligent or conscious unless it implements some set of pseudo-biological drives for the ""4Fs"" (feed, fight, flee &amp; reproduce), social status, curiosity, etc. But we have a prejudiced point of view, imo. 

Biological systems truly are extraordinarily good at what they do. But the traits we usually call intelligence are not what biological systems are particularly good at. (Try teaching calculus or linear algebra or probability to any biological organism; unless you've picked a fairly small subset of one species, you're likely to be unsuccessful.) Biological systems solve threat avoidance and feeding and limb-eye coordination problems beautifully (with training), but symbol manipulation? Not so much.

""Little to no prior training"" is not the condition of intelligent biological organisms. The more intelligent the organism, as a rule, the longer the period of infantile, parent-supported play. That play conducts large numbers of trials to gather data about the kinds of phenomena that the organism needs to deal with. By the time it gets to your new non-repetitive task, it has a life's worth of experience to guide it in selecting the behavior it chooses in the face of this new situation. It's not magical when it's biological, either.

My opinion is that the reason we don't have much AGI yet agrees with your observation that there has been little attempt to create the kind of resources and ""motivations"" an AGI would need. Game-mastery AIs have only game-oriented drives, use all their memory for game objectives, judge all their behaviors against game-defined criteria, and are not programmed to consider the ""Meaning of Game"" or what other game universes might contain, and worst of all, the universes that they are able test their hypotheses against only respond in ways the programmer has thought to program. There are no diseases, dust, or other left-field surprises that might expand the types of memories it stores. And those memories are generally not episodic and emotionally charged, as are biological memories, so there needs to be a new memory paradigm added as well if we bio-beings are ever to agree that those synthetic intelligences are intelligent. (I think the brittleness of speech and object recognition are analogous to game environments, too.)

If you're aware of anyone taking an approach to AGI similar to what I've sketched, please let me know.

You are trying to disprove the global consensus of scientists in the field, with one subset of data. And you think, I am arrogant and ignorant? 

&gt;Once again, please tell me how people in 2012 are supposed to know that in 2015, the data will be determined as wrong? 

The data isn't wrong. Surface temperature wasn't adjusted. It's only one indicator, that fluctuated. Said fluctuation was used to make the argument ""global warming has stopped"" and to play down the effects of global warming. 

Experts in the field, scientists, knew that there are a lot other indicators.

&gt;Not only was 1998-2012 the warmest 15-year period on record at the time, but greenhouse gases continued to climb to [new record highs](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide), and other climate indicators continued to show the impacts of long-term, global-scale warming: subsurface [ocean heating](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-ocean-heat-content), global [sea level rise](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level), the [melting](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-glacier-mass-balance) of glaciers and ice sheets, and record-low [Arctic sea ice](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-minimum-arctic-sea-ice-extent) extent. 

If you would actually take the time and look at articles of NOAA in the timeframe betwen 1997 to 2012, you would know that. 

Every single GCR from 1997 to 2012 reflect that. Every single one. You can look at them yourself:

 [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/199713](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/199713) 

&gt; You can go back up to my comment and read that I directly addressed it. 

And I answered. 

"" 

&gt;It says that of the 12,000 abstracts on climate science, 4,000 of them expressed an opinion.

1. They don't express opinions, but scientifically reached conclusions. These studies were peer-reviewed.
2. Climate science isn't just about global warming, which is why only 4000 studies were even relevant to the topic.

&gt;Further to that, the study you are referencing didn't get the statements or opinions of the people who wrote the studies. The guy paid some students to read JUST THE ABSTRACT of the studies

The abstracts reflect the findings of the author. Use your brain, please.

""

&gt; I have never contradicted the statements made by Thomas Karl in his report in 2015. 

Yes you have. You said warming in that timeframe wasn't significant. Your source states, that it was significant.

&gt; Warming has continued at a pace similar to that of the last half of the 20th century, and the slowdown was just an illusion. 

This illusion can only arise, when you willfully ignore EVERY SINGLE OTHER INDICATOR. All of these come form NOAA, you prick. 

&gt; Not only was 1998-2012 the warmest 15-year period on record at the time, but greenhouse gases continued to climb to [new record highs](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide), and other climate indicators continued to show the impacts of long-term, global-scale warming: subsurface [ocean heating](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-ocean-heat-content), global [sea level rise](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level), the [melting](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-glacier-mass-balance) of glaciers and ice sheets, and record-low [Arctic sea ice](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-minimum-arctic-sea-ice-extent) extent. 

You don't seem to grasp the indication

&gt; So, we're back to you IGNORING science that doesn't agree with you?  

You are ignoring the big picture and want to focus on a single piece of data. You even misinterpret that data, by saying the warming wasn't significant, when the warming was significant - Just less significant than the 30 years before that.

[],chilltrek97,,,[],,,,text,t2_rq9i3,False,,"&gt; A phenomenon like rain or lightning? Surely they’re both well documented processes? With logical, albeit chaotic, systems generating them. 

Yes, but consider the task of mind upload which as a analogy, it would like transfering rain as in the pattern of water molecules forming a could and the rain that fall from it at a certain location and recreating it somewhere else at another time with the exact shape of the could, exact number of water droplets, exact pattern of water falling down as the rain starts, progresses and then ends. It is not merely the act of creating a rain in another place. Similar lightning would be the pattern of certain air molecules conducting a certain amount of electrons from a certain distance, in a certain shape, with a certain energy from a certain height down to the ground. You can make electrical arcs, but recreating a lightning is imo impossible.

&gt;As for the crux of the OP, if it was possible to fully map a neural network in a human brain and digitise it, whatever turned up in the digital copy would believe it was the original mind, captured at the point of imprinting. 

The assumptions here are many and unknown, nor do they describe a transfer from the original to the copy. What would you tell someone asking if they are to gain immortality but then tell them their body will die?

&gt;If, for example, this mind was allowed a period of existence and transferred back to a biological brain, the mind that appeared in the biological vessel would then report that it had been imprinted then transferred back. It wouldn’t be the consciousness that resides in the original brain, but it would, from it’s own experience, claim that it was. 

Very well but it's a copy, what people really care is the idea of attaining immortality for themselves, not recreating their personality so accurately and deeply that the copy will think itself to be the original. That serves another purpose entirely, to give others the possibility of experiencing you after your death, instead of you, the original.

&gt;From your own current experience of existence are you the same consciousness that woke up this morning as you where when you fell asleep last night? Is there a two way street of current perspective and historical existence? No, it’s called memory. In the proposed scenario how is it any different to waking-sleeping. 

An outside observer that watched the universe from the Big Bang all the way to the formation of our solar system from a gas cloud, through planet evolution and then the individual self replicating molecules all the way through your ancestors and eventually to your parents and your mother that gave birth to you, that observer would attest it is indeed a unique existence with unique gene line, with unique set of atoms that has been in constant evolution with no interruption they could detect.

&gt;The human experience sits on the breaking wave of past and present, eternally riding a stream of consciousness where all that is past is memory and all that is to come is conjecture. We may be able to preserve a mind state for an individual but I don’t think we can preserve the original self whilst doing it. You could copy a mind state and have both exist concurrently, but only one would be the ‘true self’ the other would be a copy which believed that it was the ‘true self’. 

The difference between the original and a copy, however perfect it may be, is that the original as an uninterrupted link to their evolutionary ancestors all the way back to the atoms that were formed in older stars. A copy would not share the same circumstance and more importantly, we ought to define the desire and intention of the original when they decided to have their mind uploaded. Did they wish themselves to continue that uninterrupted link that can be traced back to the beginning or do they want to leave their loved ones and their community a way to communicate with them and remember him after he dies?

&gt;The only factor that could rain on my hypothesis, and this is pretty radical, is that consciousness is actually an n-dimensional expression onto our universe caused by quantum fluctuations of incredibly complex biological or informational systems, reaching a critical point to allow that expression in 3 dimensional space. In that case there could be some kind of horror scenario where ‘you’ would exist at multiple points in multiple vessels experiencing both perspectives.

There is no hypothetical horror situation, the way you are describing immortality by mind upload is that horror situation. We can't transfer a mind no more than we can transfer the clumps of atoms forming data out of 1s and 0s on a HDD to another storage medium. The original states and be recreated but the original atoms expressing those states would not the ones gaining immortality, it would be the pattern they form.",1568618156,{},f0hcae0,False,t3_d4wifk,False,True,t1_f0hay7g,/r/Futurology/comments/d4wifk/science_and_mind_uploading_an_overview/f0hcae0/,1568618156.0,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only makes it difficult to know how much of an impact your actions actually have but also if certain things actually do help. Been wondering about this for a while, especially since I like looking up roughstimates of how much co2 is released when it comes to the production of normal everyday items.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall some sort of report on all your choices and buys would be fun to see how you lie Co2 wise. Been pondering an app where you can add what you purchase and it will then show the best available data of that item and add it up. Next step would be either scanning recites or just have the data fed electronically of all your purchases. If we could then get exacts of how much each and every product do produce and also if it factored in transports you could actually get a very good picture.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't be surprised if apps like this starts coming out soon, especially in Europe where we don't go bonkers about every little database there is. 

I also don't think it's too far-fetched that in the future this sort of data will either be printed on the label of products or otherwise available directly via the company.

That way you could get a relatively accurate (accuracy would probably improve also as time goes by) information of all your choices. That means it would be easier to avoid dirty product and honestly also compete against yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently pulled the data of how dirty the electricity is where I live in terms of Co2/kWh and calculated that against how much we use in our household yearly and was surprised at how little of our Co2 in our hose comes from that. Our cars stands for roughly 1/3 while household electricity for under 10%. The rest is food and other products and services used etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If my household can start switching over to EVs (calcultaed against how dirty our energy mix is) that would reduce our households emissions by almost 1/3 but those rest % not accounted for I have no idea just because it's so intangible. I know meat and dairy reduction would be good, in general buying less things and buying more locally but like I have no numbers to rely on and that makes it difficult.

* Like pointing out that [4 giant corporations](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/merck-pfizer-sanofi-pasteur-and-glaxosmithkline-make-billions-from-shingrix-and-gardasil-vaccines.html) have monopolized the vaccine industry.  
* Point out a [study that regresses the number of vaccines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/) administered against infant mortality rate, which shows the countries who vaccinate the most have the highest death rates, as much as 3x higher than those who vaccinate less often.   
* If you don't believe those facts used because the power of denial is kicked in, I can back them up with [data from the government](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html) which also agrees that infants in Serbia, and Bosnia, are more likely to survive than those growing up in the USA. 
* [I can point out stories](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/merck-whistleblowers_b_5881914.html) where the people making the vaccines having come out as whistle blowers against the vaccine makers, claiming the 'empirical data' people refer to is a bunch of lies, because they were the scientists doing the tests and know better, which has led to governments trying to lay charges on these corporations.  The only plausible reason for them to commit career suicide like that is because they have strong morals and principals, and don't want to see people get hurt. . . .yet the pro vaccine crowd will try to rationalize it somehow.  Perhaps telling themselves they were part of a shadow network of spies looking to infiltrate these saintly corporations to do their reputations harm.  
* Or [studies out of Yale University](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/02/21/vaccines-linked-to-mental-disorders-by-yale-study/) showing that children who've been vaccinated see an increased rate of mental disorders later on in life.   
* I can point out that these corporations will [bribe doctors to push dangerous medications](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/02/john-kapoor-opioids-billionaire-founder-guilty-of-bribing-doctors-to-prescribe) that all parties involved except the patient know are dangerous.  
* And how the [government will look the other way](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/19/big-pharma-money-lobbying-us-opioid-crisis) if those same companies are willing to offer them the same treatment as the doctors.  
* Or occasions it's the [government asking the medical and pharmaceutical industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Experiments) because it's them wanting to intentionally kill some of us, because they are curious how fast we will die, how many people we will infect before dying, and whether or not people will question authority and seek a second opinion.  
* An expose on how [pathogens keep magically](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/20/18260669/deadly-pathogens-escape-lab-smallpox-bird-flu) escaping from labs despite regulations that prevent it.

* [The British Medical Journal.](https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d5956)  
* Or other studies showing dangerous effects in what's considered the [top medical journal](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736(93)91069-X/fulltext) in the world.  
* Or I could even bring up that the 4 corporations who have monopolized the vaccine industry have repeatedly shown again, and again, proven beyond a shadow of any doubt they will commit unspeakable horrors.  Disasters to the environment, tax evasion, tax fraud, fraud, manipulation of results, [intentionally infecting people with HIV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785997) in order to help build up more of a market for AIDS drugs, and on, and on.  Even lying about the effects of a drug that was killing people in trials, cover it up, and launch it so they can kill people on a mass scale, for profit.  The fines are only a fraction of the profits made if the cover-up can last long enough, and as they dominate the medical research field with those profits, and the public shames anyone who doesn't support the corporations, few are willing to do such research, and those who are have an extremely difficult time trying to get funding to do so.  
* Or that [GSK](https://www.corp-research.org/glaxosmithkline), [Merck](https://www.corp-research.org/merck), [Pfizer](https://www.corp-research.org/pfizer), they have rap sheets so long that would make all gangs, mafia, and cartels blush, because their body counts were much smaller.

That kind of dataset with a bad median is much harder to find, though, since it relies on a significant jump in value in the middle of the data that the median doesn't capture (nor would the mode.

That's a rhetorical failure of over action.

Their demands for a government research committee on the effects of vaccines, vaccine safety and vaccine injury are not unreasonable an not particularly expensive considering it will aide in moving past the issue, and offering an olive branch, at worst case scenario antivaxers demands on vaccines would be the removal of mercury and certain aldehydes which are doable and a longer vaccination period meaning MMR becomes 3 shots again and the dozen plus vaccinations an infant needs would start later and happen over a longer period because of a limit of 1-2 inoculations in a week.

Anyone seeing that as ironic demonstrates a pretty shallow understanding of media. 

Back when Marshall McLuhan came up with the forumulation ""the medium is the message"" to explain the differences in how we experience, say, the same movie in the theater vs watching it on TV, mediums were pretty self contained. Radio was radio, TV was TV, print was print. 

But the internet, and especially the web, are ""metamedia,"" or mediums that can be used to contain any previously existing media. We now have user experience toolkits that we can use to build specialized media experiences that resemble other media but differ in key ways and therefore have different societal effects.

Take Pandora and Spotify for example: We describe them both as ""streaming music services"" but the older media they contain are different. Pandora is primarily a radio service while Spotify is a music library that replaces boxes of CDs. 

Similarly, we have this catch-all term ""social media"" but what exactly does it mean? Basically all it describes is an online service through which users interact directly with each other. ""Social media"" was coined to describe websites rising in the mid-00s which had these interactions as their primary features, but this was hardly new territory for the internet — it was only that the web was finally maturing enough to do the things that older protocols like Usenet, as well as non-internet BBSes, has done well in the '80s.

Each social network site is designed using the same toolkit, but the choices made are unique. This is why Facebook is not the same as Twitter and Twitter is not the same as YouTube and YouTube is not the same as LinkedIn.

Of course there are many design differences between Facebook and Reddit but the key one — and the reason why I finally ditched FB myself — is the way they treat identity. Facebook's model is designed to require your real name and your real network. Reddit's model is designed to encourage pseudonymity and the creation of identity (or identities) independent of your real name.

So here's one big way that matters. I'm pontificating here about all this media stuff as though I have advanced degrees in studying it, but in truth I'm just a rando on Reddit. I may be an expert in this field, or I may be faking it. If we were having this discussion on Facebook, you'd know my name and from that you could better judge whether or not I know what I'm talking about.

The stakes are lower in a pseudonymous environment. You may disagree with me (I'm sure someone will because Reddit), but the disagreement happens at a remove. There's less investment in it. If this reply leads me into one of those pointless arguments, I'm not going to get wound up and my blood pressure won't spike.

The stakes are high on Facebook because your real name and identity are tied to your interactions. If someone challenges you, they are actually challenging you. If someone says something you profoundly disagree with, it is tied to your actually relationship with that person.

Before I ditched Facebook, my blood pressure would spike multiple times a day as I'd see relatives repost crazy bullshit from one side of the political spectrum then old friends repost crazy bullshit from the other side of the political spectrum. I had people whose posts had become nothing but pro-vegan statements and people whose posts had become nothing but pro-keto carnivore statements. I had anti-vaxxers and medical researchers side by side. It was a hellhole that felt designed to make me hate all these people who I had formerly loved.

Reddit is based around the pre-web community idea of affinity groups. You sign up for ""rooms"" (aka ""subs"") where people with similar interests discuss specified topics. If you don't like the sub community you're free to leave without leaving the site.

Facebook doesn't work that way. The design is primarily about the newsfeed because that's where they get the data they make their money from. They've tried to put more emphasis on pages (aka ""subs"") to shift the focus from personal identity to affinity groups, but in the end the value of the site comes from each person being the topic of their own affinity group and then mining the hell out of the relationships uncovered through it.

So yeah. Facebook and Reddit are both ""social media,"" but only in the same way that a newspaper and a novel are both ""print media."" Anyone who thinks they've zinged you by saying liking Reddit but disliking Facebook is hypocritical doesn't actually understand the different ways we experience the two sites.

This isn't to say Reddit is without flaws, of course. It's got tons of them. But some fundamental design decisions made early on have kept it from being as socially destructive as Zuckerberg's monster has turned out to be.",1567956123,{},ezk7bzh,False,t3_d17vl5,False,True,t1_ezil4wz,/r/Futurology/comments/d17vl5/the_polarization_of_our_society_is_actually_part/ezk7bzh/,1567956129.0,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US wanted the remaining reactors shut down, and was willing to offer stuff to Ukraine to make it happen.  

One issue was jobs for the workers.  Ukraine had the bright idea that they could set up an economic development zone and attract foreign industry.  They planned to get General Motors to put a car plant and Sony to put an electronics plant there.  (I think it was Sony, long time ago.)

I was pulled into a meeting at Slavutych because the Ukrainians realized that GM and Sony wouldn't build there just because the Ukrainians said it was safe.  No, they wanted the US Govt to publish an analysis saying it was safe.  Cause everyone believes the US Govt on these things, right?

My role was as a member of a govt agency that would perform human health risk assessments of radioactive contamination sites in the US.  I was fairly junior, but I was already in Ukraine on a support mission, so I got pulled in.  The State Dept guy wanted to know if such an assessment could be done.  I didn't think my agency could even legally do that work without Congressional legislation and a giant budget boost.  

State guy: ""that's not what I'm asking... can it be done?""

Ukrainians: ""Has to be done before we shut down the other units.""

State:  ""Can it be done in 6 months?""

Me: ""Uhhh, not to our standards.  We have to drill wells and pull water samples.  We have to install weather stations to understand winds, precipitation, etc.  We have to grab soil, water, air, flora, and fauna samples in all seasons to catch seasonal changes.  It's a giant site, so we're talking a huge effort, many samples, then many lab analyses of the samples, then a lot of data crunching to estimate long term health effects for workers.  It's more than an order of magnitude bigger than anything I've ever worked on.  These projects drag on for years even for small regions in the US.""

Ukrainians:  ""No, no.  We already have all that info.  Lots of measurements, samples, etc.  You just have to review it and write it up.""

Wrong.  Human doctors using big data AI tools are more accurate than any AI alone.  

AI does not currently do a good job of doing what a doctor does which is integrating information from many sources (patient history, previous labs), choosing further methods of diagnosis, and then implementing and monitoring treatment.  It does best with problems that already have large data sets and very few variables for inputs and outputs.  

Most importantly, AI has to constantly be retrained with newer methods of diagnosis and treatment in medicine.  Who does that programming?  Software Engineers and most importantly doctors.

And its not like it ends there, there has been a massive rise in kidney issues as we have pushed heavy NSAIDs for chronic usage (which it is not supposed to be used for, especially in peeps with GI issues but we do it anyway cuz fuck it!).  

Prescription opioids contributed to it, but it is definitely not more than a quarter of the problem, if it was then why did germany have a massive rise in prescription opiates and no significant increase in ODs?  Why does an average prescription opioid OD have 5 other major drugs in their system as well?  Benzos and alcohol are by far the most prevalent drugs found in prescription opioid ODs.

Why have drug overdoses from stimulants and other drug classes besides opioids risen over 200% from 1999 (opioids is around 300%)?  If it was just prescription opioids, why have deaths skyrocketed since prescriptions have been slashed since 2011 levels?  

Wouldn't we expect the opposite?  The reality is there are way more factors than just pharma bad, pill mill bad, doctor bad.  If you think that simple mindly, you're gonna just continue to see an increase in drug ODs, suicide, mental health issues, despair, mass shootings, acts of violence, worsening physical health, more chronic disease, as we've been seeing during a time that just happened to correspond almost perfect with the increase in prescription opioids.

The pain movement started in 1999, right as the tech bubble was collasping and the start of the major wealth inequality and loss of middle class that we see today, and has accelerated during the exact time period that opiates skyrocketed as well.  So it makes it so that you can easily just see the correlation between prescription opiates and all these deaths, but if you look into the data like geographic areas affected by mass unemployment and other effects of automation, you see that the highest incidences of all those negatives attributed to prescription opiates occurred.

Opiates are a great antidepressant and good for dealing with emotional pain, just like many other hardcore drugs are.  Its no wonder that all these places had mass ODs of drugs, and would go to doctors to get them if it was relatively easy to get.

Various left wing parties around the world (including in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and most of Scandanavia) have enacted more pro market policies that liberalized the economy. Republican's in contrast tend not to, but instead prioritize the spread of socially conservative values and cracking down on LBGT rights and keeping drugs illegal etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Setting aside that a ""free, competitive market"" mathematically functions exactly like a monopoly, the economy of scale means larger businesses make more profit

Every liberalized economy has less monopolies and oligopolies present than a country with more restrictive barriers. If you want to encourage a monopolies existence, then that monopoly needs government support to maintain itself.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And ""every"" economist (that got platformed by corporate media and given cushy jobs in far-right thinktanks) said financial deregulation was a good idea, and we still haven't recovered from the crash those free market cultists caused

The financial crisis was caused by the Bush administration and Federal reserve flushing cheap credit into the economy in an effort to boost home ownership for low income earners. The financial crisis was caused by government, not but market forces. A good book on the Financial Crisis is Financial Fiasco by Johan Norberg. Or to examine that practices of government backed banking monopolies such as Fannie Mae and Fredie Mac (abbreviations for government agencies/banking monopolies created by the federal government that played a large roll in actually causing the financial crisis to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond that, the negative effects of supply management are failry well documented by the experts in Canada, not only by economists, but also other academics includ former Liberal Party MP (the liberals are a centre left party here in Canada) Martha Hall-Findlay who's currently at academic at the University of Calgary's school of Public Policy Here summery of the problems with supply management and the benefits of Liberalization are available here in this peer reviewed [article.](https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/supply-management-hall-findlay.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

and again this is supported by the data and evidence available. As Findlay cites in her paper, and as is documented by actual empirical evidence. Australia an New Zealand abolished their supply management policies and farm subsidies while providing short term compensation to the effected industries until they transitioned and were able to face an open market. The results were overwhelmingly positive for the Agricultural sector, the average farmer and the economy as a whole. New Zealand to this day has no trade barriers in it's agricultural sector at all and is doing far better as a result of abolishing it's supply management program.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha. No. Over the 20th century the strongest and fastest gains were always in socialist countries,

&amp;#x200B;

The evidence is completely at odds with your argument here. If we look at the real world effects of policy, those gains have come from liberalization. Let's take India as an example. From Independence in 1947 to pre liberalization in 1991. The Indian economy was not only stagnated, but little to not gains were made in reducing poverty or encouraging development. The countries centrally planned economy was constantly failing and little to no improvements in India's living standards were gained under the socialist policies of the first 44 years of the countries existence. However under liberalization, India's poverty not only fell, but standards of living and wage growth grew substantially. Liberalization of the pharmaceutical industry in particular allowed the prices of drugs to fall substantially and become affordable to India's numerous poor.

Two Good articles to examine the effects of the liberalizations are examining India (as well as China's poverty rates before and after market liberalization):   [https://archive.indiaspend.com/wp-content/uploads/graph-1-new.png](https://archive.indiaspend.com/wp-content/uploads/graph-1-new.png)

regions like Kerela in India didn't actually begin to see growth or an increase in development in living standards until India liberalized it's economy in 1991. If Kerala was already doing that well before India's reforms, your argument might hold water, but examing Kerala's economy,  development didn't occur until after liberalization.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala#Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala#Economy)

&gt;After independence, the state was managed as a [democratic socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism) [welfare economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economy). From the 1990s, [liberalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism) of the [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy) allowed [Licence Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_Raj) restrictions against capitalism and [foreign direct investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment) to be lightened, leading to economic expansion and an increase in employment.

Liberalization's benefits are again showing by impoverished countries transitioning to developed countries including, Vietnam, Cambodia Laos, Chilie, the countries in Africa seeing the most growth etc. If you look at the most impoverished countries around the world, they are the ones with the highest trade barriers and most closed off economies. Countries like Botswana and Ethiopia are ones that are materializing the most growth and improvement in living standards in Africa and that is a direct result of economic liberalization.

As African Economist [George Ayittey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGfaR4wBGo) points out, one of the reasons why poverty in Africa has remained so persistent is because the continent has been so slow to liberalize. Many African government regimes implemented closed economies because they confused the colonialist/mercantalist systems with capitalism, but it's been the African countries that have embraced free trade and open markets that have done the most to boost their countries living standards.",1567292187,{},eyp7fni,False,t3_cx89f7,False,True,t1_eymrr1f,/r/Futurology/comments/cx89f7/the_next_recession_will_destroy_millennials/eyp7fni/,1567294458.0,1,True,,False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,1567293717.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; Gun reform

The problem isn't guns. It's people.

There's no relationship between gun ownership rates and homicides on a state by state basis, nor on the basis of racial groups, and there's an inverse correlation between gun ownership rates and homicide rates on the rural-urban cline (urban areas have the highest homicide rates, rural ones the highest gun ownership rates).

Shrieking about guns is, I'm afraid, scapegoating. It is a means of blaming those rural white people (who don't vote for Democrats) for the extremely high homicide rates amongst majority-minority urban communities (who do).

Non-hispanic white people own the overwhelming majority of guns in the US, and yet do not commit the majority of homicides. [Blacks commit about 50% of homicides in the US and Hispanics about 20%.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-2.xls) Non-Hispanic whites only commit about 1 in 4 homicides each year.

These numbers also align with CDC data on homicide victims by race, which isn't surprising - about 90% of homicides are committed against a member of your own racial group.

&gt; extending free schooling from 12 years to 16

The problem is that this is a huge waste of money.

Only about half the population is intellectually capable of going to college and benefitting from it; the other half is not intellectually capable of completing college-level coursework. About half of Americans have basic or below-basic literacy levels (this is true in Europe as well, incidentally), which is just too low to do college work.

Moreover, most jobs don't require a college education, so it's a waste of time and money to keep people in school for that long.

On top of that, there's other things - like apprenticeship programs and associates degrees and whatnot - which are frequently more appropriate.

Indeed, the US has one of the highest rates of college completion globally, and the push to get more people into college is part of why you're seeing student loan issues - the people who tend to be the biggest losers are the people who are not intellectually capable of doing the coursework but who go to college anyway, so fail to earn a diploma, but still rack up a lot of debt - and because they're on the lower end of the spectrum intellectually, are more likely to borrow too much money as well, because they don't really think about how hard it will be to pay it back or think it will be much easier than it is. These are also obviously not people who are going to be getting academic scholarships, so that's no help either.

It's just dumb to throw good money after bad on sending everyone to college. I went to college and it was great, but it isn't for everyone - not everyone wants to go, about half the population isn't capable of doing the work, and it's a big investment for a poor ROI for the people who aren't already going, by and large.

&gt; evil with their plans for healthcare

People's concerns with healthcare is that government-run systems have issues with scarcity. I have a friend in Canada who has to wait six months for an appointment, and getting into the system at all for chronic issues was an enormous hassle that took months to do.

In the US, we get health care much more promptly, but at a higher price.

Moreover, in government-run systems, there's a lack of personal choice, which rubs people the wrong way for obvious reasons.

Most people are happy with the health care they get right now, the biggest issue is cost, and costs are actually primarily being driven by the fact that individuals *aren't* paying for health care - if people actually had to pay for their own health care, doctors and surgeons couldn't afford to charge you hundreds of thousands of dollars for procedures.",1567200398,{},eym625q,False,t3_cx89f7,False,True,t1_eyktmeh,/r/Futurology/comments/cx89f7/the_next_recession_will_destroy_millennials/eym625q/,1567200399.0,1,True,,False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALL companies do that to 1 degree or another. Those big data sets and patterns/predictions are used in a lot of helpful ways to:

* predict traffic patterns to give you better Google Maps tips

* to warn you about food shortages or sickness (bad lettuce or other viral infections) 

* to predict home-ownership or crime in certain neighborhoods,etc

That attitude of ""Pattern-recognition can only be BAD!!""... is not logical or fair. 

Big data and pattern recognition can be GOOD or BAD. What that end result is just depends on how we use it (and how much critical-thinking we put into how we use the tools).

Detecting this from a phone is possible and there have been experimental android distributions that warn you or outright refuse to connect to unencrypted stations. If you have a compatible device (Qualcomm chipset and rooted) you can install SnoopSnitch to detect fake base stations.

If someone wants to decrypt your data on 3G and later they need the provider to cooperate or clone your SIM card, in which case no level of encryption will protect you, but this applies to any kind of encrypted connection, including TLS and similar.

This is wrong.

&gt;There is so many tricks and innovative things we can do to lower latency. But it is very difficult to remove the speed of light aspect.

This is wrong, in the sense that you don't seem to understand that **the speed of light in space is not the same as the speed of light in a fiberoptic cable**. Basic physics my dude.


Putting satellites in LEO one of the *only* innovative things we can do to reduce latency because it's something like a 30% increase in speed. You just need 30% of the distance to be greater than the up/down distance, which it easily is and then some over intercontinental distances.

Another important thing to realize is that

&gt;There is a reason more data centers are being build with Google spending $13 billion in 2019. It is to lower the distance on land between person and server.

This is *totally and utterly irrelevant in every possible way* when we're talking about the applications of a low latency connection for uses in say, high frequency stock trading across the ocean. There are times, times which are incredibly vitally important to big businesses, when you need to be the first person to react (via automated processes) to some new information about the stock market (or act on the stock market based on *non* stockmarket information). 10 milliseconds can be worth millions or billions of dollars potentially. 

For this type of application you cannot cheat the speed of light. There's absolutely no doing it known to modern science, to the best of our knowledge the absolute theoretical maximal speed would be if you could directly transmit data point to point at the speed of light in a vacuum, but that's impossible.

Now assuming you can get the transfer delay between your satelites to nil, and transfer in a straight line (obviously impossible, but you can get close), you gain roughly 30% of the distance involved in a point to point connection compared to a fiberoptic cable. Eg if 30% of the distance is greater than the distance up to the first satellite and down to the ground again, then you're better off transmitting your packet by space than you are by transmitting it on the ground.

Now as an example Halifax to london is 2873 miles, 30% of that is 861.9 miles, so by going by space you 'gain' about 182 miles.

Now this *specific* route maybe isn't something where you could gain advantage through using a technology like starlink.

However new york to the Shenzen stock exchange in china is about 8030 miles, 30% of that is 2418 miles, which could easily equate to a massive advantage for anyone using starlink. 

A reasonable estimate for the speed advantage of starlink would be around 15%, which would net you maybe 15-30ms of advantage in an industry where people are willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on 5ms or so.


And keep in mind this is compared to direct point to point cables, consumer connections are much slower, so while the primary focus of starlink is large businesses, private customers should actually see relatively larger gains and while going from LA to LA servers will be faster by land, if you're going coast to coast or farther it will almost certainly be faster in all cases.",1569285283,{},f1a4x4f,False,t3_d68vxf,False,True,t1_f0rwabp,/r/technology/comments/d68vxf/spacex_wants_to_beam_internet_across_the_southern/f1a4x4f/,1569287637.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This one is especially funny. Babies start with the inherited brains that have taken only a few billion years to develop. Even without this, any modern computer can certainly get through millions of pictures of faces in orders of magnitude faster than months.

[],Mazon_Del,,,[],,,,text,t2_aeqld,False,,"&gt; ""Baseless"" is a big understatement as the claims that SpaceX has actively made are baseless. A big part of WHY satellite internet hasn't taken off is because of how the earth rotates and distance between signal and receiver. If you wanted to do anything fast on those preexisting satellites you are shit out of luck. Instead Musk is saying we just throw more up there and rely on that tech just working without errors. There is no true way to know they are going to deliver the product they say they are for the price they say without actually having our hands on the product which hasn't happened yet.

This completely misses how Starlink is supposed to operate.

Current Satellite hasn't taken off as a replacement for ground internet because that was never its purpose. The intention of satellite ISPs was to provide service in areas around the world that could not get it through other means (such as out in the ocean or in backcountry areas). The REASON it is slow is twofold, but both originate from the same cause. The satellites used for current internet are in fairly high orbits, far enough away from the ground that even light takes reasonable fractions of a second just to move one leg. The reasons these satellites were put up so high is so that way it takes fewer satellites to cover the majority of the planet (excluding the poles really), fewer satellites means more customers per satellite. Despite how capable these satellites are, you inevitably are going to throttle the average consumer down just to make sure you've got capacity. Similarly, quite frequently these satellites are coopted for other means (ex: there is a system in place for the US military to emergency request bandwidth on satellites owned by US based ISPs). So in short, you have fewer, bigger satellites, but against the scale of a planet there is only so good they can be.

Starlink operates the other way around. MANY more satellites that are far closer to the ground. The round-trip time is now back down to comparable levels with ground based infrastructure. Since you need more satellites just to see the whole service area of the planet, you end up in a situation where each satellite individually handles fewer customers. Signals can be routed through satellites in view of the first node that consumer sees that have lesser message traffic. The system as a whole operates as a large mesh network. Mesh networks have been shown to operate quite well in smaller scale tests and there isn't a whole lot of reason to believe it will fail in a larger network, particularly since the Starlink scenario is TECHNICALLY an easier problem. In standard mesh networking, you have no idea what the topography/shape of the network is going to be. Units dropping in/out of the network or moving around such that neighboring nodes are unpredictable, etc. Starlink on the other hand, once the satellites have finished reaching their operational orbit after deployment, every satellite is going to know exactly where the other ones are at any given point in time, so message routing doesn't end up that much more complex than standard ground systems. Consumers on the ground at this point are comparable to homes connecting to the internet for standard systems. GENERALLY speaking a given connection is going to be located roughly in the same spot nearly always. Some users do move around, sometimes large distances. None of that is new.

Is the system likely to have teething problems? Well sure, nothing built by man doesn't.

What is the systems likely cost? Well you can't claim Musk is bullshitting about costs because we haven't actually heard anything solid from anyone in the know about A) what the cost of the system is going to be to use or B) what the use-case even is. There's a nonzero chance that Starlink will start up and only support rural communities, or perhaps even it only exists to provide extra connectivity and bandwidth to current ISPs and the average citizen isn't going to be able to get a transceiver. We just don't know yet.

&gt; Moreover there is no guarantee that SpaceX won't raise their prices to compensate for their own greed in a year or two when people gut out their regular wifi connections.

Oh but there is! There's the simple fact that our ISPs can provide is with far better internet for far less money than they do now. If people spite-buy Starlink to the point where the ISPs are seeing a serious threat...then the ISPs are just going to drop their prices and increase their services. The internet is loaded with stories where within days of Google Fiber declaring it was coming to some city, the ISPs announcing a ""free upgrade"" or somesuch that suddenly brought everyone to near-fiber levels. Plus at the end of the day, there IS always municipal networks. There's one near me that was set up by the local town, it exists as a zero-profit enterprise. The town paid for the setup with tax money, but then after that all ongoing costs and expenses are covered by the customers with the prices being geared to ensure an absolute minimum of profit. As cheap as Starlink MIGHT be able to operate, there's no way any profit oriented business can compete with a company that explicitly is trying NOT to make a profit.

&gt; Secondly why would anyone use Comcast or Century Link IF Musk is accurate? Because IF Musk is accurate and he can get you gigabit download speeds basically anywhere in the country why in the ever living fuck would you pay for Comcast or Century Link or otherwise as, after all you are going to be paying the SAME PRICE for a lesser product.

You are putting words in Musk's mouth. Musk has never said that Starlink is going to be superior to what ground based internet CAN provide EXCEPT insofar as it is technically a mobile system (if you put a Starlink transceiver in your car it will work, good luck trying that with a cable modem) but the average usecase is going to just be a static structure. Musk has CONTINUOUSLY declared that he views Starlink as simply sidegrade. To put things in a comparison, if you are trying to send data across an ocean right now you have satellite communications AND undersea cables working together to provide this service. Both have their uses for this service. He has never said that Starlink is a cable-killer and insinuating that he has is dishonest.

&gt; Which isn't true at all. Comcast never competed with Google Fiber as they fought and stacked legal courts via lobbying to make sure states would write laws saying that Google can't lay lines down because Comcast now owns those lines. The few places they did they only did so for as long as Google could actually lay down lines which they actively fought to stop on a legal and government basis, as soon as Google wasn't allowed to lay down lines they immediately upped their prices and lowered their quality.

I'm sorry but that is ALMOST entirely incorrect.

CC and GF have competed. When GF first set up, part of the method that happened was that Google bought up a bunch of the infrastructure (that your tax paying dollars paid for) that current ISPs just had turned off and in the ground (aka: Dark fiber). While it was a bit more than just turning on a switch, a lot of equipment was already in place.

LATER once the current ISPs stopped collectively shitting themselves at the idea of having a real competitor is when they started getting obstructionist concerning the utilities poles that they already owned. There are no laws that say Google CANNOT lay down new lines, but there's the economics of it. In developed areas, all the cheap places to put lines have been used already. If Google cannot secure use of that same infrastructure, the only way to lay new lines is to dig it deeper (and quite frequently using drills rather than trench equipment) which raises the price of setting up systems by literally orders of magnitude. It would make no economic sense for Google to do so. And Google has no guarantee of being able to use someone elses poles/pipes for the same reason that nobody else has a guarantee of being able to use Googles poles/pipes, because while there IS an ability to 'force' a company to let a competitor use their infrastructure, it was never meant for laying an entire second grid on top of that persons infrastructure. It was meant for those moments when you really desperately needed those ten poles/pipes over there. There just is no way to say ""I need access to everything you have."" because that was never considered.

tldr: You have ALMOST, but not quite, zero idea what you are talking about.

Adam Neumann was flying high. Literally.

His office-rental giant WeWork was months away from being valued at $47 billion. Revenue was doubling annually. And Mr. Neumann was zipping across the Atlantic Ocean in a Gulfstream G650 private jet with friends last summer, smoking marijuana.

After the group landed in Israel and left the plane, the flight crew found a sizable chunk of the drug stuffed in a cereal box for the return flight, according to people familiar with the incident. The jet’s owner, upset and fearing repercussions of trans-border marijuana transport, recalled the plane, leaving Mr. Neumann to find his own way back to New York, these people said.

Since Mr. Neumann co-founded WeWork—recently renamed We Co.—with Miguel McKelvey nine years ago, he has led with unusual exuberance and excess. His combination of entrepreneurial vision, personal charisma and brash risk-taking helped the company surpass $2 billion in annual revenue, and made it the country’s most valuable startup.

Now many of the same qualities that helped fuel his company’s breakneck growth in the private market are piling up as potential liabilities as the company prepares to go public—helmed by a CEO who looks little like a typical public-company chief.

Mr. Neumann muses about the implausible: becoming leader of the world, living forever, amassing more than $1 trillion in wealth. Partying has long been a feature of his work life, heavy on the tequila.

Public investors are increasingly skeptical of the formula that has worked for Mr. Neumann so far: his pitch that We is far more than a real-estate company. With its rapid growth and use of technology, he argued, the company deserves rich valuations normally reserved for tech companies.

Instead, many potential investors now see a fast-growing office subleasing company with losses of more than $1.6 billion last year.

Since We filed the prospectus for its initial public offering last month, it has been besieged with criticism over its governance, business model and ability to turn a profit. It is now expecting an IPO valuation as low as a third of the $47 billion sticker price it garnered in a January funding round—a drop without recent precedent. This week, We postponed the offering until October at the earliest.

Wall Street and Silicon Valley investors have been dismayed by the number of potential conflicts of interest disclosed in the “S-1” IPO prospectus, including Mr. Neumann leasing properties he owns back to the company and borrowing heavily against his stock. Even some of We’s private investors said they were angered to learn that an entity Mr. Neumann controls sold the rights to the word “We” to the company for almost $6 million—before public pressure led him to unwind the deal.

“This is not the way everybody behaves,” said Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter Inc., who led the company through one of the larger tech IPOs of the past decade. “The degree of self-dealing in the S-1 is so egregious, and it comes at a time when you’ve got regulators and politicians and folks across the country looking out at Silicon Valley and wondering if there’s the appropriate level of self-awareness.”

Given the prominence of the IPO, he added, “that is a big problem.”

Mr. Neumann, 40, declined to comment through a spokesman, who cited rules surrounding the planned IPO. Mr. Neumann told We employees Tuesday the process had been humbling and he would learn from it, say people who heard him. We executives have previously said he is strongly devoted to the company, and many of his personal transactions were made with the company’s best interests at heart.

This account is based on interviews with current and former employees, investors and friends who interacted with Mr. Neumann as he built We.

For startup investors, the 6-foot-5 Mr. Neumann has always had the qualities they crave in Silicon Valley founders, despite being based in New York. He is intensely ambitious and a masterful storyteller with a magnetic personality who can inspire and sell.

Raised in Israel on a kibbutz, Mr. Neumann moved to the U.S. when he was 22, where he attended Baruch College and tried to start businesses. One was a collapsible heel on women’s shoes that didn’t get off the ground. Working out of his Tribeca apartment, he started Krawlers, which sought to make baby clothes with knee pads to make crawling more comfortable. The slogan, he has said: “Just because they don’t tell you, doesn’t mean they don’t hurt.” It never gained traction.

He and Mr. McKelvey started a small co-working space on the side during the recession that followed the financial crisis and were amazed by the demand.


By 2010, they had started WeWork, with essentially the same core business model that exists today: They lease an office long-term, renovate it to make it hip and inviting, and sublease smaller desks and offices short-term.

Early on, Mr. Neumann painted a picture of how WeWork was connecting entrepreneurs and others who in the past would have worked from home or in coffee shops; how the company would bring a new way of working to a changing world.

The founders planned for the “We” brand to expand beyond office space into other categories such as housing and finance. Mr. Neumann ramped up its image as a tech company as it grew.

It introduced a mobile app for network members, meant to facilitate a “physical social network.” The company emphasized its data and how it was using artificial intelligence to glean insights about buildings.

Past funders and employees tell stories of how an animated Mr. Neumann convinced them within minutes to believe in the company’s epic future.

“When I met him, after a couple of minutes, I wanted to invest,” said Joey Low, whose Star Farm Ventures put money into the company in 2013 and multiple subsequent funding rounds. “He was hungry for success—that was for sure.”

Even former executives who disliked Mr. Neumann give him credit for an extraordinary ability to motivate employees and push the company.

He forgoes many conventions of the standard, buttoned-up CEO. He pushed for rowdy parties in the early days. He often walks barefoot around the office. In an earlier office, he blared songs by pop-star Rihanna while a trainer held a punching bag for him, and then walked around afterward while still sweaty from the exertion.

Like some high-profile CEOs in tech, he hopes to live forever, according to three people who heard him say this, and has invested in life-extension startup Life Biosciences LLC.

It says its mission is “to create a future where age-related decline is not a fact of life.”

As WeWork grew, Mr. Neumann took on ever more investment, bringing in tens of millions of dollars from venture capitalists, then hundreds of millions from mutual funds T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Investments. Crucially, he secured full control of the company in 2014 when investor demand was high—getting shares with 10 times the votes of others.

Ultimately he found a kindred spirit in Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank Group Corp., who, like Mr. Neumann, is a risk-taker who respects giant bets. Mr. Son, a telecom veteran who raised the world’s largest tech fund in 2017, met Mr. Neumann in India in 2016 and pondered an investment.

SoftBank first committed $3.1 billion in new funding in 2017. Mr. Neumann has told others that Mr. Son appreciated how he was crazy—but thought that he needed to be crazier. A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment.

Many former employees said they didn’t always know how seriously to take some of Mr. Neumann’s pronouncements. Early on, he would throw out seemingly random ideas, like adding a pool in the basement of the company’s headquarters or starting an airline.

He told at least one person directly that his ambitions included becoming Israel’s prime minister. More recently, he said that if he ran for anything, it would be president of the world, according to another person who spoke with him.",1568865458,{},f0qsczh,False,t3_d615te,False,True,t3_d615te,/r/technology/comments/d615te/this_is_not_the_way_everybody_behaves_how_adam/f0qsczh/,1568865468.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

State power has always seems arbitrary to me and rests eventually on brute force; that is, prisons and killing as punishment for not heeding its directives. One might say, and this is the crux of the argument for the state, that “government is by the people, for the people and of the people.” Well and good. But it’s actually not. Elections are a sham, representation doesn’t account for 50% who didn’t chose the sitting authority, law and order is often a tool for the powerful to suppress dissidents and rights groups.

I'm a cellular engineer of 13 years.

First of all GSM has one pilot channel that is 200 KHz and carrier channels with 7 timeslots each that are 30KHz. I don't know where your numbers are coming from.

For CDMA:
The chipping rate of CDMA is not impossible to emulate but it is very difficult for you to emulate a a CDMA tower because the phones have a list of acceptable towers given to it by the network and it is hard for a fake tower to convince the network who it is. This is not impossible but the hardware needed to create a CDMA channel is much larger and more complicated than a GSM channel.

For LTE:

Modulation rate is defined by the radio and QPSK and QAM have been supported from the beginning.
The pilot channel uses a zadoff-chu modulation because it easier to demodulate for the UE.
The shared channel which moves the data has the variable modulate rate which supports QPSK, 16qam, 64qam, and 256qam.
The radio tells the UE what modulation rate to use.

Emulating a LTE radio isn't difficult but carrying the S1 interface from the eNB to the EPC is difficult. It's possible to setup a x2 interface to another eNB but you would have to first have access to that eNB through the carrier OSS and if you have OSS access it would be easier to tap the communication somewhere else in the core.

&gt;Q4: What do I need to do to enable  DDIO?  
&gt;  
&gt;A4:  Intel DDIO is enabled by default in all Intel Xeon processor E5-based servers.  

Then lets take a look at who might care... I mean, you don't. But then again - most consumers don't really care about anything beyond 'does it work' and 'does it work faster then the old one?'.

But let's start with a short list of who might care:

* The Washington Post
* Netflix
* CBS
* Dow Jones
* The US government
* City of Barcelona
* NBC news
* Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield
* Youth Employment Service
* American Cancer Society
* Papal

And the kicker is: This is a hit to performance and a slight reduction in power efficiency etc. And that IS a big deal in terms of costs etc for these data centers. And that does, ultimately, effect you.

But hey, it gets better: At this point in time, there is suspect you can exploit DDIO WITHOUT RDMA active - no hard proof, but if the suspicion is there to a sufficient point that it is mentioned at this point, there is good reason to outright disable DDIO.

The real blow to this though, is the lock in tool Intel had to tie it's costomers into using their NIC with their CPU and their chipset is gone.

In short: This is NOT FUD. This is an ugly locomotive of security problems that just keeps on getting longer for Intel.

The source you provided only mentions income, and does not have any information regarding cost of living. If it did, that map would look much different.

Using commercial solutions we would have to fork lift updates every 3 to 5 years.  And moving an exabyte of data would take 3 to 5 years.  And the expense is prohibitive.   

So the storage was designed with what is now a Google Storage node/Back Blaze Pod but with more capacity placed in to a massive 10,000+ node geographically disparate cluster.

Roughly 2 million a PB over multiple agencies.

There will be a crisis when all the data that rests on them needs a place to go.  And then another vendor will lobby.

[],happyscrappy,,,[],,,,text,t2_3dg76,False,[],"&gt; From this conversation I'm beginning to suspect you struggle with the basics of rocket design. I'm trying to help with that, but theres only so much I can say here, pick up a copy of Rocket Propulsion Elements

I don't, thanks. The idea of rocket propulsion is to throw mass out the back rapidly (mv^2 ) to push the rest of the rocket forward. It's why Xenon is used in electric drives for example. And there is a small push to more massive fuels for chemical rockets by some members of the community recently for the same reasons.

[edit: I used methane before. Fixed it.] Methanol's molar mass is only half that of UDMH anyway. And both combustions will incorporate oxygen so I can't see how the combustion products would be higher. So I don't find your answer to be at all explanatory. Do you actually not know the answer? If so, just say so. It's not like you owe me an answer, I just have no use for a wrong one.

If you want to discuss rocketry, get off your high horse and we can discuss it.

&gt;  Standardization matters only at low flightrates ... with several subvariants

We haven't heard of dozens of variants yet. And I also expect that there will be an advantage to one even larger than the largest variant. There always is. And that's why I don't expect any rocket ever to fly will all return to launch pad. Because it doesn't make sense to make a one off design for that one extra large payload.

It would have been real easy for you to say ""yep, I see that"". But instead no, you just go elliptical.

&gt; Implicit in your question was the assumption that a nontrivial number of such payloads need to be launched. If its only 1 or 2 a year out of hundreds of thousands of flights, then its easier for all involved to just land downrange and charge the customer a boatload of money for the inconvenience.

Which is what I said. Thanks. You had to quibble with my comment just to then agree with it. Bizarre.

You mean the chart which also lists per capita CO2 output? I don’t think that is nearly the slam dunk argument you think it is.

&gt;I disagree with the reference’s assessment, b/c it allows the EU to break itself up into parts. If that’s the case, then the US should also be fragmented to avoid counting its actual emissions. 

So you want these to be broken up by countries, yet not when it comes to America because that’s unfair to us because *reasons*? Way to be flagrant with your hypocrisy, my dude.

&gt;But hey, reasonable informed people can disagree without name calling. 

I 100% agree, I’m just not sure what that has to do with me since I haven’t called you any names.

&gt;In any assessment, China and India and Russia have the most centralized industrial sources of pollution. In the US, tailpipe emissions are the largest source. 

Cool.

&gt;Americans don’t have a choice. Rich people have prevented reasonable public transportation for over 100 years. 

I guess I hold myself and other Americans more responsible for their lack of action here than you, but that’s just me.

Because we are purchasing the products they produce without putting enough social or legislative pressure to prevent widespread environmental damage.

From this conversation I'm beginning to suspect you struggle with the basics of rocket design. I'm trying to help with that, but theres only so much I can say here, pick up a copy of Rocket Propulsion Elements 

&gt;Haha. You get done telling me how valuable standardization is and now you say to just build a oneoff to save money! You aren't actually making any sense

1. Standardization matters only at low flightrates. Expendable rockets fly a couple times a year each, its obviously a problem if each is a unique configuration. If each individual variant flies thousands of times a year, then specialization makes sense. I expect dozens of variations of Starship, with different vehicle sizes and payload bay configurations, the same way there are dozens of different passenger aircraft each with several subvariants

2. Implicit in your question was the assumption that a nontrivial number of such payloads need to be launched. If its only 1 or 2 a year out of hundreds of thousands of flights, then its easier for all involved to just land downrange and charge the customer a boatload of money for the inconvenience. But if more than a couple percent of launches require that (or worse, if they require expendability ever), you've sized for the wrong market, and need to build bigger. Whether that means building a specialized variant thats big enough, or moving the entire fleet to a larger class, will depend on market trends and on how flexible the baseline vehicle is

&gt;Having only two stages certainly is a help. It's never made any sense from a rocket equation standpoint before. But maybe it's time now?

F9 is also 2 stages. But F9 S2 is like 20% the mass of the whole stack, vs more like 30% for Starship.

Abstract

Background

Development induces changes in sleep, and its duration has been reported to change as a function of aging. Additionally, sleep timing is a marker of pubertal maturation, where during adolescence, the circadian rhythm shifts later. Typically, this is manifested in a later sleep onset in the evening and later awakening in the morning. These changes across development seem to be universal around the world but are unlikely to persist into adulthood.

Methods

This study utilized accelerometer data from 17,355 participants aged 16–30 years (56% female) measured by validated Polar wearables over a 14-day period. We compared sleep duration, chronotype (sleep midpoint) and weekend catch-up (ie, social jetlag) sleep across ages and regions over 242,948 nights.

Results

The data indicate a decline in sleep duration as well as a dramatic shift in sleep onset times throughout adolescence. This continues well into early adulthood and stabilizes nearer age 30. Differences in sleep duration across ages were significant, and ranged from 7:53 h at age 16 to 7:29 h at age 30 in the sample. Additionally, there was a clear difference between females and males throughout adolescence and young adulthood: girls had longer sleep duration and earlier timed sleep in the current study. Differences in sleep were found between regions across the world, and across European areas.

Conclusions

Both sleep duration and sleep timing go through a clear developmental pattern, particularly in early adulthood. Females had an earlier sleep midpoint and obtained more sleep. Regional differences in sleep occurred across the world.",1569624148,{},f1nr8ys,True,t3_da7qvm,False,True,t3_da7qvm,/r/science/comments/da7qvm/in_a_worldwide_study_on_sleep_nearly_a_quarter_of/f1nr8ys/,1569624149.0,1,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even with that reduced goal post, I think there's lots of reasons to be skeptical about image analysis in healthcare; at least in any hard time frame.  I'll throw out two issues I have:

* Non engineers tend to treat algorithms and machines as objective and mistake-free.  A tool that has better success rates than humans but goes off the rails when mistaken but is treated as absolute and above skepticism could easily lead to worse outcomes.
  * On a related note, Real Life tends to have a lot of tail cases that naturally won't have much training data.  If you are doing machine translation or whatever you can write them off, but for medical diagnosis it needs to intelligently handle them.
* To truly be useful to humans, the tool would need to not just diagnosis x-rays but report why it came up with what it did.  A fundamental weakness of machine learning that I don't think is going to be rescued by deep reasoning or whatever anytime soon.

But a lot just felt like the same pseudo informed rhetoric. And I don't mean not good intentioned but more reactionary to the news of the scientific evidence. What I would like to start hearing more of is list of scientific data. Specifically most reactive climate changing gases listed in order of most damaging to least. And then all of that data tabulated with percentage of global output by category. Then that noted things we can change and things we cannot such as volcanic fumeral output versus global herbivore husbandry.

It's a complicated system, and it's difficult enough to prove the ""why"" for the measurement results we do have. Trying to project those models into the future becomes a debate about how to properly weight the significance of various factors and what factors can be discounted.  There's a ton of room in the system for human judgement and therefore a ton of room for bias and error.  If there wasn't, there wouldn't be competing models. They'd all agree. 

Models on the pessimistic side obviously get the most attention, but I don't think we are being honest about our confidence in those results or the probability of that being the outcome.

“Our research shows that increased environmental awareness and investments in China over the past decade have produced results,” says Chen.

In the late 1970s China’s economy began expanding, and the expansion accelerated during the following decades. Environmental pollution kept pace with economic growth.

“But the analysis of our data shows a weakening of that relationship for China starting in 1995,” Chen says.

They would be negligent if they didn't violate the law that came with a long term fine that was less impactful than the increased profits that the violation created. 

If you want to use market incentives like that, you need to find a way to hit the people making the decisions, which means you need to fine not only the company, but anyone who profited from the running of the company during that period, because the reality is that big shareholders are making the decisions about the company, who the ceo is, who the other executives, and major decisions about the direction of the company and the ethics of it. If you retroactively fuck those guys out of their money, hunt them down in  whatever tax haven they retired to, strip them of their island estate, all their money, drag them back to the US and throw them into section 8 housing, well then you might have some impact on the behavior of executives like that, but it's pretty unlikely, because by a lot of metrics, that guy got away with 30 years of living large and now you're going after him right before he dies, a lot of people would say ""sign me up, i'm gonna die in 20 from all the hookers and blow!""

It's much better to just have accurate reporting about the projected safety issues, track the accuracy of those issues with followups and then decide politically if you want to see the product used, used with restrictions or unused. Labs paid for being accurate would list a host of potential issues, and then the associated rates they expect to see. 1 case of thyroid cancer per 700,000 local residents every decade. 7 cases of increased strokes in 100,000 every year.  1% increase in autism. Whatever their estimations are, plus the margin of error, plus their confidence in the projection. So they say We're expecting this cancer, but we don't have a good idea of the rate, it could be 1 in 1billion, or it could be 1 in 10,000, our confidence in this rate is low, our confidence about the mechanic is high, but it's possible the rate will be statistically undetectable.

That's a conservative but accurate estimation. They will do followups or other labs with different insight, and when they think they can narrow down a claim of rates, they will establish and official projection, and if they are right, they get payouts down the line indefinately, and if they are wrong it hurts their reputation. Bigger the claim, the more is at stake. This means the owners and managers of the lab are all about mitigating long term financial issues and lab prestige, and they will demand explanations and models from the scientists looking for what level of accuracy they can stake their reputation behind, and they will be very interested in what dissenting voices in the lab and in the peer review community might have to say about the potential issues with the methods of estimation.

You have the company produce a thing that they are good at making, a chemical that accomplishes a primary task. Don't fuck with that model. You have a group of people completely separated who have a completely different model for how they make money that selects for responsible generation of results. They will be very worried about missing major dangers, things that cause lots of damage to the environment and people because that's how the impact on their reputation is weighted, and they will be very interested in accurately predicting the issues with a highly useful product because the positive benefits of the product like Glysophate or nuclear power or penicillin are HUGE, so it comes with the potential for very big payouts, and if they come up with accurate estimations of the dangers, and how to mitigate them, and that pans out in the long run, they stand to have a bonus over time that is very significant, and anyone else who develops a new understanding of an additional risk or a better methodology for managing risk that manifests a more significant benefit from the product stands to also get a significant payout. So financials is directly related to benefit, but reputation is about overall accuracy, so having good accuracy on unimportant products is still a very important dynamic for long term success.

On top of this, no one strategy is going to be perfect for running a lab like this. Different leadership and strategic approaches will be more or less successful for various areas of certification, and some will go for a safe strategy and give very conservative estimations and lightly over estimate damages and costs, and they will rarely be penalized, but they might miss out on some big paydays for not supporting some promising but tricky technologies or products, others will be more aggressive and risky in their estimation, but they are still going to be held in check by other profit seeking labs that present a different interpretation of the data or point out critical flaws in methodology, so even an aggressive lab will be diligent about listing issues and the importance of finding mitigation solutions even if they don't have a proposed solution themselves. They can publish a report that says ""this is a great tech, we've solved the issues we've identified with the exception of this one critical danger. Unless this danger is mitigated by some method, we don't fully endorse the use of this product."" Then the rest of the community can see if they can come up with a solution, and if the tech is promising and has the potential for big impact, the payout for that critical issue is big, so there's direct financial incentive for labs to come up with the solutions to the pressing issues that are holding back the biggest advancements, and that's how it should be, but any company that's got a bad reputation for being lazy on small products is going to be iced out of the selection for the promising big ticket work, and the bigger the potential the more labs will apply to be a part of the certification, so everyone want's to get a really solid reputation to weight their lottery access to lucrative testing opportunities.

This leaves the companies free to do what they are actually great at, coming up with chemicals and products and new tech that is really good for humanity when used well, even if they come up with something that is roundly rejected at first, they have the chance to revisit that tech and find solutions to the issues, or they can auction off the rights to the tech and the patents and let another company try to refine it and reapply for certification.

[],Squibbolata,,,[],,,,text,t2_1ctfwr5x,False,,"It is! And no problem, if you have a moment to spare to read a full explanation. I'm a Geneticist who works with big data a lot, and my goodness the spread of ignorance regarding the simple mathematical idea of a comparison-operation permeates all of Academia. And unfortunately it's people like me to blame. I don't have the heart/balls to say to my superiors ""yes, i see it has increased by 2.5x, and that you are very excited by this, but this isn't enough information to get me excited because I still know very little about the nature of this change."" And explaining why is like explaining to a tenured professor basic mathematics. Actually it's exactly like that. So please don't be offended, this is non-obvious even though it sounds incredibly obvious:  


There exists two classes of comparison, absolute differences, and relative differences. Relative differences are more abstract than absolute differences, and can be thought of as a dimensionality reduction of the inputs to be compared. OK real world example:

A=8, B=10

The absolute difference here is 2. However with this information alone I could not tell you what A and B are, and thus the size of any \*relative\* difference. Consider:

""Every day, the Amazon loses another 50,000 trees."" (end-of-day total subtracted from beginning-of-day total)

""OK... is that a lot?""

Versus the following:

""Although the Amazon has 1-billion trees, it's losing 50,000 trees a day!"" (there is an average built-in to this statement, which has an undisclosed time component, but gloss over this)

From this second statement we get a LOT more information. We are told A (before), as well as the absolute difference, and from that we can infer B (1,000,000,000 - 50,000). Now we know A and B in absolute terms, we can perform further relative comparisons if we wanted to.

Now, unlike absolute differences, relative differences use higher mathematical constructs that may have built-in dimensionality reduction.  The reduction is done to ""bring out"" an inner truth from the data, but this almost always ends up hiding the raw absolute values. Note, the actual operator used here can be any function that takes two (or more) inputs and gives an output, but it's almost always either Multiplication or Division. I'll start with division because people are more familiar with that due to percentages. (A1/A2) \*100 is the formula for a percentage. The 100 is a constant and we can actually ignore it, it's unnecessary. It just moves the range of possible results from 0-1 to 0-100. Humans  seem to like that but mathematically speaking it's irrelevant. So A/B = 0.8, B/A = 1.25

Interestingly, if B/A is 1.25 then A/B must be 0.8, and visa versa, and you can know this without even knowing the value of A or B. This is exactly the same as A - B is +2, and you can determine B-A without knowing A or B by flipping the sign. The sign doesn't flip in division, but the values are still symmetric around not 0, but 1, because if A == B then  A-B = 0 whereas A/B = 1. But it's also a bit weirder because 0.8 and 1.25 aren't equidistant from 1. This only occurs because dividing by a number less than 1 (0.8) is mathematically possible but weird things happen, and unfortunately many people exploit this to make their difference seem larger than they really are. (1.25 fold change, 0.25 fold increase, 20% less than before, etc.) There are more ways of expressing the relative change than there are input values. Anyway, the main point is you can determine one from the other without needing to know the values of A and B just as with absolute differences, and like with absolute differences if we don't know a value for A or B, we don't know where on the number line this change is occurring. A might equal 794339066386.4 and B 992923832983, still giving up a relative-difference-pair of 0.8 and 1.25, but the absolute difference is no longer 2.

The upshot of all of this is a hierarchy of information is forming. 1 piece of data is never enough to describe a change. 2 pieces of data might be enough if:

A OR B, plus an absolute OR relative difference, either with respect to A OR B.

OR

An absolute difference AND a relative difference from which we can determine it's symmetric pair's value. (some summary statistics are so complex the pair can not be determined easily, think cryptographic hashes, but they are still always pairs)

OR

A AND B.

Note that A and B lets the reader look at the absolute difference and use any relative statistics they like, and since 2 units of data were required to prevent a dimensionality reduction, you might as well always just provide the raw numbers if possible!!

&amp;#x200B;

I originally furthered this comment with how multiplication is essentially the combining of two inputs much like division except it's mathematically purer because A\*B == B\*A, i.e. it is [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property) much like addition and subtraction (which is really all absolute differences are - the operator chosen is just the most basic operation --- or is it?

Statistically (no opinion presented), and contrary to some hyperbolic assertions from redditors, US doesn't have 3rd world rates of violence. According to NationMaster (data from FBI, CDC), the total violent crime rate for the US is far better than average as well. Here are the top ten (developed) countries by crimes per 1000:

The US crime rate is 29/1000...nowhere near the top ten...or even top 20.

More than 2/3 of America's firearm crime (and homicide) is confined to about 10 densely populated urban areas. If those areas are excluded, America's murder rate drops to about 1/100000 and we beat Germany (a country that would fit entirely into those ten big US cities.) Outside of these dense urban zones, the US is safer than any country on the planet barring perhaps Japan. That is a statistical fact.

What is fascinating (from a research perspective) is that gun laws seem to have very little correlation to crime. Both New Orleans and Detroit have very high violent crime, property crime, and gun crime rates, yet one is extremely restrictive toward firearm ownership and the other quite lax. The laws themselves have proven to have little impact on the crime itself.

The number one statistical correlation between environment and crime is economic, not legal. When many poor people are packed into dense urban centers and forced to compete for resources, we tend to see more crime. A disastrous war on drugs, racist and classist city planning, and some genuinely well-meaning policy choices combined to create a gang culture unique to the United States. With it came the kind of violence that makes these headlines with distressing regularity.

Here's is some more interesting data. Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire have extremely high firearm ownership, yet they are the lowest-crime states in the US. Crime rates in these states are lower than any country on earth. Gun advocates will tell you that it's the gun ownership that makes this so, but the data leans in a different direction. What these states don't have, is population density and rampant poverty.

The three safest states in the US are Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. All three have very lenient firearm laws (two are constitutional carry at the moment). But they are reasonably wealthy, and not very populous (per square mile).

I've seen many conversations about corn on reddit, and no one seems to cite anything other than documentaries.

Here are my thoughts on the topic with actual links.

.........

The only study I’ve every seen posted on Reddit about corn prices and subsidies said no crop insurance (the main subsidy everyone talks about) would raise corn prices by almost 5%.

Here is an [article](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/9009-study-finds-link-between-farm-subsidies-food-prices) on an actual study of corn crop insurance and how it affects the prices of certain foods.

Here is the link to the [study](https://academic.oup.com/aepp/article/39/1/1/2806924)[ ](https://academic.oup.com/aepp/article/39/1/1/2806924)cited and the direct quote: ""The estimates suggest that the removal of the premium of crop insurance would increase corn price by 4.75%.""

Less than 5% That's not a big difference in price, but it does exist, but it's not that simple.

Lots of corn subsidies goes to supporting ethanol, which in turn makes food corn more expensive.

You can see this effect after the 2005 Energy Policy Act and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, when the [price of corn skyrocketed](https://www.macrotrends.net/2532/corn-prices-historical-chart-data), at least partly due to new subsidies for ethanol. 

Corn subsidies are a two way street, it makes producing corn cheaper, but also great drives up demand because of the ethanol requirements.

Now the impact of ethanol subsidies on corn prices have been debated, [some don't think it's that big of deal](https://www.card.iastate.edu/products/policy-briefs/display/?n=1155), or [a huge one](https://www.heritage.org/environment/report/renewable-fuel-standard-ethanol-use-and-corn-prices#_ftn8), but everyone seems to agrees it does increase the price of corn.

So, in the end, it's hard for me to blame corn subsidies for the super low price of HFCS or the ubiquitous use of it. 

Corn is an amazing plant ( with its C4 carbon fixation) that is perfectly suited to modern agriculture. [C4 carbon fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation) (wiki link) is so cool that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided 14 million to put it in rice. Corn deserves a real conversation about it, not only repeating hearsay.

Most astrophysicists will actually tell you that they believe that the models used to calculate the distances to those supernova are flawed in some way. There are known errors that affect the measurements such as cosmic dust, making them look further away, and crowding by other stars making them look closer due to brightening, in addition to more complex sources of error, such as metallicity. Different models treat these errors differently and thus give different results. The high sigma reading on all these models doesn't mean they're correct, it merely means that the model used to correct for the errors produces consistent, tightly bound data, that doesn't mean they're correct.

The big problem with the supernova data is that it used cepheid variables to calibrate its ladder, which are found in hot, crowded, dusty centers of galaxies. There are a lot of sources of errors that may not be easily corrected. Other teams try to avoid this by looking at stars on the outskirts of galaxies where there are a lot fewer sources of errors.

Evaluating Big Five, according to your reply, the number is based on a scree plot. [Scree plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scree_plot) do make intuitive sense, but they are susceptible to fudging, because there's no ""one right way"" to select the cutoff, and real-world data doesn't even have a clean level-off. So it's a fudge factor; a relatively good one, but nonetheless.

A factor analysis task is done by fitting a loading matrix on some set of scores/questions. Reading up on factor analysis (just from Wikipedia), the cutoff for a loading factor is 0.7:

With four, I'd imagine it simply was that you could extract a fifth factor that clearly seems coherent. Six factor models are comparatively new, but from reading some of Ashton &amp; Lee's HEXACO material I was left with the impression that their factors just don't seem as clean and amenable to a ""lever on a biological mechanism"" type of explanation as the Big Five are. Saucier's work on a six factor model did have him recommending a model I think would be intrigued to see more research on.

I think you misunderstood that, and what I was saying. I was just saying that when you analyze personality items, you tend to get a handful of usually coherent factors out of the factor analysis process. Same with general intelligence - you give people a bunch of items, the *g* factor rises from the data more or less spontaneously when subjected to factor analysis. It's why the FFM ended up being ""found"" by multiple researchers separately. They had different instruments and presumably different analytical procedures, but ended up finding something roughly similar to each other. 

EI, insofar as I can tell (and I need to repeat I'm not anywhere near as well-read on EI as I am on personality and general intelligence, fixing that is a future project) moreso born from the human observation that it's a construct that makes sense (and some dose of wanting to dethrone general intelligence as the ""king"" of the intelligence hierarchy, it's a concept some people just find insufferable for some reason), so people started building measures and ability tests to measure it and found that they did actually measure something.

The trouble is, measuring something and that something being clearly meaningful as EI is doesn't guarantee the construct itself is ""pure"" or an independent phenomenon rather than something humans built by their own decision.

This is the thing I’m working on at the moment and you’re right. My goal is to push the use of standardized methodologies so that we could develop some sort of accountability amongst archaeologists. We have no expectation to publish data and make it available to other archaeologists to check the validity of the claim. I’m not arguing for a specific methodology but more that the methodological approaches be systematic and replicable in a way that other archaeologists can say “hey this guy’s methodology left out ABC and left us with bad data”. 

There’s really no accountability which leads us to have massively variable data resulting in a diminished ability to produce any real large scale analysis without putting in tons of money, time, and elbow grease into making other people’s data fit. That’s if they even give out the data. 

I think if we started to push for standardized methodologies, more accountability, and a general change in attitude towards standardization we could start pushing into the major problems of reproducibility and replicability in archaeology.

Yes, as opposed to fiber optics used today. The latter half of that quote literally states: ""and be orders of magnitude higher.""

&gt; Classical mechanics is a lot simpler than quantum mechanics though.

I think you mean easier to understand. That's not the same as complexity. Complexity refers to the number of moving parts. 

&gt; And you're conflating computer components with universe components. Just because you're working at the atomic level, doesn't mean your computer components are small and indivisible.

... this is a really dumb statement for a number of reasons. One, people don't work on the atomic level. We're not quantum. Two, you just presented a dichotomy between computer science and physics. Everything is made of atoms, no exception. There's a bottom up explaination for everything. And Three, that's literally why its called quantum computing. In order to reduce those bits to their smallest quantum components. If you don't understand this then why are you responding to me? We're clearly not talking about the same thing, and I'm starting to wonder what you're even doing here at all. 

&gt; A qubit requires a lot more working compoments than a regular bit. 

A qbit is an entangled particle. It requires 2 particles. You're referring to the mechanics of a quantum computer, not the complexity of the data. We already discussed this. 

""It doesn't matter that the equipment is more complex. We're not talking about equipment, we're talking about data. And the signal is still cleaner, faster and has fewer errors because of how few working components it has. Which is where your bandwidth and bulk processing advantages come from.""

You're the one conflating complexity with engineering. That's the same thing as claiming that a cake is healthier because more people worked on it. That's unrelated. Your problem here is terminology, and you're not using it properly. I'm using the term complexity form an information theory standpoint. Not to mean big and hard to understand. 

&gt; In terms of real computing, data has to exist on equipment and be processed by equipment.

Doesn't change the complexity of the signal. Radio transmitters can come as towers or cell phone receivers that fit in your pocket. They still produce a comparable quality signal. Again, this is just a semantic argument because you don't like the terms being used. This is how a theist or a con artist argues, but redefining semantics because they were offended. 

&gt; No. You won't get higher bandwidth of traditional binary data. Simple calculations aren't faster. Only specific complex ones. 

Yes you do get faster bandwidth, orders of magnitude faster due to the explanation I gave earlier. Entangled particles produce virtually zero noise. You know an electric current interferes with itself, right? There's a noise threshold below which you can't discern 1s or 0s. 

&gt; The probability states of superpositions are a lot less ""clean"" than a binary voltage state. 

No. For the reason I just stated above. 

&gt; It's not faster, it still travels at the speed of light.

No. Now your conflating fiberoptics with quantum computing. Neither quantum computers nor classical computers operate at light speed. But quantum computers *can* get a hell of a lot closer. This breaks down to the speed of discharge from the slowest working components, transistors. And my noise explanation applies here. The more noise, the stronger signal you need to produce, which takes more time. This is *why* a cleaner signal is faster. 

&gt; Because what you said is wildly off the mark with regards to quantum computer and quantum networking (which uses are basically transferring quantum specific data and high security)

Okay. Then prove something. Support any claim you made. You didn't. I'm not the one that's bullshitting here. You're just naysaying, and reframing semantics, because you feel irked. That's it. You haven't reasoned anything. And now that I have a few posts of experience with you, I don't expect you to anymore either. 

I'm confident that you're not smart enough to learn from your mistakes, and especially considering you rehashed the same sub-intellectual problems even after I explained them to you, so you're blocked. I made my points and you're too obtuse to understand them. You're not worth any more of my time. 

&gt; TLDR quantum computers suck at being regular computers. Quantum computers are better a specific algorithms, which help in specific fields like encryption breaking or simulating quantum systems.

I am going to argue that social media is not necessarily a stress accelerator but that ad driven models run by share holders benefit from incentives which create comparitively less valuable results.

**Assymetric Information Distribution:** Using social media sites generates more data per hour than we all the information on human behavior we had before 1950. It's a lot. A great deal is known about human behavior.

Those data and the information which can be derived from it are sold to companies in order to further influence behavior. The information, like anything else, has more relative value if,

* fewer people have access to it (supply and demand),

* it can be distributed in a way that offers benefits to the user (the user is the company and the platform, not human beings generating data).

If everyone had easy access to the data we are generating, it would be more difficult to influence our behavior. It is valuable to companies to influence our behavior (specifically our purchasing behavior but our purchasing behavior relies on our perceptions of the world and several other behaviors and so a wise company would seek to influence a suite of behaviors and perceptions). 

Companies will make more money the more time human beings spend on social media, generating data and having perceptions and behaviors nudged. Maybe in big ways of exposing humans to radical viewpoints, mind blowing breakthroughs, or impossible beauty; maybe in little ways of encouraging a little more antagonism, cynicism, and tribalism (in the words of Tracy Jordan, ""it's not worth nothing"", little efforts lead to big results).

If data generating humans were aware of the broader picture of their behaviors, they would have an easier time choosing their own paths which would make those selling the information have a harder time because the information would be less valuable.

Whether it is possible for humans to connect with one another in a way that does not generate addictive behaviors and other indicators of poor health is under-explored territory. Whether such a platform could exist in competition with the addictive, data mining systems that we now experience, is not something I am certain of.

&gt;""The GFD continues to trend in popular culture and the media, and more people are restricting gluten from their diet. The medical community must seek to provide an evidence-based approach delineating both the benefits and potential harms of a GFD. Although convincing evidence is available to support the benefits of a GFD for certain patient populations without a gluten-related disease (especially patients with IBS and NCGS), the data are conflicting and not definitive. It appears that most individuals who participate in a GFD do not have a physiologic requirement for the diet and likely do not derive substantial benefit. Existing evidence for potential harms of a GFD include possible nutritional deficiencies, financial costs, and negative psychosocial implications. As with other dietary interventions, a GFD is a rapidly evolving topic, and additional insight is needed to guide a complete discussion between patients considering a GFD and their health care providers.""

I could just be missing something and I generally just glanced at the sources to try and find the relevant claim or data to back the claim. I also read introductions summaries and analysis'. But these claims seem to be sensationalized a bit from their source or even stretched a bit to make a broader claim then was being made by the source. 

&gt; The surge in gluten-free popularity has also encouraged an opposing belief that it is a “fad” diet.

Checked the source it does not look like it makes this claim. I could've have missed it but I didn't see the article making such a claim. It did speak of the popularity amongst celebrities which linked to a daily mail article which cited 3 celebrities and another article which spoke of the popularity amongst athletes which had some actual statistically data to back it. But nothing that states that it's causing an opposite reaction to think that it's a ""fad"". 

&gt; This is unfortunate for people with CD/NCGS, who express that they are not taken seriously in restaurants, and even face dismissive attitudes from nonspecialist clinicians.

I can't find any data to really back this claim in the source but it may be from:

[from the cited article]
&gt; In a New York restaurant, a celiac patient requesting a gluten-free menu was asked by the server if the diet was for health or for lifestyle. This increasingly common exchange exemplifies the clinical conundrum clinicians face regarding the use of a gluten-free diet (GFD).

Here it speaks of *a* New York. Then states it's becoming increasingly popular, without any citation. So as far as I can tell this is purely anecdotal or speculatory as there's no data collected on this statement. Or rather there is no cited data. 

Now maybe I'm just a big dumb idiot who doesn't know how to do statistical analysis or maybe I just can't read but I feel like this study is reaching a bit ( a lot) here. It's still a study and it has some merit and when collected with other small studies could be significant but I feel like it's trying to make itself out to be more important than it is. And it's making grandiose generalizations of its sources at best.

I started looking for your survey, and what I first bumped into[1] mentions:

&gt; In 2007-11, less than 1% of victims in all nonfatal violent crimes reported using a firearm to defend themselves during the incident.

Some early numbers based on this research suggest, and is commonly touted, that you're unlikely to ever use it for personal defense. Furthermore, as is being shown in these studies, they're _terribly self reported_ and very likely inaccurate. Both the ""defender"" and invader have odd incentives for reporting. Making it difficult to account for any sanity in a discussion.

I know gun owners love to dream of defending their home by a weapon that is locked away and safely disarmed, but the reality is they're more likely to harm someone they love via accidental fire or commit suicide than use it. At least, according to the data. Gun ownership for home defense seems about as likely as cooking utensils for home defense.

So yea, I guess guns are used for a lot more than survival. Domestic violence and suicide are big ones.

[],G_o_o_d_n_a_s_t_y,,,[],,,,text,t2_w95qi,False,,"OK now I've had a chance to skim the study. A few notes worth considering in interpreting the results:

* They didn't measure telomere length directly. Instead they looked at the ratio of telomere DNA to the amount of DNA from a single gene copy, so what's being measured is the total amount of telomere to the total amount of a given gene. This is based on DNA, so it shouldn't fluctuate with gene expression, but at the same time they didn't specify which gene they used as a comparison and that's a big omission (I also looked in supplemental materials). Notably, the method they reference can be found [here](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/116/11/1899.long?sso-checked=true), which is a study on telomere crises in leukemia and specifically benchmarks well-defined telomeric motifs.
* They didn't assay telomerase activity or leukocyte proliferation, both of which could influence the results of their assay (e.g., a leukocyte in G2 is going to have more of the control gene and more telomeres in general, but not necessarily in a linear doubling relationship--although note that canonically leukocytes don't proliferate while in circulation, it's just something that can't be ruled out). I would have really liked to see some telomerase activity data here, it would provide another metric of whether or not the loving-kindness meditation (LKM) had an effect.
* Given that they were collecting peripheral blood, it strikes me as a serious lack of creativity that they did also grab a comprehensive metabolic panel, cytokine array, or even isolate leukocytes and test their *in vitro* reactivity,. This info would have provided much better insight into whether LKM had an effect on inflammation in general and it's omission is kind of surprising given how much they talk about stress reduction and the endocrinology of positive emotions in the background and discussion sections. However, this is a complaint coming from someone who primarily works in immunology, so while it is obvious to me it may be much less obvious to them, especially considering how many of their other endpoints are psycho-social and basic clinical parameters.
* They compared loving-kindness meditation (LKM) to mindfulness meditation (MM) **and** a negative control, which is important and good to have included. They did not, however, take any data on exercise or diet habits that could have also had an influence on their results.
* Their top-line finding is basically that LKM subjects had less telomere shortening than subjects for MM or negative control, **but** their controls are slightly whack. This doesn't necessarily mean that their results are garbage that should be thrown away, but they observed a substantially greater rate change in telomere length over 6 weeks in *all subjects* [when compared to studies of telomere length change over comparable time period](https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S1568163713000044)s, which found much slower rates of telomere change regardless of intervention or background. Maybe there's a local effect given that they were only dealing with people from North Carolina, maybe its an artifact of the telomere length assay, maybe its even down to differences in the consumables used in this study. Can't tell which without follow-on study.
* There is an observed dose-dependence in terms of meditation length that is in accordance with other studies on meditation finding a similar dose-dependency, but this is a weak effect that could be explained by differences in participants who were willing to meditate more or even down to the instructor's methods.
* There's a good attempt to exclude co-variates that could impact analysis and test for the overall effect in patients regardless of background characteristics, but this is a bit roughshod in terms of execution (testing the influence of each parameter using a hazard ratio approach could have given clearer results than the chi-squared method they employed) **and** they specifically note that they did not recruit enough participants to meet their own projections for adequate statistical power, which was set at only 0.80 (roughly 80% chance that the results observed are true). They also omit their predicted error *and* they did the power analysis, and all of this analysis, after data collection was already done instead of prospectively, which invites retrospective bias and is generally regarded as best-avoided.

Overall, even though this isn't my field, I'm annoyed enough by the inconsistencies in study design and analysis that--had I been one of the reviewers on this paper--I'd have demanded that they re-analyze all their data and (if they have any samples banked) include additional endpoints before recommending this paper for publication.

Is it up to the tax payers to now fund their welfare because those chose to get a degree that won't get them a job that can pay them enough to live on their own without food stamps or any welfare? I get it, yes trying to educate people is a good thing, and pursing that could potentially reduce taxpayer costs but not if folks are getting degrees in something that has no relevant job in the market.

I never said to bar someone from getting an education. I agree, access to getting an education is a right. You have a right to go learn, sure.

I'm in favor of education by any means other than taking my hard earned money to fund it. You and I agree, education is a right as far as having access to go get it and choosing to get one. And the constitution would up hold that actually but FREE (really paid by taxpayers) education? No that isn't promised by the constitution and it isn't a right to have that. If you want to go out and get one and fund it however you want, by all means go ahead. I'd encourage it.

How the hell are you needing 50k for school? Live at home, get a job, commute to school if you can or find a cheap apartment but it shouldn't cost you 50k to go to school. I remember hearing people taking out 30k loans for one year at a time. I was blown away because I was at the SAME college and living at home and it cost me like 3k a semester.

I went to a local community college first then transferred over to the big university. Saved a TON. Alright off topic lol. 

Also, this moved over to higher education argument I feel like, but back to my other point, the property tax to pay for education is something when/if I have kids some day I could opt out and use that as a means to fund my kid going to a private school.

Yep you guessed it, now that wheel tax is there to fund the county sheriff pension fund. Has nothing to do with education now.

Same. I'm extremely skeptical of alcoholism ""cures"" and especially skeptical whenever alcoholism is said to be caused by trauma. People become alcoholics, and recover from it, at very different ""bottoms"" - some people had picture perfect lives and ""merely"" broke up with a SO, while others were abused their entire lives. 

Alcoholism, imo, isn't about trauma, it's about inadequate methods and tools for dealing with trauma, or emotions in general. This also accounts for the genetic component to alcoholism: it's much more likely that your parent passed down a trait determining your inadequate methods for dealing with the garbage life throws at your than a predilection for, say, GHB. 

My father was an alcoholic, as was his father before him. I'm a recovering heroin addict. Did my father happen to have a gene for heroin addiction, too? Or is the gene about how to approach life, rather than how the body responds to certain chemicals.

Also: it's worth noting that recovery from addiction is a sliding scale. Any amount of recovery is a big deal, and it's true that most people relapse. So what is success? I've been clean and sober for 15 years. That's successful, right? But I tried half heartedly a few times before I got it for good, I spent my early 20s in and out of meetings, on and off of drugs. So was I a failure? 

I used to go to AA all the time, I did the steps, I had a sponsor and sponsees, but now i don't. I'm no longer as serene as I was when I was going to meetings a lot. Have I failed? 

The fact is, most people who go to AA don't stay sober. But I've still seen more people get sober - and some even stay sober - through AA than any other method. Does that mean AA is the only way? Of course not.

Long term data is hard to come by, and hard to trust, since their are so many confounding factors. But I hope this research helps. There are a lot of people that AA isn't working for, and they still need help.  But honestly, I think the real issue is, we don't know shit about addiction and recovery.

[],mutatron,,physics,[],,BS | Physics,dark,text,t2_x5g2,False,,"That's not what consensus means in this case. Understanding the climate depends on a mix of theory and statistics.

The theory has been around for over 100 years, [when Svante Arrhenius looked into it](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/leading-figures/svante-arrhenius-the-man-who-foresaw-climate-change/):

&gt; One of the problems then in vogue in the scientific community that especially caught his interest was to find the cause of the different glaciations that the planet had gone through throughout its history. Arrhenius wanted to find out if the determining factor for these climatic events could be the concentration of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere. John Tyndall had already focused on this, identifying methane, water vapour and CO2 as atmospheric gases that cause the greenhouse effect.

&gt; In 1895 Arrhenius wanted to quantify this influence of CO2 on the greenhouse effect, which involved doing endless, complex and tedious calculations by hand—an activity that, apparently, served as a therapy to help him overcome his separation from his first wife. The results he obtained finally came to light in an article published in 1896. In it, Arrhenius concluded that a reduction in the atmospheric CO2 levels to half the then existing ones would result in a drop in the temperature of the planet of between 4 and 5°C, which could lead to a massive cooling like the one that takes place during glaciations.

&gt; But he also warned that if those same levels increased by 50%, the planet would experience a warming of between 5 and 6°C, which, as Arrhenius pointed out, meant, among other things, that Scandinavia would enjoy a more benign and pleasant climate. In addition, the article also identified human industrial activity as the main source of new CO2 into the atmosphere. Although he estimated that, at the rate of emissions at that moment, this concentration would take about 3,000 years to reach, we now know that this forecast was very moderate and optimistic.

So that's the basic theory people have been working off of, but the climate is complex, so there are a lot of other theories that go into trying to predict climate. Since we don't have another Earth to experiment with, we have to gather data on changes that have already happened and put them into computer models. The models make predictions of changes that happened in the past, and we compare that to what really happened.

People also do [measurements of current climate parameters](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2015/02/25/co2-greenhouse-effect-increase/):

&gt; First Direct Observation of Carbon Dioxide’s Increasing Greenhouse Effect at the Earth’s Surface: Berkeley Lab researchers link rising CO2 levels from fossil fuels to an upward trend in radiative forcing at two locations

&gt; “Numerous studies show rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but our study provides the critical link between those concentrations and the addition of energy to the system, or the greenhouse effect,” Feldman adds.

Because it's such a big, complex problem, there's no way to get multi-digit precision like there is with something like gravity or quantum chromodynamics, and so that's where the idea of a ""consensus"" comes in. But really since that study was made, the certainty of man-made global warming has gone beyond consensus.

[A probabilistic analysis of human influence on recent record global mean temperature changes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096314000163?via%3Dihub)

&gt; The results of our statistical analysis would suggest that it is highly likely (99.999 percent) that the 304 consecutive months of anomalously warm global temperatures to June 2010 is directly attributable to the accumulation of global greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The corollary is that it is extremely unlikely (0.001 percent) that the observed anomalous warming is not associated with anthropogenic GHG emissions. Solar radiation was found to be an insignificant contributor to global warming over the last century, which is consistent with the earlier findings of Allen et al. (2000).

Scientists are always measuring and remeasuring, looking for reasons for the current episode of climate change besides humans burning 3.5 cubic miles of oil equivalent.

[],johnslegers,,,[],,,,text,t2_eqxgl,False,,"&gt;In the scientific circles I mix in, there is an overwhelming scepticism about human-induced climate change. Many of my colleagues claim that the mantra of human-induced global warming is the biggest scientific fraud of all time and future generations will pay dearly.  
&gt;  
&gt;If 97 per cent of scientists agree that there is human-induced climate change, you’d think they would be busting a gut to vanquish climate sceptics in public debates. Instead, many scientists and activists are expressing confected outrage at the possibility of public debates because the science is settled. After all, 97 per cent of scientists agree that human emissions drive global warming and there is no need for further discussion.  
&gt;  
&gt;In my 50-year scientific career, I have never seen a hypothesis where 97 per cent of scientists agree. At any scientific conference there are collections of argumentative sods who don’t agree about anything, argue about data, how data was collected and the conclusions derived from data. Scepticism underpins all science, science is underpinned by repeatable validated evidence and scientific conclusions are not based on a show of hands, consensus, politics or feelings. Scientists, just like lawyers, bankers, unionists, politicians and those in all other fields, can make no claim to being honest or honourable, and various warring cliques of scientists have their leaders, followers, outsiders and enemies. Scientists differ from many in the community because they are allegedly trained to be independent. Unless, of course, whacking big research grants for climate “science” are waved in front of them.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 97 per cent figure derives from a survey sent to 10,257 people with a self-interest in human-induced global warming who published “science” supported by taxpayer-funded research grants. Replies from 3146 respondents were whittled down to 77 self-appointed climate “scientists” of whom 75 were judged to agree that human-induced warming was taking place. The 97 per cent figure derives from a tribe with only 75 members. What were the criteria for rejecting 3069 respondents? There was no mention that 75 out of 3146 is 2.38 per cent. We did not hear that 2.38 per cent of climate scientists with a self-interest agreed that humans have played a significant role in changing climate and that they are recipients of some of the billions spent annually on climate research.

[],SharkNoises,,,[],,,,text,t2_mvc3q,False,,"Tl;dr the thing you're pointing out isn't actually that big a deal, since the solution to that problem has to be applied to nuclear as well. The complaint you have becomes more minor by the year, but the drawbaks of nuclear will take much longer to mitigate if it's even possible to mitigate them. This data showing how cost effective, easy to roll out and environmentally beneficial wind and solar comes from the real world, not some vague 'but it has drawbacks!'

Nuclear is super strictly regulated, meaning it has lower margins than wind or solar. There's a lot of public sentiment against it, meaning that planning and building a nuclear plant is a logistical nightmare. In practice, it's a risky investment with a high upfront cost  (many, many millions) and a huge (30+ years, minimum) lead time for any return on investment , meaning that it's a risky and unappealing business venture. Contrast that to renewables, which are easier to get approval for, easier to get funding for, take less time to pay themselves off and can be installed at any scale.

On top of that, wind and solar start to work IMMEDIATELY as soon as wind blows or the sun shines. Obviously they can't provide power all the time, but with proper battery storage they can meet a lot of demand for power with a lot of flexibility, making them even more appealing. For example, peaker plants can be used to supply the rest of the power. Because conditions that require the use of supplemental power are predictable, the drawbacks of changing weather can be mitigated.

Contrast that with nuclear, which pretty much needs to be running full tilt constantly or else it's losing money. Nuclear reactors take a long time to cool down and start back up. Because of this nuclear can never be cost efficient for providing more than 20-30% of demand by the nature of the technology. Ever. With efficient and cheap enough batteries, it might actually be possible to power some regions entirely with wind or solar in 20-30 years. Nuclear won't get there EVER. You HAVE to use other power sources to meet demand, such as peaker plants.

If it actually exceeded *c*, it would be an absolute revolution in physics, on the order of Einstein's supersession of Newton, or Darwin's supersession of Laplace.

As somebody else put it beautifully, the speed of light through a vacuum is 186K miles per second. The speed of light through water is 75% of that. Water and vacuum are the different media (with due caveats concerning whether the vacuum is a medium). Cherenkov radiation exceeds the 75%, but it doesn't exceed 100%, and the same is true here (with different values). These GRBs exceed *x*% of *c*, where *x%* is the speed attainable by light in that medium. They can never exceed x&gt;100%.

In other words, and this is simplified, the term 'speed of light' is a popsci term that is leading people down the garden path.

*c* is a number. It's the maximum magnitude of a vector whose travel is restricted to space. It has nothing to do with light, other than that light is one of the things whose motion is apposite to the subject.

[],Capn_Mission,,,[],,,,text,t2_8l4aa,False,[],"&gt;Metal is the closest of all contemporary genres to classical music.

While the above isn't a sentence I would ever type out in a public forum, I suppose one could argue for the truth of that statement by focusing on complex metal subgenres (e.g. prog metal, death metal) while ignoring the less complex metal subgenres (e.g. metalcore, sludge/doom metal, thrash). 

One could compare the complexity of prog metal to the more complex examples of formal western music. One could also symponic metal to the music of the romantic composers.

That being said, there is a level of subtlety in most western formal music that is completely lacking in metal. Even ""Bach rockers"" like Yngwie Malmsteen seem to have zero interest in the subtle aspects of classical music. While a sheet music transcription of Yngwie's music might look quite similar to that of sheet music of the baroque era, his approach to playing those notes is as far from classical as you can get.

What other contemporary genres (let's assume the commenter above was limiting those to things like soul, country, hip hop, rock, pop, etc.) are more like classical than metal? I suppose prog rock is probably just as much like classical as certain metal subgenres. Some ""new age"" artists also have similarities with some forms of classical music. Some of Yanni's music has similarities with romantic compositions. Ludovico Einaudi could also be compared with classical music.

There are number of classical guitar players that create music that is quite reminiscent of the baroque style. However, the commenter above may not have been familiar with those artists.

Popular orchestral music from film scores (think John Williams) is probably closer to classical music than metal is to classical music.

Finally, the late tango songwriter and bandoneon performer, Astor Piazzolla made music that is closer to classical music than most metal is to classical music",1569798070,{},f1xgp0a,False,t3_db0y25,False,True,t1_f1xd0oi,/r/science/comments/db0y25/rebellious_music_genres_such_as_rap_punk_and/f1xgp0a/,1569808459.0,4,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also resonates with people as while many genres are designed to distract from thoughts and lift us up, metal tends to explore/incorporate our Jungian shadow. We all either do or should acknowledge that, we have dark thoughts, impulses or ideas periodically which we lock away but this means it still exists. Metal dives into this and makes you look your shadow in the eye and see yourself for who you are, which is essential for personal growth and incorporating your shadow in a healthy way.",1569797779,{},f1xfvqk,False,t3_db0y25,False,True,t1_f1xd0oi,/r/science/comments/db0y25/rebellious_music_genres_such_as_rap_punk_and/f1xfvqk/,1569808052.0,3,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Western Hemisphere, much of the information regarding endangered species is compiled by an organization called [NatureServe](https://www.natureserve.org/).  The data acquired by NatureServe is provided by various scientific member organizations who collect data in the field and input it into a common system shared with all of the other organizations.  In the United States, often these organizations are part of State government or The Nature Conservancy.

Since many organizations operate at a State Level, the existence of a species is often tracked two ways, Globally (called a G-Rank) and State (called an S-Rank).  The Global Ranking of a species is determined by compiling data from across the network, then assigning a rank based on certain criteria (generally number of individual populations of a specific species).  The fewer number of populations, the more rare it is - and the more likely it is to go extinct, this is true for both the Global and State ranking.

Given the rarity, scientists who monitor these things, go back and look for these populations on a regular basis to see if they still exist, see if the population has grown, see if it's shrunk, etc.  That data is then reported back and the status is reassessed.

It's not realistic to mandate it, but it IS a realistic step a journal can take to increase trust and methodological rigour on all sides. Can you trust a journal more if you can see EVERYTHING?

Hmm.

One of the definitions of bullying is that there is a power asymmetry - it's punching down. So when I see full professors at fancy universities squealing about how a foreign post-doc with a tenuous job at an obscure university is being a big old bully by questioning their work, it's REALLY hard to take that seriously.

Systems are big, and change slowly and unpredictably. There WILL be hurt feelings, misunderstandings, and anything even revolutionary-flavoured will attract extreme personalities.

I'm a fan of statistics. Isn't it more likely that we are living in one of an infinity number of continuing universes that end in a big crunch and restart with a big bang, than living in the one and only first and last universe that ends in endless expansion?

If you open a program the CPU will load the files and data it is using into the RAM because the RAM is a lot faster to access than the Hard Disk. 

""A typical DRAM has a transfer rate of approximately 2-20GB/s, whereas typical SSDs have a transfer rate of 50MB-200MB/s. So it's one to two orders of magnitude slower""[1]

So if you install a faster RAM, the CPU can load things a little bit faster but you won't notice it that much in comparison to the fact that if you install more RAM and the CPU can temporarily save more it doesn't have to swap out the files that often leading to faster performance. 

For example you have two big programs running. Using one (program 1) and one running in the background (program 2). So the one program you are using is fully loaded into the RAM. With the data and files using all space of your RAM. You switch from your current program to the other program, so the CPU has to load all the not saved data of program 1 on the hard disk. Loading the files and data from program 2 onto the RAM and overwriting all data currently stored on the RAM. This swap is limited by the speed of your hard disk which is much slower than the RAM. This is why switching a program can take a little bit of time.

""Inflation"" and ""expansion"", despite being synonyms in English, are not actually the same thing in the lingo of cosmology. Expansion is the expansion of space that underpins Big Bang cosmology. Inflation refers to a specific epoch of expansion that is hypothesized to have happen in the first fractions of a fraction of a second after the Big Bang where the universe expanded in a very specific way (exponentially) driven by a quantum field (often called the ""inflaton field""). 

Secondly, in the balloon analogy, we're not *in* the balloon but rather one of the dots on the surface. Big Bang cosmology is all about the geometry of space and how it, and distances within that space, change in time and the point of the balloon analogy is to invoke an intuition of geometric structure changing in time by exploiting the everyday intuition of having a 2D object embedded in a 3D space. It is not an aspect of Big Bang cosmology that geometric expansion is tied to being embedded in a higher dimensional space, but such a conceptual trick does resonate very well with our fleshy, squishy little ape brains. Thus the utility of the analogy.

However, you are definitely on to something.  *One* of the key aspects of Big Bang cosmology is that the universe is expanding and thus any and all points in the universe are getting further apart and thus us, on Earth, see all distant points with an inherent recessional velocity (i.e. a velocity away from us) and that velocity getting greater, with a clear mathematical relationship, the farther away they are. There are then two conclusions to be made based on that data alone, either the universe is expanding, or we're somewhere special and everything is moving away from us. Maybe we have bad breath. Both equally fit that data.  However, that isn't the only evidence we have for the former, in fact it's arguably not even the most compelling. The fact that at all points in the sky we see a distinctive type of light, called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (the CMB) with a certain distinctive distribution (what's called Planck's Law), is exactly in line with the first picture but not the second. Furthermore, we have the relative abundances of the chemical elements and the time-dependence of the fundamental scale of ""clumpiness"" of things in the universe. Both fall not just qualitatively but quantitatively in line with the notion of Big Bang cosmology, and would have no explanation in the theory of ""we're in a special spot and have bad breath so everything is moving away from us, the further away the faster they're leaving... for reasons"".",1567947671,{},ezjodt0,False,t3_d0r8z8,False,True,t3_d0r8z8,/r/askscience/comments/d0r8z8/how_do_we_know_that_the_universe_is_expanding/ezjodt0/,1567947682.0,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deniers consist of people who are more skeptical when presented with new information.  They tend to be more stubborn, changing their ways relatively slowly.

[],SpectacularOcelot,,,[],,,,text,t2_jqjrf,False,,"Howdy, I undertake some pretty large construction projects for my job so I think I can answer this pretty well. The answers are ""Compartmentalization"" and ""Specialization"". A whole lot of people with specialized, widely applicable knowledge come together to build something very specific.

There is no degree in ""Subway Construction"" or ""Stadium Construction"" or ""Electrical Substation Construction"". And no one person is going to be an expert in the huge variety of things you need expertise on to make those projects successful.

Lets say you want to build a subway, so you hire a company that says they can do that. Well, chances are that company doesn't have all the expertise internal to it to make this happen, so they go out to an army of subcontractors. A few I can guess off the top of my head:

* A geotechnical engineer. These guys will take soil borings to tell you what kind of dirt (or rock, or water, or oil&amp;gas pockets) you're dealing with. This is a pretty old industry, and isn't specific to subways. These guys don't really care what you're planning, they're just going to give you data.
* A mining/excavation engineer. Mines move \*lots\* of dirt, and there's always one expanding/starting/closing. The mining industry has the expertise in it \*somewhere\* to help you put together a dig plan, and choose the equipment you'll need to dig a tunnel big enough for a subway. Again, they don't much care that you're building, but they can help you move enough dirt to build it there.
* A civil engineer. These guys are going to help you with concerete mix designs, reinforcing your new tunnel, dealing with any underground water you find, etc. (This might overlap with the mining engineer, not my field so who does what is up for someone else to fill in).
* A train manufacturer. Most of the time equipment manufacturers are more than happy to look at your designs and make suggestions. What kind of train works best for this tunnel? What gauge of tracks is common in this part of the world? How fast should the train be built for? You'll want these guys at the table when you're talking to the excavation guys so you don't have bends that are too sharp.
* HVAC guys. Tunnels have needed access to open air for time immemorial. Not to mention, no one will want to ride your subway if its 35C down there.
* Electricians. Subways take a LOT of juice. Enough that you'll have to work with the local power company to feed it.
* Steel workers. Piles and piles of steel are going to be involved in this project, basically anywhere you can think of.
* Fire/emergency services. What happens if you have a train break down between stations? A fire on that train between stations? You want fire fighters, again probably guys that have worked near mines, to help here. It doesn't really matter this is  a subway. Its a bunch of people in an enclosed space, similar to the utility space below a stadium, or skyscraper. This is widely applicable knowledge that someone around the world has.

And these are just the subject matter experts, that don't really care what exactly you're building (aside from the train guys). You'll still want a project manager, someone to handle materials, someone to do accounts payable, and on and on and on.

No single individual I've mentioned can do the entire thing. At this scale the owner/general contractor that builds this really only accumulates lists of subcontractors for specific scopes. 

The other side of this that I haven't really touched on is an engineering perspective. There are a few manufacturers of subway cars around the world, and they churn them out pretty regularly to replace or maintain existing systems. Those guys can tell you how much energy you need, you have an electrical engineer design your electric system to supply that need, you give those plans to an electrical contractor who has built systems to deliver that much power before, he hires guys that know how to pull wire and so on.

* **Measurement of angles:** the [radian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian) is an SI-derived unit for measuring angles, that is effectively based on 𝛑 (one full circle is an angle of 2𝛑).  Polar coordinates in the complex plain often have their angles specified in radians, and hence can be thought of as 𝛑-based

However, there are advantages of using certain bases over others in certain circumstances (which is why we have so many of them that get used, such as those listed above).  In construction for example, being able to use base 12, base 24, or base 30 means you have a lot of possible even divisors (12 is integer divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12; 30 is integer divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30).  Anything relating to angles benefits from using 𝛑 as a base, as it makes it easier to express as an integer value (i.e.: the circumference of a circle with a radius of 1 in base 10 is 6.283185307179586..., but in base 𝛑 it's just 2).  The math is overall the same; no physical laws change, but using a different base more suited to describing your problem can mean being able to work with easier, more precise integer values than using base 10 alone.  We can convert from any one base to any other base fairly simply, and we see this happen every day:  all of the above uses of different bases all get processed by binary-based digital computers.  Indeed, because of this one could argue that more science is now done in base 2 than it is in base 10; however we still often use base 10 for the _human readable representations_ of the math and results.

This does however bring us to one base that is somewhat special -- base _e_.  Base _e_ is the [most economical base](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324100419/http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2001/11/third-base/2), when you calculate the _economy_ as being a product of the number of symbols needed to express a number in that base and the number of symbols in the base.  For example, to express the numbers up to^1 one million in base 10 we need ten symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and six digits, giving us an economy of 60.  Expressing that same number range in binary uses just two symbols, but needs twenty digits, for an economy of 40.  Expressing it in hexadecimal uses sixteen symbols and five digits (economy of 80), but expressing it in _e_ has an economy of ~38.056.

Base _e_ also has some other nice properties.  For example, the natural logarithm in base _e_ behaves just like the common logarithm in base 10 (i.e: in base 10 log(10d) = 1, and in base _e_ log(10e) = 1).  Perhaps more importantly, doing calculus in base _e_ is simplified, due to the property that ````d/dx e^x = e^x````.

The big drawback of using base _e_ is that representing base 10 integer values (other than 0, 1, and 2) can't be expressed as an integer value.  In fact, most values we can express as an integer value in base 10 would be irrational in base _e_.  However, in applications where _e_ crops up naturally (of which there are many) doing math in base _e_ would have some huge advantages.  Unfortunately, building a computer based on base _e_ is (at least currently) impossible, and it is in computers where we do the bulk of our real calculations these days^2.

As with many other things, the numeric base of choice for a problem really depends on what you are trying to optimize for.  We already use lots of non-base 10 number systems in science, mathematics, and engineering when it makes sense to do so (as expressed above, usually when some operation can be done naturally with integer values in the specified base, or when a computation device is easier to build using a specified base).

[],agate_,,geo,[],,Geophysical Fluid Dynamics | Paleoclimatology | Planetary Sci,dark,text,t2_xwpqi,False,,"Several major differences.  First, the ""painting-like"" look of many of Junocam's photos comes from a false-color imaging process, which combines information from red, green, blue, and a methane-absorption band in the near infrared.  This really brings out detail in the clouds, and the wider wavelength range translates into more kaleidescopic images.  Galileo's solid-state imager also included a methane band filter, but for some reason most of the images released to the public were more red-green-blue images similar to what the naked eye sees.  

That said, the Galileo program did produce a bunch of false-color images similar in style to what you're seeing from Junocam:

https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00893

https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00895

On the technical side, there are some big differences in the cameras.  Galileo's camera was one of its main instruments, but it uses 1970s/1980s technology.  Juno's camera is literally an afterthought (see below), but it uses modern technology.  So Galileo's camera has much better ""zoom"", and can see more different wavelengths, but it had much less resolution (it's an 0.6 megapixel camera!).  Juno also has the advantage of flying *MUCH* closer to Jupiter than Galileo did, so it gets better close-ups.

But probably the most important difference is the goal of the camera.  Juno's main mission is to measure gravity and magnetic fields.  The original Juno design didn't have a camera at all!  But NASA insisted that one be added, mostly to provide the public with cool pictures.  Juno also is unique in providing its raw camera data to the public, and indeed, most of the cool pictures you're seeing were created by amateurs.

So while the Galileo images were processed in a way to increase their value as scientific data, the Juno images are being processed to make them look cool.  So it's not too surprising that they have a more artistic look.

[],neeps_n_tatties,,,[],,,,text,t2_kk57a,False,,"I agree with your points. To expand on them I think the distinction between ""mental"" and ""physical"" illnesses is a consequence of how the brain differs from other organ systems in terms of complexity.

The brain has billions of neurons and perhaps trillions of connections between them; there are also probably 10x as many non-neuronal cells (e.g. astrocytes) as there are neurons, which are able to modulate neuronal activity. This gives rise to an absolutely massive number of ways in which a brain can be ""wired"" and on the flip side a massive number of ways in which the wiring can break down.

With conventional ""medical"" illnesses there is usually a biological ""problem"" that can be isolated. H. pylori infection in peptic ulcers. Autoimmunity in Grave's disease or rheumatoid arthritis. The CFTR gene in cystic fibrosis. The brain can malfunction on a biological level when there's a genetic, infectious, autoimmune, etc. issue at play, but in contrast to other organs it can also malfunction on the level of its ""wiring"". In other words, even within a biologically ""normal"" brain, problems can arise in the way in which neurons are *networked* and the way various areas *communicate* with one another, a statement that is not as easily made (at least not to the same extent) for other organ systems.

I think ""mental"" illnesses occur in large part due to abnormalities in this wiring (with or without concomitant abnormalities in biology). This is borne out by the piles of neuroimaging data showing differences in how a brain afflicted by mental illness functions differently from a ""normal"" brain (a quick search turns up these meta-analyses for [depression](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.01045/full) and [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5767956/) as examples). It explains why non-biological stressors such as adverse childhood experiences have such a profound relationship with mental illness - the developing brain becomes trained in the maladaptive processing of and response to stimuli and consequently the normal network is disrupted. It explains why non-pharmacologic treatments to mental illness like CBT work so well - because fundamentally they function to ""retrain"" the brain, enabling it to internally communicate in a more adaptive manner. Moreover this could be why some pharmacologic treatments, while indisputably effective, fall short of cure and are often chronic therapies - because they are targeting a consequence of the disordered communication (e.g. low serotonin, high dopamine, etc.) rather than the disordered communication itself.

Diagnosing mental illness certainly involves subjectivity from both sides, and is less reliable than, say, an x-ray showing a broken bone.  Without empirical data, it's certainly impossible to be 100% accurate.

However, it's not the guessing game that some of the responses here are presenting it as.  

If I created a treatment and administered it to 3 people, and all 3 people improved, that's less useful than a treatment that's been administered to 10,000 people even if only 8,100 of whom improved.

With illnesses like depression, there is a pretty significant sample size, so modern treatments are still scientific and not at all experimental.

I was in a lot of pain, and certainly couldn't walk, but there was no break, bruising, or swelling.  I am not really well-versed in how to describe all the parts of the foot, and the pain was not hyper localized, so there was certainly a lot of failure from me on describing the pain.  

However, the doctor I went to see went through years of school, and even obtained a specialty regarding foot injuries.  On top of that, he has a massive database of relevant information from other current doctors with his specialty.  Because of all of this, his diagnosis was a ruptured plantar fascia, and his treatment was RICE and NSAIDs.  He didn't feel it was serious enough to suggest an MRI to find more empirical evidence.  However, he did feel it would be in my best interest to follow up in a couple weeks to make sure that my recovery was going as expected.  If my recovery isn't going as expected, he may change his treatment, or ask for further tests to narrow down his diagnosis.

[],MathAndMirth,,,[],,,,text,t2_boe84j,False,,"I've seen some of those claims. I think they're worth looking at, but not really conclusive.

To begin with, every one of the SSRIs on the market had to go through a rigorous process with placebo-controlled trials to be FDA-approved in the first place. That process might not be perfect, but someone who's going to claim that all of these trials somehow showed ineffective drugs to be effective needs to have something pretty good to back it up. 

I think that a big part of the reason that some of these studies show more pessimistic results for SSRIs that the original FDA trials has to do with the patient selection. SSRIs are not magical happy pills. They restore closer to normal levels of serotonin in the brain, which aids in executive function and lets the brain regulate thoughts and emotions normally. But not all cases of depression are caused by low levels of serotonin. If a person who doesn't have a serotonin deficiency takes an SSRI, it won't do any good (apart from a possible placebo effect). People who are depressed simply because they lack the coping mechanisms to deal with real or perceived life circumstances will not benefit from SSRIs, and should be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy instead.

Now imagine a large data set of people who take SSRIs. Were these prescriptions appropriate for all of them? Suppose that the prescriptions were appropriate for half of them. Then the other half of the patients would get no benefits from the SSRIs, so the *average* benefit over the whole group would only be half of that seen for patients who actually have low serotonin. I don't really have a good feel for what percentage of SSRI prescriptions are appropriate. But it's not too hard to imagine that a drug that works well *for the patients for whom it was designed* could fail to show statistically significant benefits when applied less selectively. 

There's no lab test that tells a doctor whether serotonin is low, so the only way to find out if an SSRI will help is to try it. The side effects are mild enough (though as you note, up to 40% of men may have some degree of sexual side effects) that doctors are usually pretty willing to let patients try them.

[],katinla,,eng,[],,Radiation Protection | Space Environments,dark,text,t2_fwp4z,False,,"It's not that simple, actually. Finding a specific index in an array works in constant time, that's right, but finding a specific entry in a filesystem isn't at all like accessing the array's nth element.

Since you mentioned size-dependent time I'm going to assume you have some basic knowledge of data structures, and algorithm efficiency in terms of the ""big Oh notation"". Please let me know if you want me to expand on a particular concept.

A filename is a string. Matching a filename to an entry in the filesystem requires a data structure that can use strings as keys. In an ideal world you would be able to convert a string directly into an array subindex with a simple arithmetical calculation, and then you would only access that particular cell in constant time. This data structure is called direct mapping and the ""simple arithmetical calculation"" is usually called enumeration function (it can be seen as an extreme case of a hashtable in which the hash function is guaranteed not to produce any collisions). It's the best data structure in terms of time, but it carries significant disadvantages in terms of space, especially if the set of possible keys is too big: the array becomes too big and most cells are unused. This is exactly what's happening if you use strings as keys: if you try to define an enumeration function for strings you'll see the image of the function (in mathematical terms) becomes an immense set. So the array that you'd need for filenames would take up the whole space of your disk or more, and you'd have nothing left for file contents.

(Direct mapping is still a beautiful data structure in the very few cases in which your set of keys is small and enumerable.)

So you need a more space efficient data structure. This will inevitably impact search time (as well as creation and deletion time).

The second design consideration when choosing a data structure for a filesystem is that, unlike RAM, the disk is read *by sectors*. In order to read a single byte from disk the OS needs to request the read of a whole sector which is usually 512 bytes. Since you have some basic knowledge of data structures you'll know that most search algorithms make very sparse memory accesses (e.g. binary search jumps to the middle of an array, then to the quarter, than to the eighth, etc). It'd really be a waste of disk access time if you request a whole sector each time.

So there are a couple of data structures that are optimized (or can be optimized) for disk: B-trees and hash tables. The principle of optimization is clustering search keys so that if one has been read, then the ones adjacent to it are very likely to be read next. This will significantly reduce the number of times the OS has to request a sector from the disk.

Hashtables are easy to optimize for this by increasing the number of slots in a bucket until the bucket size in bytes is as big as you can fit in a sector. So the hash function tells you to read bucket N, then you request a single sector from disk and read several keys in it.

B trees are similar to binary trees, except that a node can have N keys and N+1 descendants instead of 2. (You can think of a binary tree as a special case of B tree in which N=1). The search algorithm is: compare the search key to the ith key, if it's smaller follow the pointer at the left of i, if bigger increase i and iterate, fail if you hit the end of the node. Same principle here: choose N so that the node size fits the sector size as closely as possible.

Whether the filesystem uses hashtables or B trees will depend on the OS and filesystem type (ext4, FAT, NTFS, etc.). I'm not aware of the specifics of all of them, but Linux ext4 tries to combine the advantages of hashtables and B trees in a structure they call ""hashed B tree"". [https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4\_Disk\_Layout#Hash\_Tree\_Directories](https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout#Hash_Tree_Directories)

So you know, the search time in a B-tree is logarithmic, hash tables are a bit more complicated as it depends a lot on the efficiency of the hash function and load factor.

Last thing to consider: a filesystem isn't a single data structure. Each directory is a data structure mapping filenames to entries (which can be either files or directories themselves, hence the algorithm is recursive). Searching for something like ""c:\\users\\katinla\\Documents\\images"" would first search the root for a directory named ""users"", then that directory for ""katinla"", etc. That increases the search time.

Buuuut...... the use case you mentioned:

&gt;I want to find a file I KNOW I have on my computer, but don't know where it is.

is making things a lot worse. You have to search a data structure but you don't know *which* data structure to search. So the OS has to enumerate all keys in the root directory, then for each of them 1) search for the file and, if it's not found, 2) descend into subdirectories and repeat.

It's inevitably going to take a lot of time.

(Writing this post made me think, this particular use case could be optimized if you put a central data structure matching filenames to directories containing them. It would yield a *set* of directories as output since the same filename in different directories is allowed.

Well, meteor and air.  The heat of entry vaporizes some of the meteor, and the vapor chemically reacts with the air around it to create new compounds.  By analyzing the light with telescopes, scientists have learned that it's mostly magnesium, iron, calcium, and sodium, with some oxygen and nitrogen from the atmosphere too.

As for why they keep glowing so long, the intense heat strips electrons off many of these compounds, and in the thin atmosphere it takes a while for them to rejoin.  When they do, they give off light, in the same way a neon sign does.

The last link below is pretty cool: some astronomers were trying to observe the elements in a supernova but a big meteor went right in front of it, ruining their data.  So they decided to write a paper about the elements in the meteor.

That's an easy thing to say if you've only ever coded in specific ""bubbles"" in the industry.  If you're primarily coding web-based applications that focus on a lot of business logic, then I don't expect you're going to run into too many instances where algorithmic complexity is an issue (indeed, in areas where algorithmic complexity _are_ an issue, you're likely using standard libraries which have already taken these into account for you, such as providing QuickSort routines instead of using naive Bubble Sorts).

But it's not correct to say that such problems don't exist.  Anything pertaining to resource management almost always boils down to being a Knapsack problem, and while we do have some efficient algorithms to _approximate_ solutions that are often good enough in there here and now, having an _actual_ provable solution that runs efficiently would have major repercussions for how we store data (effectively bin packing), to how we schedule threads/processes.  Indeed, all sorts of scheduling problems are in NP, and scheduling is used globally by every industry, for both computational and non-computational tasks.  Efficient solutions to these problems would improve both human and computer efficiency.

FWIW, I'm not in academia either (at least not anymore).  I'm a Principal Software Developer with &gt;25 years of experience in the industry.  And I'll agree that most people working in the industry don't need to be all that aware of P vs NP on a daily basis -- but that's more because most developers are hired to effectively do grunt-work where algorithmic efficiency isn't a huge concern.

However, someone has to write those libraries that perform more complex algorithmic activities.  Someone had to write the thread scheduler for your operating system, and they likely needed to worry about the big O of their algorithms so you don't have to.

[],Lognu,,,[],,,,text,t2_5d91ldm,False,,"Most people here point at the Millenium Problems, a set of seven problems proposed by the Clay Institute in 2000. So far, only the Poincaré Conjecture has been solved by mathematician Grigori Perelman. He refused the million dollar prize and the Fields Medal, arguably the greatest prize in Mathematics.

The Millennium Problems were inspired by 1900 David Hilbert's Problems of the Century, a list of 23 problems he deemed important for the progress of Mathematics. Among Hilbert's Problems, one is considered particularly hard: the Riemann hypothesis. Proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, it also appears as one of the Millennium Problems. I will now try to describe it, if you don't want to read any Mathematics, just skip the next paragraph. I still encourage you to try.

The Riemann hypothesis deals with a particular function. Namely, for any number ""s"" consider the sum of all natural numbers to the power of ""s"". E.g. for s=1 we obtain 1+2+3+4+5+... (which sums up to infinity), while for s=-2 we have 1+1/4+1/9+1/16+1/25+... which is known to add up to the square of π divided by 6. In general, we know that for all s smaller than -1 this sum is finite. Riemann used a technique called ""analytic continuation"" to 
 assign a finite number to sums which add up to infinity. For instance, there is a sense in saying that 1+2+3+4+5+...=-1/12. Furthermore, it now made sense to also use ""complex numbers"" in place of ""s"". Complex numbers are numbers which can be written as ""a+ib"", where ""a"" and ""b"" are real numbers (just regular numbers). They follow their own set of rules, use Wikipedia if you want to read more. Now the big question is: when is this sum equal to zero? It is quite easy (for a specialized mathematician) to show that the sum is zero for all positive even numbers. Riemann hypothesis states that all other zeros must satisfy a=1/2.

Why should we care about Riemann hypothesis? Surprisingly enough, the distribution of zeros is linked to the distribution of prime numbers. Prime numbers are the fundamental blocks of multiplication and division, studied for millennia, there is still a huge number of questions about them. The solution to the Riemann hypothesis would provide great insight to this problems. An interesting real-world application concerns the encryption of transmitted data, such as credit card numbers and personal info. The security of the RSA, the most widely used encryption tool in online transactions, highly depends on our incomplete knowledge about prime numbers.

During the last 150 years, many people claimed to have solved the Riemann hypothesis, but all their proofs failed under a diligent scrutiny. Some people even start to believe that the problem is undecidable i.e. it is not possible to prove whether the Riemann hypothesis is true or not within the realm of ""standard"" Mathematics.",1564917270,{},evy0hsw,False,t3_clsjm0,False,True,t3_clsjm0,/r/askscience/comments/clsjm0/are_there_any_currently_unsolved_equations_that/evy0hsw/,1564917271.0,1,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],YaztromoX,,computing,[],,Systems Software,dark,text,t2_ngsr1,False,,"In Computer Science, we like to quantify algorithms based on how their running time is affected as the input size grows.  Some algorithms run at the exact same speed regardless of input size, while others become significantly more complicated much quicker as the input size increases.  By way of an example of an easy case is pulling a value out of an array -- it doesn't matter if we ask for array item 2 or array item 29 756, the speed of doing so is constant.  A more complicated case would be something like chess -- we can calculate all possible moves on a smaller chess board, but as the board gets bigger we get into a situation where calculating all possible games would require every computer mankind ever manufactured to date to run until the heat death of the universe...and it still wouldn't complete.

So we have a notation for describing an algorithms runtime complexity ([Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), and we can put problems with similar runtime constraints into a _complexity class_.  And there are two very important complexity classes called 'P'  and 'NP' that many algorithms fit into^0.  

Algorithms that are part of 'P' have two important characteristics: the time they take to run can be described as a polynomial (that is, by an equation of the form ""an^k + bn^k-1 + cn^k-2...+xn^2 + yn +z""^1), and the time required to verify the solution can also be described as a polynomial.

Algorithms that are part of 'NP' also have a similar pair of characteristics.  Like problems in 'P', the solutions can be verified in polynomial time.  However, their runtime to calculate the solution in the first place only runs in polynomial time on a _non-deterministic_ Turing machine, which may be worse than polynomial time when run on a _deterministic_ Turing machine^2.  You don't have to worry about the details of what that means -- but generally it means that these are problems where we can verify the result in polynomial time (or ""poly time"" for short), but where the computation itself may not be computable in poly time.

Using the above definitions, it's not hard to see that every problem in P is also in NP.  If you were to draw a Venn diagram, P would be a circle entirely inside NP.  All P problems can be verified in polynomial time, and all of their runtimes can be run in poly time on a non-deterministic Turing machine (as well as running in poly time in a completely deterministic Turing machine).

So here is where the unsolved equation comes in:  we know that P is inside NP.  However, is P = NP?  That is, can _every_ problem in NP be reformulated such that it would also be in P?  Or are there problems in NP that can't be reformulated to also be in P?

This has been an open question in computer science for much of the past century, and currently there is no proof either way.  Many computer scientists _believe_ that P ≠ NP, but there is no actual proof one way or another (on a side note, some feel that P = NP, however some in that camp feel that any conversion of a NP problem into P would be non-constructive^5).

Okay -- so what is the point of all this über-nerd gobbledygook?  It reads like a whole bunch of mental masturbation for eggheads -- is this important in the real world?

The answer to that decision problems is a big YES.  Some extremely important algorithms that people rely upon in their daily lives currently rely on the assumption that P ≠ NP.  One of the most important of these is _encryption_.  Decryption can be thought of as a decision problem -- given an input (the encrypted data), we can quickly verify if our ""solution"" is correct (that is, did the decryption work?  Did we get the right decrypted data back?).  But how useful would decryption be if we could also decrypt _any_ data (without the decryption key) in polynomial time on any computer?  What would happen if it was also very easy to decrypt any encrypted information without a password or encryption key?  Right now the whole contract of encryption is that it is very easy to decrypt data if you have the proper encryption key, but that without the encryption key decrypting the data is more difficult, and gets more and more difficult as the key size increases.  Decrypting data with a 2048 bit key would require more time in the average case than the expected lifetime of our solar system.  Proving that P = NP, and then finding a constructive solution to convert an NP decryption algorithm such that it is also in P would likely break the way we encrypt data.  This could have serious repercussions to how virtually all commerce and personal privacy on Earth works.^6

At the same time, it could make a lot of problems that are very difficult to solve computationally more efficient.  This could have all sorts of positive benefits (that outweigh the negatives of breaking encryption).  The Knapsack problem^7, for example, is in NP and is thus more and more difficult to solve as the number of items you could potentially put into the knapsack increases.  But if we had an efficient way to convert this problem such that it was also in P it would potentially have all sorts of positive benefits in the real world^9.  All of the world shipping logistics for example could be significantly improved -- the Knapsack Problem isn't any different than figuring out what sets of items to pack into a shipping container to maximize the weight and number of items being shipped -- companies that were able to efficiently compute this for each cargo container, and for each ship (as you can think of assigning containers to ships as an instance of the Knapsack Problem as well!).

This problem is so important that is it one of the seven [Millennium Prize Problems](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems).  I'd also argue that it's the most important problem, as if you could solve it and prove that P = NP, [it may mean that a computer could generate proofs for all of the other Millennium Prize Problems](http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/pvsnp.pdf)^10.  So if you can solve this one, you _might_ also be able to efficiently solve all of the _other_ major mathematical problems of our time.

How cool would _that_ be?  HTH!

^0 -- 'P' and 'NP' problems are formulated as _decision problems_, that is problems where the result is YES or NO.  Conceivably, we can generally take problems and convert it into a decision problem -- a sort algorithm, for example, may be reformulated as a sorting algorithm where at the end we ask ""Is this list sorted?"", and we get back a YES or NO response.  I'm trying to keep things somewhat simple to understand for laypeople, so I'm not going to deal with these specifics in this post.  
^1 -- I would have preferred to use the same letter for the term multipliers with subscripts, but AFAIK Reddit doesn't permit subscripts, only superscripts.  So please don't take my use of a, b, c, x, y, and z to imply that there are only 26 terms in the polynomial form.  There could be just one, or there could be thousands.  
^2 -- Ugh, I've been trying to reformulate a way to discuss this without getting into the differences between deterministic and non-deterministic machines, or what a Turing machine is^3.  The simplest explanation is that the computers we run are all like deterministic Turing machines^4; a non-deterministic Turing machine is one that you can think of is allowed to ""guess"" at answers.  
^3 -- at its simplest, it's a simple mathematical model of a computer used to prove what computers can do, and what they can't do.  
^4 -- You can think of ""deterministic"" to mean that given a series of instructions, the machine will runt he instructions one at a time, and won't just decide to go and do its own thing once in a while.  
^5 -- a [_non-constructive proof_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof#Non-constructive_proofs) is one that doesn't create or provide an actual object to demonstrate the proof.  So in this case, it would be a proof that doesn't actually show _how_ to convert a problem from NP into P, and which doesn't provide an example of converting a problem in NP to also be in P.  
^6 -- There are some conditions here.  I've been somewhat hand-wavy concerning some of the specifics of the runtime constraints for a poly time algorithm.  Most people wind up thinking that ""poly time"" means _fast_, and everything else means _slow_.  That isn't necessarily the case -- n^10 is polynomial, and has worse runtime characteristics than an algorithm that runs in exponential time of 2^n (for n&gt;~1.07755 that is, and since n is generally considered to be an integer value, you can say this is true for an n &gt; 1).  However, algorithms that have such massive poly time exponentials are pretty rare, so we don't run into cases like this very often.  So while not a universal truth, in most _known_ cases problems in P run faster than problems in NP that are not also in P.  
^7 -- the Knapsack Problem is pretty easy to visualize.  Say you have a knapsack, and a bunch of items of different weights^8.  The Knapsack Problem asks:  which items should you pack such that you get closest to some fixed maximum weight value?  
^8 -- you can also think of items with different volumes if you prefer.  In fact, a multi-dimensional Knapsack problem could look at both the volume and mass of the items, as well as potentially other factors (such as their monetary value).  
^9 -- other than being very useful for your next camping trip.

[],non-stick-rob,,,[],,,,text,t2_ylaed,False,,"There are Many, MANY factors, and permutations as outlined by numerous other wise commenters before me.  So here's my shot at answering as clearly as possible. it's a small list, and not nearly as complete, but these are the main (in my experience) causes for speed fluctuations during transfer.  hope it helps !

**.file sizes**. -  The overhead of any size files details is the same. name, size, type, date modified etc. Small files still have to copy the same minimum information as a big file.Transferring 1024 of 1kb files will take way longer than one 1mb file.

**.disk cluster size**.  - a single 1byte file will take up 4096 bytes of space in windows default ntfs. This means the heads travel further (slower), but disk wear is reduced compared to a 2048 byte cluster size. 2048 byte utilises the wasted disk space, but the heads and disk do more work. also, files are split into 2048 byte sectors. So can be addressed quickly. but this means Defragmentation routines (at disk read/write wear cost) need to be more frequent to keep files that are split as contiguous (next to each other) as possible.    

**.on access anti virus**. this is a **big** speed impairment. If file is even looked at in a list by the user, Anti-virus is taking it's share of resources to inspect the file against detection signatures. And if using hueristic analysis, can just add to the slow transfer. Again,  smaller files require the same minimums here as large files.

**.hardware capability.** spin speed (for hdd) is a BIG deciding factor. Many commercial server disks spin at a rate of around 10k or 15k (rpm)  and enable fast data access and error checking. Most domestic drives spin at around 7200. Storages drive such as WD red do not specify a speed, but rather focus on power usage and will ramp up or down the speed accordingly. however. such drives tend to spin at 5400 rpm to give them life better expectancy and reliability. 

In addition to that, **different manufacturers** of drives will also slow things. Because read/write/verify processes for all storage devices is often not consistent between drives, let alone manufacturers.

 The **operating system** is reporting what it is handling at that time, and will update frequently:

1. to show the user that something is going on and 

2. to give a best guess estimate if the rest of the transfer process is the same continually (it never is, due to the reasons above)

[],za419,,,[],,,,text,t2_95qb7,False,,"What you're looking for is called a file system. A simple one would be FAT or the one in xv6. 

First, the first bit of data on a disk is a boot block. This is independent of the OS mostly - it tells the BIOS how to start loading the operating system, and it tells you how the disk is partitioned.

Each partition has its own filesystem. For xv6 and other unixes, the filesystem is usually broken up into 'blocks' of a given size (512 bytes for xv6 IIRC), where the first block is the 'superblock', which tells you what kind of FS it is, and has some information on how to read it. Importantly, it has data on where to find an inode block, which contains data on all files in the system.

Each file has its Metadata stored in an inode. The inode stores information about which disk its on, how many filenames refer to this inode, how big the file is, and then it has a structure describing where the file data is on the disk - in xv6, going from memory, it has room to directly address eleven blocks, plus one block which is used for more 'indirectly addressed' blocks. Each block is identified by offset, and has fixed size, and it's order in the file is in order of its location in the disk structure.

Basically, one address says 'file data exists at bytes 1024 to 1535'. The entire inode structure says 'this file is stored on disk 1. This record is reused twice. It is 4052 bytes long. It is stored in the following blocks on disk.'

The final piece of the puzzle is a directory. A directory is a special file whose information, instead of file data, is a bunch of pairs of filenames and inode numbers.

Therefore, when you take a directory tree at the root, your computer will look at the (hardcoded) root inode, load the directory data, then display those filenames. When you look into a directory, it will open that inode and display data from there, and when a program tries to read a file, it will look at that inode and read blocks in order of the pointers stored there.",1564690088,{},evqbb60,False,t3_cknf01,False,True,t1_evporp4,/r/askscience/comments/cknf01/why_does_bitrate_fluctuate_eg_when_transfer_files/evqbb60/,1564690173.0,1,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted to clarify some of the comments and expand on them. So, what you're seeing is a data visualization of everything that we observe from our position in the Universe. And, as it's been pointed out, we're seeing distant objects as they *were*, X number of years ago (as it has taken the light X number of years to reach us.) 

However, there is no such thing as where something 'should be' but isn't, because there is no one preferred position (or ""God Frame"") of the Universe! We can only describe where and when an object is relative to something else in space (the where) and time (the when). Hence... *relativity!* (cue dramatic music) 

The concept of ""seeing all the way back to \~3\[8\]0,000 years after the Big Bang"" needs some important clarification. Prior to 380,000 years, the entire Universe looked almost exactly identical to the interior of our Sun. Around 380,000 after the big bang, the Universe expanded and cooled enough that electrons and protons formed stable orbits around Hydrogen Nuclei, making them electrically neutral and thus allowing light to freely travel. So, this light existed everywhere... and it still exists everywhere today! However, since the Universe has expanded so much, these lightwaves have been stretched out into the microwave spectrum and are very, very low energy (around 2.72 degrees Kelvin with tiny variations predicted by Quantum Theory). The important nuance here, is that they're not 'traveling towards us'... they're all around us! 

Now, a very interesting thing to think about.. if you lived in one of those distant galaxies and made a similar map of your night sky, what would you expect to see? It turns out...

How do you know that desertification will continue in the Arabian deserts and Australian outback? Is it not just as likely that the increased rainfall (due to higher temperatures) and changing weather patterns could make these tracts of lands more inhabitable and farmable?

What about all of the frozen land in Siberia etc? Wouldn't a global warming mean that its possible this land would also become arable and usable?

Biodiversity; won't the increased vegetation growth rates due to higher CO2 and temperatures result in more available resources and possibly increased biodiversity? The pollinator issue seems tangential to climate change and probably more related to aggressive farming and modern pesticides. Biodiversity has always been much higher in times of higher temperatures. You can see that in the fossil record. The acid in the oceans thing seems a bit off also to be honest. There are big differences in pH across the whole of the barrier reef; a greater difference than the predicted rise in acidity. Coral and shell fish being some of the oldest organisms on the planet; I'm sure that they will be able to adapt. 

Regarding the ocean currents; the water at the poles will still be colder than the rest of the ocean surely? Maybe there's less heat capacity due to the ice no longer being there, but there'll still be significant temperature gradients across the oceans, and so still significant convection. Did all the fish die when there were no ice caps in the past? I doubt it.

As to the system correcting for the increased CO2 in the atmosphere; if it does turn out to be as catastrophic as you outline, then I'm sure that future generations will rise to the challenge.

The models that a lot of the science is based on for these conclusions are just models. They try to fit them to historic data and use them to predict the future. But we know that huge and complex systems like the planet or the economy are very difficult to predict; especially in times of significant change and discontinuity.

However: I went over the review and it is the worst paper I have ever read. I am not exaggerating to dismiss your point, really. But I have to be truthful. Here a couple points that I thought about the paper the last couple minutes: 

1. It is already a bad sign if a meta analysis has only 22 references. The author should have compiled a comprehensive collection of facts about **how** sugar molecularly glycosylates proteins in cells and tissues. Then also studies or sound hypotheses why dietary sugar should accumulate in your skin to such high concentrations that it spontaneously glycosylates collagen. Now how, no why, no mechanisms at all, only sloppily curated data.
2. Many important numbers/facts were stated in this review **without** giving any reference. If a Bachelor's student in Biology does that in an essay, they get a big minus point. This is unacceptable in a published paper.
3. There was no conclusive data presented thats ties in wrinkles with dietary sugar. Only data that collagen can get glycosylated (every protein can), that if you eat alot of sugar there is more sugar in your skin (like in the rest of your body, hyperglycemia), that cultured cells turn on ageing pathways when you put a lot of sugar in the medium (not relevant for a human organism, they probably just slowly die because of osmotic pressure) and a lot more stuff to patch together a story.

So the incomplete data plus the facts that it is a really really bad paper tells my mind and my gut feeling that one cannot trust what this paper states.

[],YaztromoX,,computing,[],,Systems Software,dark,text,t2_ngsr1,False,,"Modern video games can store a _lot_ of state data.  They may be storing information such as:

* You characters current location
* Your characters current status (health and other basic stats, for example)
* Items your character is carrying around (or has in some sort of in-game storage)
* Items you have equipped
* Game play time
* Missions you have completed
* Characters you have encountered (and potentially their current state)
* Items that are damaged or destroyed
* Any other game state.

This can be a lot of information to save, and back in an era where space for storing save data was at a premium (perhaps only a few kilobytes of storage at best!), using save points can simplify your location save data immensely.  Now instead of having to store a series of coordinates (and perhaps things like that direction you're facing at save time), you can store a single number that represents the save location.  And as a given game probably doesn't have thousands of save points (especially for a game of the save-point era of the 90s), you can likely just store the location value in a single unsigned 8-bit integer.

Various games also do other things to make their saves smaller and easier to deal with.  Games where equipment is doled out at specific locations and can't be lost may only store the save point location value in their save.  Games that use save points to refill character status (such as the Save Spheres in the Final Fantasy games) don't have to store your current health/manna/other current status, as you can simply presume that these values will be at their maximums when you load the game.

Having fixed save points also aids in QA and Testing of games before they go to market.  It's impossible to verify in games that allow you to save anywhere that every possible save point can be loaded correctly and as expected, but is relatively easy to test in games that have fixed save points.

However, primarily the main reason for save points is due to storage constraints.  A good example of this was the original [Tomb Raider (1996)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_\(1996_video_game\)).  In the MS-DOS version for PCs, you could save anywhere you like, however on the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn ports, you were limited to saving at ""Save Crystals"", due in large part to save size limitations on these consoles (the PS1 for example uses 128KB memory cards, and were designed to hold saves from multiple games at once).

As an aside, save game subsystems for video games are rarely particularly advanced.  In modern games, a save is likely just a memory dump of a specific region of memory decimated to storing state information for the game, with a CRC or hash attached (so the save can be verified), and possibly some form of encryption added on top (to help prevent tampering).  This is a big reason why the saves of many games aren't portable -- different platforms may have differing endianness for the data, and may have different byte alignments that prevents the same binary data from being loaded elsewhere.

[],YaztromoX,,computing,[],,Systems Software,dark,text,t2_ngsr1,False,,"u/mfukar answered [this very question four years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2ke0o5/we_have_32_and_64bit_cpus_why_not_a_128bit_cpu/clkf8sd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).  His response still stands.

As with anything we make for mass consumption, the big question that arises is one of _need_.  What need do we have of a 128-bit processor at this time?  What problems will it solve that can't be solved on a 64-bit processor?

I don't intend this question to be reductionist, such as to argue that we don't ""need"" 64-bit processors, or 32-bit processors, or 16-bit processors, etc.  Here is a brief list of the value ranges^0 of values a variety of common (some mores in the past) bit widths permit:

* **8-bit**: 0 - 256
* **16-bit**: 0 - 65 536^1
* **32- bit**: 0 - 4 294 967 296
* **64-bit**: 0 - ~1.8 * 10^19
* **128-bit**: 0 - ~3.4 * 10^38

Generally with processor bit widths, there are a few areas where this has an impact:

* **Size of internal registers, which limits the size of values you can calculate with in a single clock cycle**;
* **Size of the memory bus, and hence how much memory you can address**^2
* **Number of bits used to describe an instruction (opcode)**^3

Note that the size of the internal registers generally provides a limit on the size of values you can compute with in a single clock cycle.  _All digital computers can deal with values larger than they can store in a single register_, however the computation time for dealing with such values increases, as you require multiple computations to compute the final value.^4

I'm going to ignore the opcode size, as ever since the 8086/8088 era we've had way more possible opcodes than we've had instructions to go with them.  The 8086/8088 could describe up to 256 opcodes, but only had around 120.  The number of valid opcodes has grown since then, but at nowhere near the rate that the fitness of processors has evolved.  However, the last two -- size of the internal registers and addressing bus lines are important for the remainder this discussion.

8, 16, and 32-bit processors all run into the simple problem that their register sizes describe maximum values that are easily within human reach.  The device you're reading this post on probably cost at least $256.  The number of elk in Canada is close to 65 536^5.  There are well over 4.2 billion people on earth.  It's not difficult to find computable numbers ranging into the billions, and even trillions, in the world.

This extends to addressing.  With a 32-bit processor (with 32-bit addressing), we can uniquely address 4GB of RAM^6.  In todays world, that's a real limitation.  There are a variety of databases that can easily exceed 4GB (if stored completely in RAM), and it isn't difficult to come across large data files which could easily fill this much RAM (is loaded all at once).

64-bit processors however, as you can see from the list towards the top of this post, expand the amount of values storable in a single register, or addressable to an unimaginable quantity.  With a range of up to 1.8 * 10^19, you're going to be able to capture values in a single register for the vast majority of computational purposes.  All of the money in the world is estimated (broadly) to be on the order of 8 * 10^14.  The entire insect population of earth is roughly 10^19.  You can deal with these values in a single register.

And in terms of addressing, a 64-bit processor (with 64 addressing lines) can address 16 _Exabytes_ of RAM.  That's 1.6*10^10 Gigabytes of RAM.  By way of comparison, the [Titan supercomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_\(supercomputer\)) has nearly 700Tb of RAM -- so still nearly 23 000 times less what a 64-bit computer can address.

The point of all of this being, we have got to a point where a 64-bit computer can handle more memory and values larger than humans typically need to deal with in a single clock cycle.  As such, there really isn't an _economic_ argument for going to a general-purpose 128-bit processor.

All that said, we _do_ have processors [capable of storing and computing 128-bit values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/128-bit) already, and have for &gt;20 years.  There have ben a number of processors over the last few decades which have [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instructions whereby you can pack multiple computable values into a single, larger register, and have the same operation performed against all of them in a single instruction.  The Emotion Engine in the PlayStation 2 had 128-bit registers for SIMD instructions to speed up game computation, for example.^7  

Will a time ever come where we need 128-bits for general purpose computing?  It's hard to say.  There will no doubt be specialized applications which can benefit from 128-bit computing (being able to quickly handle IPv6 addresses in routing equipment would be one possible use case).  But will we ever hit upon the 64-bit memory limit?  And will general-purpose computers ever need to efficiently deal with massive numbers beyond the magnitude of 10^19?  While it seems unlikely now, who knows what the future holds?

^0 -- I'm assuming unsigned values here; obviously if we treat one bit as a sign bit the range will  shift to -2^(n-1) ... 2^(n-1)-1, where _n_ is the number of bits.  
^1 -- As an aside, Intel 16-bit processors, like the 8086, 8088, 80186, 80188, and 80286, had a bigger address bus than their bit-ness implies; the 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 all had 20-bit memory addressing lines; the 80286 had 24-bit memory addressing lines.  The former set of processors could thus address 1MB of memory; the 80286 could address 16MB of RAM.  
^2 -- as noted above, it's possible to have more memory addressing lines than the bit-ness of your processor otherwise calculates with.  This can impose a speed penalty when doing calculations with memory pointers, as it may require multiple clock cycles to complete due to the data width size mismatch.  Conversely, it's also possible for a processor to have fewer physical address lines than its bit-ness implies; at this time for example there is no Intel or AMD 64-bit processor that actually has a full 64-bits worth of address lines, as the amount of memory needed to fill such a system is infeasible at this time.  
^3 -- this can have an impact on the number of possible opcodes available in a processor.  
^4 -- Put another way, you can add two 64-bit numbers on an 8-bit CPU, it just requires 8 different Add-with-Carry instructions, along with LOAD/STORE instructions to bring in the values to be added 8-bits at a time, whereas on a 64-bit CPU you can do the same calculation in one ADD instruction.  
^5 -- the number is [actually estimated to be around 72 000](http://www.hww.ca/en/wildlife/mammals/north-american-elk.html), but close enough for the sake of example.  
^6 -- Once again seeing this limitation as problematic, Intel introduced _Physical Address Extensions_ to some of its later 32-bit processors, which allows you to address more memory via additional address lines.  
^7 -- the PS2 EE was hardly the first CPU with 128-bit registers and SIMD instructions, as SIMD goes back to the 1960s, and Intel has SIMD instructions in the mid 90s.

A RAW picture, one frame, as you pointed out will be about 50 megabytes while a 1080 JPEG is probably going to be in 1-2Mb range.

If you apply that math to your 806Gb video even on the high end of 2Mb per frame you get about 260Gb. still too big fro a blue-ray but at lot smaller and we still have done 0 compression frame to frame. 

To encode a video, that is to take it from that ludicrous RAW size to something that will fit on a blue-ray, both lossy compression similar to JPEG and other compression methods like looking at how much data changes frame to frame. This frame to frame compression can benefit hugely from the lossy compression as now much more of the data will be the same frame to frame.

How small you get the video depends on how aggressive you get with the lossy compression. On a blue-ray you do not get aggressive at all and your video quality is high enough that most people could not tell it from RAW but your file will be 30-40Gb. For a paid streaming service like netflix you get a bit more aggressive mostly because if you did not your stream would be 50-70mb per second which is not very practical for a lot of people. For a free service like youtube you get very aggressive. After all youtube has to store all there videos on hard drives and not charge you for it.

Don't know the rows and columns count, but its a LOT bigger than 1920x 1080 - like 10X. However, as one person points out, multiple layers of compression are used. Typically this includes sync frames (image of full screen) followed by some number of partial screen updates. However, full screens are not full sized - original jpeg used FFT / Cosine transform that breaks down subelement arrays into series of elements that encode different pixel change frequency elements. Think big square, all black or all white. Then think square divided in half, half black, half white on left and right,  Then the reverse, Then Top and Bottom. Now break into quarters, and all combinations. Each of these can be represented by a code. Each matrix of size NxN can be described by a combination of these frequency elements times a multiplier that turns the white levels in to different shades of grey. Now throw out half of the codes - for the highest fequency elements. The picture gets a little blurrier, but it's only 1/2 or 1/4 the size of values for the full data size.  JPEG 2000 introduced a new type of transform called wavelet that more precisely focuses how the changed data is coded. You can throw out more data where the image is less changing and keep more where it has high detail. Another piece of the pie. Images are generally not saved in RGB pixel configuration. There's a lot of redundancy between the colors of a pixel in an image. More typically the pixels would be transformed in HSV (hue saturation and value). H defines the color, saturation the graduations of brightness for the color, and V the greyscale brightness of the pixel. H and S values tend to remain much closer together/unchanged for objects/areas in an image, with only the greyscale changing for features in the image. So you can separately compress the color data from the greyscale data with the transform technicque.  Also, for movie files a long sequence or video might only have little bit of change, but later on there's a whole lot or change (think of explosions or car wrecks ore some thing). If you're streaming the data over a network link with limited bandwidth, the mostly unchanging data may be smaller than the bandwidth, but when there's a lot of change, bigger than you can deliver. So, they code the video sequence with some time codes of when it applies to the video stream. That way they can ""pre-deliver"" some of the high detail periods during parts of the video stream when not all the bandwidth is needed. Then, when the fast changing content is needed, some of it comes off ""the wire"" but other parts come from buffered data that was predelivered in the preceding seconds of the data stream.",1563898373,{},eul8rlk,False,t3_cgqrv7,False,True,t1_euk2wf7,/r/askscience/comments/cgqrv7/how_are_movie_files_not_huge_assuming_the/eul8rlk/,1563898393.0,3,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,1564577925.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

a) 10 to 11 mpg
b) 33 to 50 mpg

It's a trick question; they both would save you about 100 gallons over 10,000 miles.

Similarly, if we look at the Mercury Mountaineer's fuel economy at three different speeds: 23.8 mpg @ 55mph, 21.2 mpg @ 65 mph, and 17.8 @ 75 mph.

Over the course of 100 miles, the Mountaineer would burn 4.20 gal @ 55 mph, 4.71 gal @ 65 mph, and 5.62 gal @ 75 mph. If you plot these in Excel, you can see that it does not look like a very linear trend. This confusion with differences in miles per gallon is a big reason why there is a push to move towards a standard like gallons per 100 miles, but I digress.

The next issue is that there are only three points of data, which is the absolute minimum number of data points required to establish a trendline. Ideally, you'd want more data to firmly establish what kind of relationship you're looking at with fuel economy vs. speed.

In the picture I linked above [(I meant this one)](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/img/meiv2.timeseries.png), El Nino is the red part and La Nina is the blue part. El Nino and La Nina are specifically oceanographyic phenomena while the Southern Oscillation is the corresponding atmospheric phenomon. The global wind patterns blow north-west direction in the southern low latitudes. Along the west coast of South America this leads to upwelling due to Ekman transport. The wind blows along the coast and the surface water is being pushed away from the coast towards the open pacific. Since the surface water is displaced deep ocean water is flowing upwards along the coast. For this reason there is a lot of cold water on the western coast of South America. All the warm surface water is being pushed towards the equator across the pacific. You can see this in this crosssection of the water in the pacific along the equator. At the west side (Asian coast) of the pacific there is a lot of warm water, at the east side (South American coast) the cold water from the deep ocean is near the surface. This is the normal or average situation. [In this picture you can see the average sea surface temperature (SST) of the southern pacific.](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/styles/node_lightbox_display/public/key_figures/climate_data_set/SST1_climatology_Pacific.png?itok=Fz-kgzB3) In the west there is a lot of warm water, while in the east there is a blob of cold water right off the South American coast.

Now every couple of years this process stops and the warm water from the west sloshes back towards the east. This is El Nino. [In this figure you can see the sea surface temperature anomaly during the last El Nino event](https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/Sea-surface-temperature-anomalies-Sep-2015.png). Sea surface temperature anomaly doesn't show the absolute temperature but rather the difference to the average temperatures. What you can see is that the SST around indonesia and east of Australia is lower than normal and much higher than normal along the equator and west of the South American coast. During this time there is little upwelling of cold deep water at the South American coast. This change in SST has large consequences on the global atmospheric circulation system. That's why El Nino has such a large impact. 

La Nina is the opposite of El Nino, when the SST anomalies go in the other direction. [You can see an example during 2010s strong La Nina event.](http://i55.tinypic.com/2ev5fg5.jpg). There is a large negative anomaly along the equator and a positive anomaly around Indonesia.

One more thing I'd like to highlight, is that the deep ocean water, that is being upwelled along the South American coast , is very Nutrient rich. Meaning during La Nina events there is more biological activity going on, since more algae/plankton can bloom which is eaten by fish. So during La Nina there are big fish swarms. But during El Nino events the upwelling is significantly reduced and most of the water is nutrient depleted. The surface ocean is almost dead during this time and there are no big fish swarms. Together with large storms common during El Nino it makes the life of fisherman down there quite hard.

Last but not least. Even though El Nino has been pretty much public knowledge for a while now, even far away from South America, there is much that is unkown. We are not very good at predicting it and we don't have much data going back.

[],DefsNotQualified4Dis,,physics,[],,Solid-State Physics | Condensed Matter | Solid-State Devices,dark,text,t2_1f6ihges,False,,"[""Quantum teleportation""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) is a topic in physics which has definitely benefited greatly from a well chosen name as it certainly invokes a set of very exciting - let's be honest - misconceptions about what the topic is actually about. To get the obligatory most common misconceptions out of the way upfront: Quantum transportation is not about sending any objects anywhere and it cannot be used for faster-than-light communication.

Rather, in a sense, quantum teleportation is about solving a problem that quantum mechanics creates that most people would probably never had known was a problem to begin with. In other words, the research is about studying the best the universe allows for a process that you probably assume can actually be done perfectly, but which actually can't. 

Let's say one actually WAS trying to make a Star Trek-esque teleporter. The basic idea would probably be to scan the ever-living hell out of an object at one place, then send all that data to somewhere else using something like a regular 'ole radio signal and then the person at the other end would have the world's best 3D printer and make a perfect copy of that object based on the specifications laid out in the data. Based on that idea you'd assume the primary difficulties are the precision of the scanning and the quality of the 3D printer. The easy part is the transmission, we've had radio for over a century.

Well, it turns out that's not in the cards... ever. Such a scanner can never exist, ever. However, quantum physics does allow a small consolation prize, which isn't quite as good, and that's called quantum teleportation. In an extremely hand-wavy nutshell, it DOES allow scan+send to bundled together as one thing that allows you to in some sense ""push"" the state of something in one system ""onto"" another system IF one has the aid of both regular classical communication (like a radio system) and a helpful friend at the other side with the right set-up and equipment. And that's important thing to understand, before quantum physics rained on our parade we were sending the information classically (i.e. radio signally). To send the quantum information ""quantum mechanically"" we also need that classical communication channel. We need to conspire through regular means to push the transfer of said state through. But as a result, one can push the state with only two teeny weeny compromises: 1) you have to destroy the thing at the point of origin (sorry, ya gots ta die), and 2) you never actually get to find out what the information was that you sent. So you see, what seemed CONCEPTUALLY straight forward, though obviously an engineering of outrageous proportions, is down-graded such that the scan+send was bundled in to a shoddy poor-man's version that at least has *most* of the same end results in terms of getting the state over there.

Now, let's be absolutely clear.  The ability to do this quantum state transfer or ""information-push-with-the-help-of-a-friend-at-the-other-end-I'm-talking-to-classically"" is independent and unrelated to scanning and or 3D printing. Which we originally thought would be the hard part, this helps us nothing with that. All it's about is RECOVERING the transmission part after having our hopes initially dashed about what it means to measure and transmit such information.

Which brings us to the last point: what is the point if it's not about Star Trek transportation, what a scam!? Well, it's true. As I said, such work which started by ""pushing"" a state across the river Danube in Vienna and escalated to between two tropical islands and has recently escalated further to pushing to a satellite in space (Google Anton Zielinger, btw, he's the big guy in all these experiments and definitely has a Nobel Prize coming) really has nothing to do with sending matter anywhere. However, sending quantum information from one place to another without physically moving quantum objects from one place to another is a fairly necessary requirement for some applications of quantum computers and quantum cryptography. It's also something of an escalating demonstration of our ability to reliably set and measure quantum states.",1563375921,{},eu1urxn,False,t3_ce7tf0,False,True,t3_ce7tf0,/r/askscience/comments/ce7tf0/time_magazine_article_says_scientists_just/eu1urxn/,1563375922.0,9,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,1563462318.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],auraseer,,,[],,,,text,t2_4qyql,False,,"This is due to medication safety. If you take too much at once, you can overdose. 

One way to think about this is a concept called the Therapeutic Index, or TI. That number is the minimum toxic dose divided by the minimum effective dose. 

That is, it's very roughly ""If you take this many doses at once, you'll be poisoned."" 

A low TI means that the amount of drug you need to take to have an effect, is pretty close to the amount that will hurt you. In other words, it's easy to overdose or become poisoned. High TI means the opposite, that it is safer, and harder to cause toxicity. 


One example of a drug with a high TI is ibuprofen. The body tolerates high doses of ibuprofen relatively easily. We can prescribe a big dose of ibuprofen all at one time, so you don't need another dose for 8-10 hours. And if you accidentally take a bit more than that, you are unlikely to suffer significant harm. 

On the other end of things is acetaminophen (aka Tylenol or paracetamol). That has a quite low TI. The recommended dose lasts about 4 hours, but if you try to take multiple doses of that at once, the level of the drug in your bloodstream can become dangerous. The high concentration can cause permanent liver damage, and too much can easily be fatal. 

So, in order to figure out dosing, scientists look at both the half-life and the TI (and a bunch of other safety data). They work out a compromise dose, high enough to last a few hours and be convenient, but low enough to be safe.

Also, totally unrelated to all that:

Sometimes drugs come in Extended Release tablets. Those are designed to stick around in your system, dissolve very slowly, and release the drug at a controlled rate over time. 

If you take an 80 mg extended release tablet, maybe you get a trickle of 5 mg per hour into your system.

It seems to vary by drug (haloperidol on the high end, quetiapine on the lower end.)

Most of the deaths in clinical trials were from cardiovascular or infectious causes, and the mortality increase seems to show up pretty quick. This is interesting because most of the concerns with second-generation antipsychotics are more chronic. Their tendency to cause weight gain/insulin resistance/hyperlipidemia has been known for a long time, but these are things that raise your risk of death over the course of months to years; you'd expect the heart attack and stroke risk to increase only in patients who were on them for a long time. The fact that pneumonia was increased suggests there's probably a specific effect on swallowing (bad swallowing causes aspiration, which causes pneumonia.) This might be because antipsychotics can do things to muscular control and swallowing involves complex muscular control, or perhaps as simply as by causing dry mouth. The short-term increase in strokes has many potential explanations but no really solid ones. Falls leading to injury are an obvious answer but this doesn't seem to be as big a contributor as I would have guessed.

The Marianas Trench is a subduction zone, where one tectonic plate is diving underneath another one. Subduction zones are all pretty big, and quite detectable with a satellite - you can see them on any good topographic map of the oceans. All of the deepest points of the oceans that we have found this far occur in subduction zones. Since we know where subduction zones are, it is fairly intuitive to go measure those areas to see how deep they are, and which one is the deepest. No other area in the ocean is likely to be as deep as you'd find in a subduction zone .

Well, your reasoning would be good, but the data shows the opposite.

By scanning with a low resolution still give a good idea about the sea floor. Like with ground, you can still find some places of interest with the low res scan, then return there with a better scanner and scan in higher resolution.

For example, do you really need to hires scan the flat sea floor? All you would see is... flatness...

Also, it is not just a hires and lowres scanner, there is many resolutions possible. Scan in low res, identify some points where it could be interessing, scan in mid res, identify some more precise points, scan in higher res, pinpoint what you want to scan, and high res scan it.

[],jaaval,,neuro,[],,Sensorimotor Systems,dark,text,t2_otn0l,False,,"The question is not easy and involves lots of things we do not yet know. However i'll try to provide some basic answers. In general neurons do not process information. Neural networks do. A neuron just fires if excitatory input is above firing threshold.   Neural networks process infromation by turning some input to some output. A mathematician would say that a neural network can approximate an arbitrary function. Meaning it can learn to map any input to a relevant output. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; What anatomical differences are there that allow parts of the brain to be specialized? 

&amp;#x200B;

The most prominent part of the brain is the neocortex. There are not really obvious differences between different parts of the cortex. The specialisation mainly arises from connections. The nerves from your eyes connect to certain areas of your brain (namely V1 in the occipital lobe) and that part specializes for visual input. Neural networks are really flexible so if you would connect something else there it would probably learn to process that information (in fact this has been done and often for example with blind people the visual areas start to activate for tactile and auditory input). So if you can get meaningful input to a neural network it can learn to do something with it. The sensory data advances through layers of processing. Each layer has it's specialization determined by what it gets as an input.

&amp;#x200B;

So the neurons are not necessarily different but they are wired to handle different things. There are of course different neurons. Some use different \[neurotransmitters\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter)), some are very \[large\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje\_cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_cell)) collecting inputs from thousands of other cells and some are very \[small\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar\_granule\_cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_granule_cell)) only taking a small number of inputs but the main functioning is still similar. Neurons form networks. Different networks produce different functions.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;How does a reward circuit differ anatomically from emotional processing, personality, memory, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Reward circuit is a bit of a simplification. There is a loop of neural connections between the thalamus, basal ganglia and cortical areas which is connected to e.g. motivation and attention. This is a network that modulates processes in other systems. You can think of it like the output from this system opening and closing other connections to affect how you react to things. This loop mainly uses dopamine as a transmitter. Nucleus accumbens is often talked as the reward center because it reacts to highly pleasurable inputs. it seems to modulate at least motivation.

Emotions is a difficult question because honestly we are not really even sure what they are. I personally think they are mostly a response to how comfortable you are in a situation in a deep primal level and difference between different emotions comes largely from context. Also there is no reason to assume different emotions are in any way connected or similar even though we classify them all as emotions. What we call love can be driven by a completely different system than what we call fear. Amygdala is active in many emotional situations. There are wires connecting your sensory inputs to amygdala even before primary cortical processes which suggests emotional responses to situations are very quick and not modulated by cognition. However i want you to note that when i say ""amygdala is active in emotional situations"" i really mean something like ""it seems there is more blood flow to amygdala when we show scary pictures to the research subjects"". We have only very limited methods to study these things.

Memory is also more complicated. You have a short term working memory which is basically just an activation loop that lasts a few seconds. This is how you remember immediate things. Like if you read a word you can repeat it without looking. Because the activation it causes is still in the loop. There is a structure called hippocampus which creates this loop. Long term memory is a bit more complicated. It is thought that long term memory is stored in the very structure of the cortical networks. We know this is controlled by hippocampus but that the hippocampus itself doesn't store the memories, just helps in forming them. We know this because damage to hippocampus doesn't cause patients to lose all memory but prevents them from remembering anything new. The standard idea is that hippocampus consolidates the short term memory to a cortical structure using some sort of repetition process. This way less relevant things are dropped and only those things that are actively in your mind are remembered. However this model has also been \[challenged\]([http://news.mit.edu/2017/neuroscientists-identify-brain-circuit-necessary-memory-formation-0406](http://news.mit.edu/2017/neuroscientists-identify-brain-circuit-necessary-memory-formation-0406)).

However memory is actually even more complicated than that because what i just described is just the episodic memory (i.e. remembering events). You have separate systems for remembering for example motor skills (what you would probably call muscle memory). The main area for this is the cerebellum. You can think of it as a separate movement processor. Your mind tells your cerebellum to execute a movement program and it tells the muscles how to move. If you have never thrown a ball you might have to think about it a lot, ""now i swing the arm and now i release at the right time"". But when you have done it many times you just throw without thinking. This learning happens at the cerebellum. Again there is no big difference between the cells. They are just wired to different places. Cerebellum takes input from your sensory and motor cortices and outputs back to the motor cortices and to the body. Cerebellum looks a bit different than the rest of the brain because the surface is very tightly folded. It forms independent systems for your motor functions and processes things mostly feedforward. i.e. it takes a command from the brain and sensory nerves and turns it into muscle action but this doesnt involve feedback loops in the cerebellum. To show how important the motor functions are for us and how complicated the control system is it should be noted that the cerebellum contains more neurons than the rest of the brain combined. If you know about artificial neural networks, the motor control network in cerevellum would have a smallish input layer, many very large hidden layers and a small output layer.

I wouldn't trust that prediction too closely though - assuming the result does hold, clearly there's something significantly wrong with our cosmological models, so until we have a better idea of what's missing or incorrect in the models, I think it's premature to try and guess how big a correction will be needed.

Transistor counts *have* continued to increase exponentially up to the present day, and this is a big part of why we have gotten the improvements in power efficiency, cost, cache sizes, and multi-core parallelism that you talk about. But, clock speeds and processor architectures haven't improved much since 2005 or so. What this means is that the chip makers have been successful in pushing Moore's Law but they haven't been able to translate those transistor counts into sequential performance the way they used to be able to. 

Sequential processing performance in 2019 is moderately better than what we had in 2005, but not amazingly better. If you're lucky, maybe up to 10x better depending on what application you're trying to run. 10x sounds like a lot, but if you look at the 15 year time period between 1985 and 2000 there's about a 1000x (one thousand times) performance improvement, which in terms of processors is comparing early generation Intel 386 processors to late generation (1GHz) Pentium III processors.

If your application is not algorithmically parallelizable, which is the case for a lot of important applications, then you probably haven't seen many performance improvements in the last 15 years.  Even if your application is parallelizable, parallelization is still challenging for many programmers, and intelligently architecting large systems with parallelism is a big challenge, especially if your application wants to make any kind of service-level guarantees.

Power isn't as big of a concern here on Earth, as we can build massive power plants to power both the computation and the cooling.  We can circulate super-cooled water through a data centre here on earth and dump the heated water back where it came from very easily and relatively cheaply -- but doing that in space would be extremely costly.

Assuming the energy the blast can convey is comparable to a modern rifle bullet, we can say that it's about 2kJ. A good enough lethal force. That's the energy of a blast, that's the energy that the gun provides, the energy of all photons emitted.

The impulse then will be p = E/c = 2,000 J / 300,000 km/s = 6.6712819 × 10^-6 m kg / s.

[],YaztromoX,,computing,[],,Systems Software,dark,text,t2_ngsr1,False,,"The reason why pseudo-random numbers are called ""pseudo-random"" is that in general, if you know what the seed input(s) to the function are, you should be able to predict the value being calculated.  We generally presume that for most uses the fact that the seed input values are stored in RAM are sufficient (which is why pseudo-random numbers are still useful), but if you know the seed input and the algorithm used to generate the random numbers, you can predict what numbers will be generated next.

To generate a number truly randomly, you need a truly random source of input.  Whereas pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) use algorithms to generate random numbers, a true random number generator (TRNG) will measure physical phenomena in the environment, and will use that data to generate truly random numbers that cannot be predicted.

There are a variety of methods for a TRGN to generate truly random numbers.  One easy to understand method to generate a hardware random number (which isn't used in practice, but I'll get why in a minute) would be to create a machine that simply flips a coin, and which can optically determine whether it is heads or tails^0.  It can then assign each possibility to a binary digit (i.e.: heads is 1, tails is 0), and then simply repeatedly flip the coin as many times as needed to get a random number of however many bits are desired (i.e.: if you want an 8-bit number, flip the coin 8 times).  You now have a very simple to understand and use, TRNG.

The problem with this specific TRNG (and one that impacts all TRNGs to differing extents) is that flipping coins is slow, and generating enough ""bits"", especially for algorithms that may be requiring a lot of random numbers (such as in Monte Carlo simulations) is going to slow down computation.  In the real world, other easier to measure and faster systems are in place, such as those that use quantum properties (such as measuring radioactive decay), thermal properties, atmospheric noise, radio noise, etc.

As an aside, while coin flipping is considered to be unbiased (i.e.: it generated heads and tails at equal rates), this may not be true of other methods, such as measuring radioactive decay.  In the case of radioactive decay, you might find that the decay events happen infrequently compared to no-decay events.  To combat this, physical properties that have a bias towards one result over another go through what is known as a ""whitening"".  John von Neumann proposed one of the first whitening algorithms, which is rather easy to visualize:  you read in a pair of biased random bits.  If both bits are the same, you discard them (and return nothing).  If the two bits are [0,1], you return 0.  If the two bits are [1,0], you return 1.  Such an algorithm will rid you of whatever bias may be present in your physical measurement system.

As somewhat indicated above, the big problem with TRNGs is that they tend to be somewhat slow, and it can take some time to build up a sufficient number of bits for certain types of tasks.  For algorithms and tasks that require a lot of processing speed _and_ good random numbers, it's often best to combine a TRNG with a PRNG, such that the TRNG produces bits to act as the seed into the PRNG at regular intervals.  Thus for example, if you have a TRNG that can generate 100 random bits per second, but you have a process that requires 10 000 random bits per second, you could use the TRNG to provide the seed for the PRNG, use the output from the PRNG in your algorithm, and then every few seconds as you re-generate a sufficient pool of bits from the TRNG, re-seed the PRNG with bits from the TRNG (if the PRNG takes exactly 100 bits as a seed, you could re-seed the PRNG once every second).

I hope this helps!

Telomeres are distinct structures.  They look very different from euchromatin (actively expressed) parts of the gene.  They must be replicated with the rest of the genome in somatic cells, but developing cells tend to have active telomerase instead of the canonical DNA polymerase that extends the ends using a circularized RNA template.  This mechanism is inactive in cycling ""mature"" cells and telomeres shorten over the course of sequential cell divisions.  

Yes, transcription/expression is highly regulated.  The histone proteins that DNA wraps around can be modified to selectively increase or decrease expression.  This is one of the mechanisms by which cells differentiate and acquire unique characteristics.

[],CyriousLordofDerp,,,[],,,,text,t2_sudlw,False,,"Generally depends on the star and its magnetic field, but for the purpose of this answer I'm sticking with Sol.

First, to understand what a sunspot is and the underlying mechanisms.

A sunspot is a region of the sun where its sub-surface magnetic field has become twisted and knotted, then forced through the surface. The reason for this is that the sun, being a non-solid object, has different rotation rates. Its equator rotates once every 25 days, while the poles rotate once every 33 days or so. Magnetic fields like to stick with the plasma that's generating them, so with the difference in rotation, the magnetic fields start twisting and stretching around the sun. As stress builds up, the fields start twisting and generally becoming a tangled mess. At high enough field strengths, the field will start suppressing photosphere convection beneath the region. This in turn cools it, creating the dark spot.

Think of it like a rope or piece of wire. You can twist it back and forth a bit, and it will still mostly remain straight. But if you twist it too much, it'll try to loop back on itself to reduce the torsional stress. When this happens on the sun, a variety of magnetic phenomena occur, such as coronal loops.

Now, the size thing depends on how much energy is locked up in the exposed magnetic field, and how complex the field is. A simple up and down magnetic field (I believe its an alpha magnetic field) is not complex at all, and generally has 1 area where one side of the magnetic field is quite dense, producing a spot, while the other end is dispersed over the solar surface, producing little to no spots. These fields generally have a small amount of energy, are very stable, and once spawned generally spend their lives not doing much, maybe some light flaring if they get moody. At largest they're about the size of Earth.

 As more energy collects below and builds, the sunspot grows and its magnetic field becomes twisted, with regions condensing and trying to mix together. As the magnetic field strength grows, the spot also grows as more and more convection below is suppressed. This energy wants out, it wants to be released. If the magnetic field lines from one internal part reconnect with a lower energy set somewhere else, the difference in energy is violently released in a Solar Flare. If the energy is being released slower than what is building below, the sunspot continues to grow until it reaches equilibrium. 

This leads to the meat of the question. How big can sunspots get? Your average sunspot is about the size of earth. A big one will reach Neptune sized. The monster sunspots are all the size of Jupiter or a bit larger. There's also sunspot chains, elongated regions on the sun where sunspots form in groups and clusters, and can be many tens if not hundreds of thousands of kilometers long. Large sunspot regions can last for many months, and present a threat to Earth-based space assets and astronauts each time they make a pass.

NASA also has the data archive for the Solar Dynamics Observatory freely available for perusal. You can input a range of dates, and the archive will spit out the images within that date range.

However, the predictions of the impact are usually not all that exaggerated.  When The Big One hits, it will be catastrophic in ways that will dwarf most natural disasters we've dealt with.  I think the general belief is that it will be worse than Katrina, partly because Seattle metro population is 4x New Orleans metro population, the quake will affect Portland and Vancouver in addition to Seattle, and the swath of coast affected by the tsunami is huge (northern CA to Vancouver).

That tsunami itself will be worse than any flood the US has seen.  One emergency management expert says basically everything west of I5 is wiped out, but that seems overstated. But certainly everything within a few km of the coast will be hit.  The interior Sound area and Portland won't be affected much by the tsunami, but... well, don't live near the coast if you can help it.  There are of course evacuation plans in place but they're essentially meaningless.

(We vacationed with extended family in Long Beach (WA), and if I'd realized quite where Long Beach was before committing, I'd have gone with a big ol' No Thanks.)

The good news is that The Big One is currently given about a 10% chance in the next 50 years.  I expect to die not having experienced it.

We had a swarm of quakes in the Salton sea years after the 2010 Mexicali quake, which was a big one. Had that quake happened in the LA metro area, it would have been a national emergency.

This might likely be the forces from that quake still reverberating almost a decade later.

[],kaiserbun,,,[],,,,text,t2_385zo,False,,"&gt;a tsunami is not a risk for an earthquake on the San Andreas system

True. There is also some data that suggests that a full scale Cascadia Subduction Zone unzip event resulting in a major tsunami in the North West means that you should probably freshen up your earthquake kit if you live in the San Andreas zone. That's not a guarantee by any means but there appears to be a general correlation between major events on the San Andreas preceded by major events in the Cascadia Zone. Not always true of course. First of all what qualifies as a Major Event aka The Big One? The 1907 San Fran quake was a pretty big deal for us humans, particularly the devastating fire that resulted, and that quake was not heralded by major activity in the NW.

The big thing to remember about the Science trying to pinpoint the Big One is that it is very young. Plate Tectonics theory has been around for less than 70 years. A lot of top geologists back in the early and mid 60's were having a hard time signing on to it. The encouraging thing is that because of the new tech at our disposal and all of this great work going on we are learning a lot about each new event. 

Put another way, granted this was 8 years ago but it's worth it to reflect that one of the ironies of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake-tsunami in Japan was that it happened right in the middle of an international conference on Subduction Zone events that was taking place in Tokyo. Hopefully in the future the top minds on the subject will be able to predict major events with the level of accuracy that will allow them to schedule around the big ones give local officials a little time to prepare.",1559668654,{},epzmpw5,False,t3_bwmr6q,False,True,t1_epz4vgc,/r/askscience/comments/bwmr6q/how_cautious_should_i_be_about_the_big_one/epzmpw5/,1559668656.0,49,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,1560104890.0,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],Busterwasmycat,,,[],,,,text,t2_6iyahx,False,,"Statistics don't work as a sure thing. They are an exercise in descriptive probability.  There is never a certain outcome when dealing with probabilities.  You are talking about the application of statistical conditions based on historical data.  

If we assume that the average is about the same as the median period (the distribution of times between quakes is a normal distribution), then we can say that there would be a 50 percent chance that an earthquake will happen before 200 years have passed since the last big one when the average spacing between quakes is 200 years.  Half the time, that next quake will happen within 200 years of the last one, and half the time it won't.

The nature of time periods (limited to 0 on one end but unlimited on the other) makes it that the average value is typically not as high as the median (50%) value (the distribution is skewed to longer times), so the 50-50 chance that an earthquake will happen usually refers to a longer quake-free period than 200 years (how much more depends on the data, of course).

There will be an earthquake.  Historic activity only gives us a statistical overview of the likelihood of that quake for a time period.  In this example, the idea is that half of the major earthquakes (in the past) happened within about 200 years following the previous one.  There is probably some value like 600 years that would be equal to 90% of all quakes.  There would be another value, such as 1000 years, that would fit all the intervals that we know about.  this is still not a 100% certainty value though.  Just a 99.X% likelihood value.

The exact numbers that would fit a given probability percentage (the years for a given percent likelihood) depends on the distribution of results in the database. I don't know what that would be, but it would not be hard to calculate if I had the data.  Just basic statistics. 

It is probability.  Even the most unlikely thing can happen, although what usually happens is what has usually happened in the past.  People do win the lottery even if the odds of a particular person winning are tiny.  

We cannot tell you when and where there will be a quake based on statistics, but we can say that it is very likely that somewhere in a big region prone to large quakes, and at some decently soon time, there will be one of those big quakes.  I don't consider that to be predicting with accuracy at all.  I see it as pointing out the inevitability of an event. It does not become statistically less likely with passage of time; just the opposite.

Every time you roll a die, you have a 1 in six chance of getting a particular number (let's say a six).  If you rolled the die hundreds of times, you would find that about 1/6 of the results was a six. However, every time you roll the die, you still have that one chance in six, and it is thus possible you could roll the die 100 times and never get a six.  Just very unlikely.  Still possible though.

Same thing with earthquakes.  And floods, really.

The weather forecast doesn't lie to you, you just fail to see it for what it actually is, an imperfect prediction.  They really should say ""Probably"" with every prediction they make, and tell you how confident they are, and if you work in meteorology, you can see those confidence values in the raw reports,. The weathermen simply don't bother to tell us what they are, because most people wouldn't understand anyway.

I kind of get what you're saying, but I think it's very misleading.

It isn't a question of whether it can be done, but if it's worth it. Raising clock speed incurs a lot of penalties elsewhere, primarily in power usage and heat generation. Heat generation is usually expressed as TDP in watts*. All other things being equal, if you raise the clock speed you will increase power draw and heat generation. This means you need beefier power delivery and cooling which increases costs and also feeds back more power draw and heat generation for the system as a whole. 

Heat and power aren't the only considerations though. When you really start to pump the clock speeds you can also run into signal integrity issues. The execution pipeline of a processor consists of many complex circuits that must operate in lock step. If anything were to get out of sync then you start to generate computational errors which will manifest as instability in software. Programs may behave erratically or outright crash. Maintaining signal integrity comes down to the design of the chip and also the fabrication process. This is one of the reasons why companies like Intel and TSMC spend billions of dollars on improving their fabrication techniques and shrinking the feature size. This is also why cooling is important in overclocking, as heat increases so does resistance to the point where it can threaten clock stability. 


Clock speed increases have slowed down, but not stopped, because fabrication processes are not improving at the same rate they once were. This was the easy solution to raising clock speeds. Every new process would usually shrink the feature size by half and allow for proportionally less voltage to run the processor. Moore's law is dead and has been for awhile now so while there are improvements in process tech it is slowing down. Intel originally planned to roll out their 10nm process in 2016. Today it has only been used in a few mobile chips.

I've been doing a lot of reading recently about this and have come across the question of projective representations of symmetry groups. This is my understanding so far: the Hilbert space has to support a representation of the symmetry group, except that the elements of the group can also be associated with an additional phase. (I've usually seen these notated as c(g1, g2).) These phases cannot be randomly picked since they have to in the end be consistent with the overall group structure, and this restricts possible choices for the final group that ends up being represented on the Hilbert space. In the example of SU(2), the phase picked up is of π after a rotation of 2π, hence the double-covering of SO(3). Would you say my understanding so far is correct?

I'm really interested in your last paragraph. Could you give some examples of quantum systems with SO(3) symmetry without spinor representations? Would a particle in a radially symmetric potential count?

""Missing the cache"" is a term that refers to the CPU needing the next bit of data and that bit of data not being ready for it in its cache, and having to retrieve it from RAM, which takes a long time and slows down the work a lot. It turns out that most modern programming languages, so an alarming portion of software we're running today on the web and on desktops, handle memory automatically, and often in ways that are apparently prone to cache misses. That's why high performance games tend to stick to languages like C++ for the core of engines.

Neither security nor legislation has become mature since the start of the information age. If you believe you are more secure on an opensource platform simply because it is open-sourced then you're delusional.   


Open-sourced technologies are more secure **in theory**. The idea is that the software is out in the open for anyone to look at, so they will. The truth of the situation is there is a big Venn diagram with different types of peoples:   


* Those who know how to program.
* Those who understand security
* Those who understand project X
* Those who have either the funding or free time to look at project X.
* Cares to even look at project X even if they met all of the above.  


It turns out that the intersection of all of these people is extraordinarily small.  


LineageOS for the FairPhone literally has around 50 unique contributors, **ever**. Of these contributors, around **ten** have made any significant contributions. Worse, if there are any security vulnerabilities that need to be fixed, one of these people will have to fix it. These people are not paid and are not required to do anything.  


  
Do you know when opensource software is more secure? Because it is a lot more secure is some situtations... 

  
It's when a large company, armed with hundreds of well-paid developers, chooses to sponsor an open-sourced project. Linux, Cassandra, React.js,  etc.

[],winstonprivacy,,,[],,,,text,t2_1q4edmb0,False,,"Good questions. But first, we don't use VPN as our networking protocols. We actually implement transports using a fast-ACK UDP-based protocol which is slightly chattier than TCP but has much less latency. The tunnel itself is encrypted in AES-128 (strongest we can export out of the US for legal reasons) though we're considering Salsa 20.

\&gt;  Does it sit in front of or behind the firewall? 

The device has a firewall. It's intended to sit outside of any existing firewall. If you want to put a firewall in front of it (or your existing cable modem has one), you can but you will need to open up one port.

\&gt;  How does it know what IP addresses to connect to other Winstons on? 

It finds them through a typical P2P design pattern of bootstrapping and chatter protocol. The first time you turn a Winston on, it will check for a few different static endpoints. These endpoints don't do anything other than suggest other IP addresses that have connected with it in the past. Then your local node will attempt to connect to those in turn until it does so successfully. From that point on, the nodes periodically gossip with each other about other possible nodes.

\&gt;  What stops me from recording where the inbound connection is coming  from, and where it is going to?  I'm assuming the return traffic would  be going to the Winston that initiated the VPN. 

It's an interesting (and theoretical) attack. I'm not sure what you would get out of it as all communications are encrypted though. We're having a pentest conducted by Black Hills Infosec this month and I'll suggest it to them.

\&gt;  How does it handle the traffic cutover?  Is it a smooth transition, like  you replicate traffic over two links for a few seconds between exit  nodes?  How does it impact latency sensitive data streams? 

Deciding when to cut connections is actually pretty complex and took us awhile to get right. We had a big problem early on with this, as it would disconnect streaming services and even caused Echo devices to stutter (I'm not even kidding about that). today it is almost always a smooth transition, unless you bump up against bandwidth limits. The system is designed to prevent this however.

Latency depends on the distance and responsiveness of the remote node. Our current system is typically adding about 40ms, so you'd probably want to whitelist latency-sensitive games. For browsing, that's pretty snappy and you usually experience a net gain in perceived responsiveness due to the amount of junk we block (45% of requests on average). This frees up bandwidth (especially for trackers which saturate your uplink) as well as CPU in your browser because it has a lot less to do.

Notwithstanding the above, there are a number of areas where we would like to do deep dives to improve performance at the kernel, transport and browser levels.

&gt;Where should I start?

&gt;* Waterproofing it is problematic. *No, I didn't say impossible; it's being done, so it's obviously not impossible.* But it's still problematic due to inherent design limitations.

Water proofing *anything* is ""problematic"". 

The edge seal between screen and case is far harder to weatherproof. 

&gt;* It's way bigger than it needs to be, which is a problem when you're trying to make a compact device.

Entirely Irrelevant;

The last multiple iPhones have been *bigger*, not smaller. I don't buy that crap about miniature devices.

Plus, again, no clue what you're talking about. 2.5 mm Jack exists and no one uses it for a good reason, it does need to be that big


&gt;* There is no inherent protection against shorting the pins to each other when connecting and disconnecting, which makes powered applications problematic.

LMFAO, yes, there is.

Please stop lying.

&gt;* No separate power and data pins, which means the utility of the port is limited. 

Holy shit how many times can I say that you clearly have no fucking clue what you're talking about.

You have no fucking idea how digital and analog signalling works, please stop trying to bluster your way through like an ignorant fool.

You turn the volume up, dumbass.

&gt; What if you want a tiny display on the cord displaying the current track or the incoming caller ID? 

Once again you have no clue what analog means.

&gt; Supercede: take the place of (a person or thing previously in authority or use); supplant.

There's a lot going on in this paragraph.

First, when I say ""sync"" I don't just mean file sync. Obviously you can get file sync from lots of places. I mean contacts/calendars/etc, plus things like browser state, message state, etc. 

Second, the un-upgradable storage in a Mac laptop doesn't really change your calculus w/r/t the need for backup and sync. If the drive fails, it doesn't matter if it's soldered on or not -- you lose your data unless you have backup. That's true of ANY system.

It's absolutely true that companies like Dell, that give a shit (sorta?) about the Enterprise market, have next-biz-day repair programs, but they're not cheap. I wish Apple had one. I'd buy it. This one definitely goes to Dell.

That doesn't mean there aren't lemons or problems. It means that, overall, in the whole population of systems, they're less frequent.

I just took delivery of a new rMBP. I mostly work at home these days, so I was prepared to be meh on the keyboard, esp vs. the one on my supposedly-high-water-mark 2015 model, but you know what? I like the feel better. The 2015 keys are mushy by comparison. The keyboard reliability issue is obviously a big black mark for Apple; it's probably their biggest misstep in the last 20 years. But I'm optimistic they'll recover here -- I mean, they're not dumb.

[],someone755,,,[],,,,text,t2_l2bg8,False,,"Well the thing is your partition size is static. I might only use 1.4G of the 5.8G that the system partition takes up on my phone, but that doesn't result any gains in my data partition. In theory you could resize it, but really the last time I remember doing that was on phones running/launching with gingerbread (where all you got was 4GB of internal memory, and the system partition took over half of that -- or, on another phone I got in 2012, the internal storage was plenty, but the partition scheme was too antiquated to run Marshmallow or newer, so you had to play with partition schemes to flash newer ROMs). The only reason I bother with modifying the system partition at all (and I'm a statistical anomaly here) is because I like backups, and I don't like backups where 80% of the backup is the system. 

The thing with boot animations is that it's not even a video. It's really just a bunch of images, all uncompressed bitmaps the same resolution as your display. For me on my custom ROM, that's less than 5MB, but it's also mostly black and the display is 720p, so I can't tell you about how it scales. You should be able to find it in /system/media even without any special permissions (given that you have a good app, or can work a terminal and 'ls'). Ringtones are actually saved on the disk, because generating music on the fly is... kind of difficult. Still, only 10MB or so.

The drivers, don't get me started about the drivers. You have a whole zillion of them in the kernel, which is saved on the boot partition, which takes up 20M at most. Really, 547M of my system partition is just system apps, and I'm on a lean-ish custom ROM. That leaves 700MB free, of which the system fonts take up 50M, and the OS framework 43MB. Still some 600M, which are mostly just drivers. And believe you me, these things suck. You get some blob file that takes up 32M on its own, and you get several files like this. What specifically they're all for, I have no clue, but the thing here is, your phone has a LOT of hardware. From radios to cameras to a bunch of big ones that take care of the graphics (these latter ones are the ones that take the most space, at least on the Qualcomm devices I've owned -- qcom is very secretive about these). 

The apps you install can only use the connections the drivers make available, because apps can't repurpose hardware. Compatibility standards are also fucked up because people just don't care and there was a period when buying a $20 USB-C cable could burn your phone down, literally -- And this was with a big organized thing like USB! Nobody regulates fuck on Android, and even if they did, the driver has to support whatever you're trying to do with the hardware. Your USB port might look like all shiny and ready to take a big fat OTG thumb drive, but if this functionality isn't written in code, you can plug and unplug your drive until the cows come home.

People don't realize this, but everything about your phone and the way it works is phone side. The only reason these things can adapt to any changes outside, from the wifi frequency to the phone signal and taking photos in the dark with  flash, none of it would work or be able to communicate if some very smart people didn't stop and think ""Maybe I should also write *this* in the code"".

How big is your OS partition after you flash to stock? If I only free 2GB that's not much, but if I can free 6 then that gets useful. I remember that my last phone had a pre-installed weather app, which had 4 nice background rain, wind, sun, and snow animations it could rotate through. That app was 800MB - for some background animations that ran in 10-second loops.

(The rest of the post is rhetorical, not aimed at you. If anything I'd assume you'd share in the rant)

Come on, how much data can the loading animation really be? If the boot animation is pure 60fps 1440p raw uncompressed - the best the phone display has any chance to render - it's only a quarter of that, at most. And it certainly can't pull that bitrate from RAM; the animation is a few megabytes. Ringtones are just above potato quality, and I wouldn't be surprised if many are procedurally generated rather than saved audio. 

And how many drivers does a phone need? It has all its hardware built in, it doesn't need drivers for additional hardware that can't be jammed into the case. And for any connections it has, it either will get an app, or the other device will be made to fit compatibility standards - so that's all on the non-phone side.",1560827308,{},erg5tll,False,t3_c1olug,False,True,t1_eres50c,/r/gadgets/comments/c1olug/sanho_hypercube_adds_usb_and_microsd_storage_to/erg5tll/,1560827309.0,0,True,,False,gadgets,t5_2qgzt,0.0,,,,1560913704.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

ELI5 attempt: so! you generally use flour / sugar / eggs / chocolate to bake a cake, right? But if you are struck with a sudden (and oddly specific) bout of amnesia that makes you forget the word cake, and (somehow) the world depends on you communicating the concept of cake, how do you do that? Just describing flour / sugar / eggs / chocolate won't work. Those ingredients alone could be cake, cookies, croquembouche, brownies, etc. You could go by listing types, 'confetti, vanilla, chocolate' and that would help narrow it down, but your loyal monkey-astronaut friend Bobo (who really only got into the space academy because his dad bought a new wing to the aerospace building) is very stupid, and will only make a guess when he's *nearly certain* about what you're saying (&gt;98%) so you'll really have to narrow it down more. Listing specific quantities of ingredients will be a big help, as well as things like listing where you have cake (birthdays, weddings, etc). Eventually, you'll throw enough stuff out there that Bobo will feel comfortable making the guess you mean cake, and the evil doctor bakenstien's dread army of german-chocolate filled death machines will be thwarted. Or whatever.

ELI5+! This is (although hopefully silly) basically identical to what's happening. The china social credit system is the best example (There aren't widespread US systems that use anywhere near as many data points, and IDK about the UK's london system). China uses facial recognition (ingredients), but as they doubtlessly quickly discovered, it's not that easy. You can get pretty reliable, but facial recognition still fails even with crisp, clear, front-on DMV photos. So they do more! You mentioned gait (closer to what you use to eat the cake), which is commonly espoused (but very easily defeated, a change from boots -&gt; sneakers will cause it to fail and it's a joke with high-heels). But gait combined with conventional facial recognition narrows it down, and it would be trivial to identify one person from a thousand using those two combined methods alone.

The real sinister bit that china does, what makes their system have what I suspect is a nearly non-existant failure rate, is realtime tracking. They don't run facial recognition 100% of the time. They identify you once, then keep track of your location in realtime. If you go on a bus or some other obscured area, they only have to run their identification algorithms once to sift through the handful of people that have gotten on the same bus as you. Instead of picking your face out of the crowd, they're picking your face out of the few-dozen-or-so people on the same bus. Once you're off and re-ID'd, they go back to keeping tabs on your location. *that's* what's so effective, not the fairly grandiose facial recognition ability the CCP claims, but the proven ability to keep track of all those individuals. Combine it with realtime positioning data from cellphones and I can't see an easy way of defeating that system.

So, what does it mean for folks *not* in china?

The US doesn't have nearly the coverage that china does, nor the interest in maintaining that level of control over it's citizens. This means we don't have to worry about unavoidable location tracking, just standard facial tech (which is easily defeated with liberal ordinary makeup, let alone the fancy cyberpunk styles). Downside, the US definitely does get realtime data from cellphones, and the ubiquity of phones means that's fairly unavoidable. 

Getting the more cyberpunk styles to the mainstream and putting a custom rom on your phone that hard disables google telemetry is the standard-redditors best plan to avoid this. I was at a talk recently about this subject, and the presenter described the best defense as 'security through uniformity'. The general idea is, if one person wears wild makeup to defeat facial tech, they're going to be super easy to find (""hey did you see a KISS reject go by here?"") but if bunches of people start wearing similarly-styled makeup, it's almost impossible to keep tabs on them through cameras alone.

[],22Sharpe,,,[],,,,text,t2_ydcy1,False,,"The sensor is what actually captures the image. Sorta like how in old film cameras the shutter opened to expose a frame of film; the sensor replaces the frame of film in digital photography. So the sensor is exposed to light and that’s what creates the photo. In very simplistic terms a bigger sensor is capable of hiking onto more pixels and pulling in more light. Phones have tiny sensors so fit into their tiny bodies. People below have explained how this all works better than me.

The reason they don’t tout the sensors is probably two-fold. First: sensors don’t really get upgraded much so there’s less to tout. Second, and more importantly: sensor stats are more complicated and convoluted. People like big numbers because big numbers are always better right? Say saying it has 64MP sounds amazingly impressive even if the sensor can really only pull in 16MP worth of data.",1558710307,{},eone74i,False,t3_bsfbnm,False,True,t1_eondtha,/r/gadgets/comments/bsfbnm/the_first_phone_with_a_64megapixel_camera_will_be/eone74i/,1558710308.0,3,True,,False,gadgets,t5_2qgzt,0.0,,,,1559313618.0,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],GreenStrong,,,[],,,,text,t2_3am5e,False,,"&gt;For example, in low light conditions, a 64MP sensor could ""combine"" data from 4 pixel squares and treat them as 1 pixel, resulting in a 16MP image that has good detail and quality even in low light. But in sunny conditions it could utilize all 64MP to make very detailed photos. I think it might turn out really great.

That's exactly what this camera will do.  The overall sensor size is still small, so the amount of optical diffraction at the lens aperture will be significant.  The signal to noise ratio at those sensor sites will be lower, so the image will be noisy compared to something like a DSLR with a big lens and a big sensor, but this is an incremental improvement.  It may be the best phone camera ever; it won't rival a 16 megapixel DSLR you can pick up used for $250.

One of the early Nikon DSLRs had automatic downsampling; I think it was the D1H, their first digital high speed camera for applications like sports.  It was advertised as a four megapixel camera, but the results were very good.  It was later revealed that it actually had 16 megapixels, and it automatically downsampled.

That said, I don't trust these alleged speeds for 1 second. Spiderman specifically used a rather special method for streaming and this new system may just have the resources to preload/buffer a bunch of data that is assumed to be used once the user actually starts playing so while they're in the main menu, the game is just loading a bunch of common assets to RAM/VRAM so the actual black screen is a lot shorter. But SSDs are incredible and cannot be downplayed. I've been using them since Windows XP. Mechanical hard drives are utter garbage.

[],PaxDramaticus,,,[],,,,text,t2_te381,False,,"I don't mind criticizing the writer's approach, be it an old-fashioned conceptualizing of masculinity or whatever. After all, one of the big problems we have to deal with in nearly every facet of English-speaking civilization is how historically male voices were treated as though they were the default voice, so it's useful to have periodic reminders that something that reads weird today doesn't necessarily read weird because it's old, so much as that it reads weird because it comes from a place of weird performative masculinity. A genuine response to a book by someone who has read the book, regardless of their point of view, is something I can appreciate.

What I don't get about this listicle is the ""cult/cool"" angle - To describe a book as ""cult"" is to say it had strong appeal that was not mainstream. But it looks to me like only for two items on the list, *The Beach* and *Infinite Jest,* does Anderson make an effort to analyze what appeal the book originally had in its place and time that made it have cult appeal in the first place, and of those only in *The Beach* do they attempt to give criticism that is relevant to that appeal. Most of their criticism of the books on this list comes down to which subculture is associated with each book and how *they* aren't cool anymore, or about what bad things the author did in life, which, yeah, may well be worth talking about, but in that case doing this in a listicle format as a take down of books with cult appeal doesn't make much sense. It's all so short and low-effort that there's no room for depth.

Cult books appeal to a select group for a reason. If that reason is no longer relevant, it hardly seems necessary to warn people off of the books because no one is reading them anymore anyway. The idea that this is a warning to read current cult faves with a critical eye falls flat if the example is already culturally irrelevant. If people are finding something meaningful in these books despite whatever flaws they have, then the listicle's superficial criticism isn't going to stop people from reading these books and extracting meaning from them. If people find Holden Caulfield's inner struggles relevant, they are not going to care that he comes from a time where problems were solved differently than today. Likewise, we all know which subculture *Atlas Shrugged* appeals to, and I think most of us can agree that the subculture is pretty unappealing to most of us. But though I think it's fair to criticize a political movement built on somewhat covert racism and a science-fiction novel, that doesn't really say anything about the merits of the novel itself or what about it speaks to those people. I can't find sales data for the last few years, but it certainly doesn't seem that for the people who made *Atlas Shrugged* a cult hit, that it has in any way lost that appeal. For Anderson, AS isn't a cult book that lost its cool, it's a cult book whose cult she doesn't like.

It all reads less like a criticism of books becoming fashionable for the wrong reasons, and more like a criticism of the books on the list as definitely unfashionable today. Which, again, doesn't make any sense when the topic of focus is books with cult appeal, because by definition cult fashion is *not* trying to conform to what has mainstream appeal.",1569284557,{},f1a3qo2,False,t3_d84zlf,False,True,t1_f17z5to,/r/books/comments/d84zlf/the_cult_books_that_lost_their_cool/f1a3qo2/,1569287063.0,2,True,[],False,books,t5_2qh4i,0.0,1569284783.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, the collapse on Easter Island was probably caused by the introduction of non-native species as opposed to overlogging, and the Greenlandic Norse probably died out because they adapted *too well* to their landscape, only for those strategies to fail them when the climate shifted.

&amp;#x200B;

The only real issue with Guns, Germs and Steel is that it works from this big picture hypothesis and tries to fit a bunch of different cultures into the same theory. Whereas in reality, Anthropologists seldom find that simple theories can explain broad swathes of human behavior. And not all of the data supports Diamond's conclusions. For example, the Europeans actually had a markedly less sophisticated form of agriculture than most other parts of the world. Moreover, we're finding that human's abilities to respond to environmental pressures can actually be quite impressive. For example, there's an amazing case in the Amazon where people were using turtle aquaculture to make up for the low-nutrient soil.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's also plenty of stuff to praise about *Gun Germs and Steel.* Studying how environmental pressures shape societies is a big area of research in Anthropology right now, so I appreciate how Diamond opted to use that very contemporary lens. I also applaud Diamond for challenging the idea that Europe rose to prominence due to cultural superiority, as opposed to structural factors (most of which are actually quite recent). That's obviously something that Anthropologists have been saying for a long time, but Diamond communicated the message in a very easily digestible way, and that's unquestionably a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that Diamond is bad, per se. He's about as good as any general science writer is ever going to get. And we need general science writers, so that's a good thing. Though he is very basic and he lags behind the pace of contemporary research, so reading Diamond doesn't make anyone an expert. Ultimately, I think that Diamond can be great, but you have to read it in context of *what it is*. Honestly, the reason why most Anthropologists get frustrated by Diamond is because we've been cornered at parties by one too many people who read *Guns Germs and Steel* and tried to use it to explain our field to us. That and he has popularized a few sweeping theories that just aren't supported by the available data, *Collapse* being a key example of that).

[],Albion_Tourgee,,,[],,,,text,t2_3005x,False,,"This is totally wrong.  Amazon makes a profit on nearly every book they sell and makes lots of money on the book business.  They are able to mark down print books because they are efficient.  Generally publishers / distributors receive about 45-55% of list price for print books.  The book seller gets the rest.  But the profitability on all sides is severely reduced because bookstores are in the most part a consignment business -- bookstore are allowed to return any books they don't sell.  (Because of the high price of shipping and warehousing, usually ""return"" means ""destroy and get a refund"".) So bookstores not only pay rent on retail space, but they also have lots of return activity that's unprofitable.  Bookstores have a very hard time predicting what books are going to sell (except, runaway best sellers) so that's a problem too.  

Amazon sells mostly on line so no cost of physical storefront, a big savings. But Amazon's also getting into the bookstore business as well -- they have data on what books sell and that's basically how they stock the stores. For me it makes a lousy bookstore, so I don't use it.  But the bookstore can be profitable, because Amazon stocks the books that sell.

Also, unlike most every other bookstore / chain, Amazon generally does not do returns. So they save all the money on useless activity, returning or destroying inventory they can't sell.  Instead, they focus on being better at buying books in quantities that they'll sell.  They're good at this, and it reduces their costs. It does put a burden on publishers who want to do big print runs, because they're used to bookstores overbuying and returning many books; Amazon buys less and doesn't return unsold copies 

Amazon also does a print-on-demand service that's a win-win for authors and small publishers.  They pay a percent of sale price less print cost -- for most books this comes out to about 35% margin for the seller, all in.  By contrast in the traditional bookstore model, the publisher gets about 45-55% of the list price , but has to pay for printing, warehousing, transportation, returns, so the net is much lower than Amazon's POD service.

Because Amazon's costs are lower, it can discount the books. The discount comes out of Amazon's share, so their gross margin per book is less than traditional bookstores.  Also, if they overbuy (usually only a handful of books) they will mark the book down until it sells, so they do lose money on those sales just like a normal retailer who overbuys products and puts them on sale.  But the vast majority of books Amazon sells are profitable, even discounted, because their costs are lower than a traditional bookstore.

Publishers and authors set list prices in the print book business.  But retailers set the actual sale price. Retailers often discount, whether by marking a book down, or in most traditional print book stores, by having loyalty cards, such as every 10 books you buy, you might get a store credit for the 10% of the total price (essentially, a 10% discount to repeat customers).  

Amazon makes lots of money because they run the business more efficiently and use sales data very effectively.  It's hard for a traditional bookstore to compete.  One way that some stores survive is great customer service of a kind Amazon can't match, like a welcoming environment, helpful staff, a meeting place with coffee or a restaurant, etc.  

Barnes and Noble was one of the few chains that actually could have competed with Amazon by using sales data to serve customers and making it a great environment for readers.  But, for example, instead of using the prime space in the stores (like tables in the front) for the benefit of customers, it required publishers to pay for prime space in the store.  (Like grocery stores usually do)  It punished small publishers, for example, by overbuying books and then returning a very high percentage.

If you have two groups of any suitable size, you will find significant differences between groups based on sheer ""n""s. P value means ""How likely is this to have occurred based only on chance?"" (which is already kind of twisted if you spend any time thinking about this... You KNOW that this is the result you got and we are estimating how likely the result is given no effect). Effect size literally just means ""how big is the difference""? That's really, really important. 

We are basically at a point where NO social science intervention research is publishable without an effect size because it is the thing that says, ""Oh yes, this matters"". Otherwise, a huge study might find a statistically significant result that is so small that it is not clinically significant. I work with really big data sets and that is super relevant in my work. 

What you are citing is not actually critiques of the concept of effect size (note for the podcast one, I read the cited paper and did not listen to the podcast). They are essentially critiques of meta-analysis done badly, which is why meta-analysts publish thoughtful protocols and why we have the peer review process. Both meta-analysis and primary research can be done badly, but I see a hell of a lot more of the latter than the former. Saying ""This can be done in a way that is meaningless"" would be an argument against the existence of research. 

A critique of meta-meta-analysis (the second two links you posted here), by the way, is two full levels removed from a critique of the concept of effect sizes. The concept of effect sizes is 100% standard practice in social science research. It is literally stats 101. Meta-analysis has important methodological considerations in order to meet rigorous standards-- just like any research. Meta-meta-analysis is NOT considered an acceptable research practice. 

Saying ""effect sizes are bunk"", though, is like saying ""standard deviations are bunk"". It's a comment that suggests pretty profound ignorance of how stats are used and what makes research meaningful. 

For reference, I am getting my PhD in Counseling Psychology with a specialization in quantitative methods and I am a graduate researcher in a meta-analysis lab. 

I am 100% fine if you want to post information about token economies in classrooms that does not support the practice; I have no dog in that fight. But if someone says ""There is a lot of research into how these things mess up motivation and things like that"", it seems reasonable to me to ask about what that ""lot of research"" is.

[],Gordopolis,,,[],,,,text,t2_5bufl,False,,"&gt;In a few weeks, I’ll be retired, and I had every intention of wrapping up my 42-year career in public libraries by writing a sentimental column this month. But, alas, instead of marking the end of four decades in librarianship with a warm and fuzzy feeling, I find myself red-hot over the latest moves by publishers to limit access to digital content in public libraries.

&gt;Until now, I’ve been inclined to give publishers the benefit of the doubt. As co-chair of the ALA’s Digital Content Working Group from 2011 to 2014, back when libraries were working to get basic access to e-books, I came to recognize that some of the restrictions publishers place on libraries in the digital space are business decisions that, to some degree, reflect an economic reality the library community must learn to accept. But recent changes imposed by some of the major publishers have gone too far.

&gt;A year ago, Macmillan placed a four-month embargo on new-release titles from its Tor imprint—part of what the publisher characterized as a “test.” In a series of recent meetings, Macmillan representatives told librarians that the test has validated its belief that library e-book lending depresses consumer e-book sales and author payouts. Speculation is that Macmillan will soon announce new digital terms and pricing for libraries that will include some version of an embargo on new-release titles across more of Macmillan’s imprints.

&gt;Despite holding meetings with librarians (including me), as well as with representatives from the American Library Association, it does not appear that Macmillan has listened to our concerns. Embargoing new releases in libraries is unacceptable. Windowing digital content will place libraries at a true disadvantage at a time when they are already under increasing pressure to serve digital readers and audiobook listeners. Further, libraries are already limited in the digital space. We often pay three to five times the consumer price for two-year access to e-books: terms that dramatically limit the number of copies we can afford to purchase, resulting in long wait times for readers—often many months for the hottest, buzziest titles. Adding an additional embargo period will only extend these already-long wait times for digital readers.

&gt;Part of the problem here is that public libraries have little leverage with which to negotiate digital pricing and terms with publishers and vendors. With physical materials, our ability to buy and lend copies and to create rich collections for our communities is protected by law. In the digital world, however, we can’t license content without agreeing to the terms the publishers set. Yet, neither can we walk away from the digital formats our public is asking for just because the terms and prices are too onerous. That would be counter to our values and mission. And it would signal to our supporters and funders that the library can’t meet the community’s needs. With so much digital content readily available to consumers these days through a variety of commercial platforms, the library story of embargoes, exclusive author contracts with Amazon, and high digital pricing decimating our collection budgets is tough enough to explain to our boards, let alone to our public. This is part of the story, too.

&gt;In another recent setback, Hachette Book Group and Simon &amp; Schuster became the first of the Big Five publishers to meter digital audio purchases in libraries. Like e-books, digital audio licenses from these two publishers will now expire after 24 months. The change comes despite digital audio consumer sales showing strong double-digit sales growth for each of the last six years, with no sign of slowing down. Any objective, reasonable read on the data would suggest that libraries have played a positive role in the growth of the digital audio market, with their collection dollars and in terms of marketing and exposing the format to new consumers.

&gt;“Where will we librarians and library supporters draw the line? When will we say that access terms and pricing have become too oppressive?”

&gt;Both Hachette and S&amp;S said the change in its audio terms was driven by a simple desire to align their e-book and digital audio policies. But you have to wonder what is really driving this change. Meanwhile, as the format becomes more popular, Amazon is growing more aggressive in its tactics. Its Audible subscription service is pursuing exclusive contracts that deny libraries access to some of the most highly desirable digital audio content, including from major authors such as Margaret Atwood and Michael Lewis. And adding another unwelcome twist to the digital audio story, following an exclusive deal with an unnamed “important strategic partner,” Blackstone Publishing last month imposed a 90-day embargo on new-release audio titles in libraries.

&gt;We appreciate that four of the Big Five publishers—Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, and Simon &amp; Schuster—have thus far committed to a no-embargo policy for new-release titles. But the fact remains: high prices and limited term licenses are severely impacting our ability to build collections and serve our communities. Making it all worse, managing these increasingly complex digital licenses requires significant additional expense and time from library staff—resources that could be spent serving users or buying more books from more authors.

&gt;Following its formation in 2011, the ALA’s Digital Content Working Group worked with publishers and vendors to open a dialogue about digital content in libraries. By the end of 2014, all of the Big Five publishers were in the library e-book market. And when the working group’s six-year charter expired in 2017, we had a growing, relatively stable (albeit expensive and complex) library e-book market.

&gt;Recent developments, however, suggest that we are facing a grim future for digital content in libraries. Where will we librarians and library supporters draw the line? When will we say that access terms and pricing have become too oppressive?

&gt;At last month’s ALA Annual Conference, the ALA Council passed a resolution urging ALA to form another working group on digital content, as well as to start a public outreach campaign about the challenges we face in the digital realm. The resolution also urged ALA to approach Congress. I am skeptical that another working group will be effective. By now, we know well the issues and the forces at play. And there is plenty of data to show that working closely with libraries in fact makes good business sense for publishers.

&gt;But I do believe it is time for library supporters to mount a vigorous campaign to communicate widely the challenges libraries face in the digital content market. Last month, the Association of American Publishers filed comments urging the Federal Trade Commission to scrutinize the business practices of the tech industry. Perhaps libraries should take this opportunity to share our experiences in the digital market with government officials as well. Like the AAP and its members, we recognize that Amazon has been a particularly destabilizing force.

&gt;We have reached a tipping point. Access to digital content in libraries is more than a financial issue; it is an equity issue. Ask yourself this: if libraries are effectively shut out of performing their traditional roles in the digital realm, do you trust Amazon to be the public’s open and fair discovery engine?

**""Corporations/private companies can do what they want!""**

These people work too close to government (are directly involved in it) to say for certain that it 'isn't government censorship'. Anyone using the argument ""corporations can do whatever they want"" is clearly ignorant, propping up or directly benefiting from crony capitalism. The Sherman Act was created in the late 1800s-early 1900s to break up holding companies and corporate monopolies during the Trust/Railroad boom. These corporations later got their way and bought politicians to ignore regulation and now, here we are today. ~40,000 people in America die a year because they can't afford healthcare (Private insurance is doing what they want), and Wall Street banker's greedy speculation crashes the market and they force American people to pay for it.

[],ronnyhugo,,,[],,,,text,t2_gmcrk,False,,"&gt; Oh yeah it seems that when that gene is missing the kids are all screwed up. How... odd. Who woulda thunk it?

And you think we'd produce offspring with infertile cell matter as opposed to some that we store for reproductive purposes before the treatment? 

&gt; You're proposing that we target.... individual cells which have ceased dividing... with lasers..... Tell me... how exactly do you plan on FINDING these cells?

You only have to deal with those that are a problem, symptoms help you determine when that is the case. Otherwise you just leave them be. Like we do with senescent cells through 80% of our life with no ill effects. 

&gt; You know what else has a high turnover rate of cells? Lungs.... bone marrow... GI tract. You know... only the things that are 100% necessary for daily life. No big deal. I didn't need a constant production of blood cells anyway.

Do you have any idea how many blood cells can be produced from a finite but initially ""full"" telomere length? The Hayflick limit is between 50 and 70 divisions, or there about. Assuming an initial sample size of a few million (among 37 200 billion total cells) being added to each tissue every few decades, that would be more than sufficient. Smaller sample size is possible as one perfects the treatment (normally a portion dies before they can establish themselves in the tissue in question). 

&gt; Oh and I'm sure I'll enjoy getting the ""cell boost injections"" drilled into my bones every other week!

You have apparently never heard of the bloke who asked for one grain of wheat for the first square on the chess board, two for the second square, four for the third square, eight for the fourth square, etc, until it filled all the squares. The man opposite thought that was a very modest payment, until of course he did the math and found that he was asking for more grains of wheat than you could make with all the atoms in the universe. 
That's how most of your cells can deactivate the telomere-lengthening mechanisms long before you are even fully grown. 

&gt; That's... not... how... cancer.... works..... Cancer isn't a bacteria. It does not mutate nearly as quickly as bacteria do. 

We're not talking about mutation. We're simply talking about selectively killing the portion of cells that happens to be vulnerable to the substance you put into the system which harms cells. Then you let these divide. 
First you provide a drug which kills lets say 90% of the least resistant cells of a certain tissue (other tissue types can be more or less resilient, usually one selects a poison which most heavily affects the tissue type of the cancerous cells). Then the new tumor five years later will consist entirely of the final 10%. Sure this doesn't mean your drug now doesn't kill a single cell, but the effect is measurably smaller. It could be that the cells have an uneven amount of molecular pumps which brings certain molecules into the cells and out of the cells. Which is the case actually, since genetics doesn't go into such detail that they specify in numbers how many of each molecular piece of a cell there should be. As you move from the 10% best survivors to the 1% to the 0.1%, you gradually weed out all the cells which have the molecular tools to even interact with your poison. And even then these cells still have the tools to interact with some number of the molecules of your poison, but its such a small number that actually enters the cell that you'd need to administer a dose which would kill too many other cells in the patient. 

The best analogy would be that you have many very complex shapes of holes on lots of plastic balls, and a certain size and shape chess piece will fit through many of these holes initially. But then as you remove some portion of the ping-pong balls the chess piece could enter, and copy the rest to get back to the original number of balls, then the portion that could interact with the chess piece is now smaller. As you repeat this you are left with fewer and fewer that can interact with your chess piece. No evolution, no change, no mutation, took place. 

You only repeatedly removed the cells that were vulnerable enough to your cancer drug for the non-lethal drug dose to affect them more than the rest of the cells. The other cells in your body will do the same, though because of lots of anti-cancer mechanisms normal cells will divide a lot quicker than cancerous ones that divide in spite of there being no surrounding need for more cells. That's why you can give what is poison, repeatedly to a patient, and have the cancer cell numbers go down quicker than the other important cell numbers. At least until the remaining cancer cells lack the amount of cell mechanisms to interact with your chosen drug in sufficient doses to harm the cancer cells. 

But since you're vividly trying to misunderstand the whole thing, what I can I even say? 

&gt; Basically, your entire treatment revolves around deactivating the gene responsible for extending telomeres, although this has been looked at and dismissed by scientists already as we already know that it causes extreme problems in humans. 

Well the ones who looked at it confidently said that removing the telomere-lengthening mechanisms without doing anything else, would indeed be a very bad idea. What they failed to imagine was that they add to their treatment with forced apoptosis and stem cell treatments. Or maybe they also haven't heard of 2 to the power of n and thought they'd have to administer stem cells every few weeks... I imagine that they just didn't think to implement two completely fields in addition to their own, because they didn't know about those two other fields in sufficient detail. 

&gt; Therefore, your argument is already wrong. As for removing limbs... I'm unsure the last time I saw someone with ""hand cancer"" or ""leg cancer."" Most of the cancers I see are something to do with the... you know... organs.

Yet there are organs we can do without for quite some time. Some we can even do without indefinitely. And many organs can have big pieces chopped out with far less severe consequences than what the second and third generation cancers bring. 

And we have actually grown pieces of organs in the lab. Its not unreasonable to assume that we can replace organs with new organs, grown from tissue from the patient, even before we can perfect this cancer treatment itself. Because currently the proponents of this strategy can't afford to develop it because they can get more funding by doing less costly proof of concept research in the SENS area. 

&gt; Feel free to post actual science to backup your crazy ideas. Until then, don't bother. Your ideas have no validity in the world of science or medicine.

Its not MY ideas. This is the ideas of the SENS research foundation. And the rejuvenation biotechnology field as a whole. I'm sure the prominent researchers who have signed up on their team can provide you with all the data that made them sign up for the ""other team"" in the middle of their careers.

[],corrado33,,,[],,,,text,t2_17cm8i,False,,"I have looked, but what most people have not considered is this.

Farmers use livestock as a way to make more money off of their base product (crops). It'd be the same as a cotton farmer also having a fabric producing business instead of directly selling the cotton. Who are we to tell the farmer that they can't make more money using livestock? Not to mention that livestock are much less affected by things like drought or other catastrophes. 

And now, let's take a look at some other data.

Unlike what most anti-beef sites will tell you, beef cattle are not fed grain their entire lives. Usually the first year of the cow's life is spent in a pasture eating grass or hay or other forage. It's only in the last 6 months or so that they are taken to a feedlot to be fed a specific diet of grains to put on the last few hundred pounds of weight before they are slaughtered. This means that the oft-quoted stat of ""6 pounds of grain per pound of cow"" only really apply to the last maybe 600-700 pounds of the animal. So let's do a bit of math shall we? 

6 pounds of grain with 700 pounds of cow is 4200 pounds of grain. Ok. Cows in my neck of the woods were sold last year for $140 per hundredweight. Now, I'm no farmer, but after some googling that means per 100 pounds, as in imperial pounds, not kilograms or anything like that. So, since these cows weigh... say... 1500 pounds, that's $2,100. Per cow. Ok, now what about 4200 pounds of grain? Cows are typically fed corn, oats, and barley. In my neck of the woods, the most expensive of those is barley, at ~$230 per metric ton. Ok 4200 pounds of grain = 1.9 metric tons of grain, therefore it costs (at most) ~$460 to bulk the cow up in the feedlot. Cows in pasture are pretty cheap, somewhere around $100-$200 a year. So that's a total of maybe $600-$700 for a farmer to raise a cow.... and $2,100 to sell it. 

Now I'm sure my numbers are off here somewhere, but my point is this. There are PLENTY of extraordinarily energy inefficient industrial processes that take raw materials and convert them into higher value products at the expensive of energy use and CO2 production, yet people don't make nearly as big of a deal about them. Why? Because those things are used to make products that THEY enjoy. Their phone, their computer, their house, etc. The only people pushing for this sort of crap is the so called ""animal activists"" and are trying to use the whole ""animals have feelings too"" thing as a ploy to get sympathy on their side. There are much bigger targets out there if people want to save the environment. And sure, 67% of SOME crops are used to feed livestock such as corn (actually it's higher for corn), but overall, if considering ALL crops that the US produces, it's much more like 33% of all crops produced are used to feed livestock.

&gt;The inevitable comparison to ComCast must be made.

What long-dormant part of your brain did you have to travel to to retrieve this fine specimen of a thought?

Comcast limiting access to a certain websites -when they have a literal monopoly in many areas of the US- is in no way relatable to Amazon -a single vendor- declining to peddle borderline illegal publications.

For one, the internet is supposed to be classed as a public utility, much in the way other telecomms are regulated. This type of data traffic is supposed to be entirely unfiltered (unbiased you could say). Contrast that against Amazon, who don't supply any form of public utility, they aren't obliged to supply an unbiased product as it's not essential for our day to day lives for Amazon to stock these types of products, unlike an uncensored internet.

Secondly, as I mentioned initially, Comcast actually holds a real monopoly over vast areas of the US, so to abuse their newfound power over the content of your internet definitely amounts to censorship. Again, contrast that against Amazon; Amazon don't have a monopoly in any specific areas, you can always go shop elsewhere either online or retail for products they don't stock. You aren't prevented from buying the specific product, you're prevented from buy it from Amazon. BIG difference here.

,TheBelleFinch,,,[],,,,text,t2_1d9b1jxh,False,,"Speaking as a librarian, Overdrive is great, but it's not *as great* as you make it sound, and while I'm sure that it does lower piracy somewhat, I can also think of several reasons why it's not going to dissuade ebook pirates signficantly.

The main thing is that, with Overdrive someone in your library system has to own the title as an ebook in order for you to check it out. This isn't usually an issue for big releases but if what you're looking for is older, or a little more obscure, it's not always easy to find. Like I said, that's not going to be an issue for a lot of people, but it does affect people like me who tend to read a lot of very niche stuff and it makes the platform look less attractive on the whole.

Another big issue with Overdrive is the wait. The high price of ebooks means there are generally fewer copies of a book in Overdrive than the system owns in print, often significantly. To use my library system as an example, Marlon James's new novel *Black Leopard, Red Wolf* is getting a lot of buzz, there are 85 print copies in the system, of which 16 are available. You could conceivably have a copy in a few days via interlibrary loan. Total copies in ebook format? Five. The estimated wait time is *twenty weeks.* And this is unfortunately not something that exclusively affects new releases. My girlfriend has a six week wait time on *The Human Division,* the fifth novel in the Old Man's War series which came out six years ago. That's a far cry from a system like Steam where if you want something you can play it (more or less) instantly.

And speaking of the Old Man's War series, let's talk about TOR. TOR, one of the largest publishers of science fiction and fantasy recently announced that libraries would have to wait four months before they were able to purchase TOR ebooks saying that digital lending was having an adverse effect on their sales. 

Now, I have no scientific data to back this up, but I'd wager a gues that a significant portion of the people who are likely to pirate ebooks are scifi readers. Maybe not the majority...but a lot. This is entirely anecdotal but knowing what I know about myself and all the pirates I've interacted with in real life and on the internet it just seems like kind of a safe assumption. That kind of leaves Overdrive users in a shitty position if they want to read newer books by some of their favorite authors: they're going to have to wait four months *at least* to read new releases on top of the time waiting for a copy, and that's undoubtedly going to drive people towards piracy. TOR's described this as something of a pilot program which they may not stick with, but if they start seeing a growth in profits from this it's possible other publishers may suit, which would further hurt Overdrive users. 

Now, this seems overly negative towards Overdrive and while I admit that I'm not crazy about the service myself, it's definitely useful and I'd encourage everyone to use it if they think it's the kind of thing they'd be interested in, I'm just trying to illustrate that there are some pretty glaring reasons why it wouldn't signficantly erode ebook piracy.

The aftermath of the Big Bang. 

&gt; Aren't they matter? Aren't they energy?

They are miasmas of plasma held together by their own gravity.

&gt; At some point you have to admit EVERYTHING had to come into existence or it is eternal!

[Perhaps you ought to try reading the Simple English wikipedia page on the theory.](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang)

&gt; So what exactly is eternal in your universal view?

This is either a nonsensical question or an irrelevant question.  
I have never claimed that anything is 'eternal'; you did that, repeatedly, without evidence.

&gt; Or what created it from nothing?

This is a loaded question; it presumes 'creation' (an act) and 'nothing' (a state), and a separate and distinct 'what' as cause (an additional layer in the causal chain), but there is no evidence to support any such claim.
  
Fun Fact: ""I don't know"" is a perfectly valid answer; ""I know, but I have literally no verifiable evidence to support my claims"" is not.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Eternal means no beginning and no end.

The universe *had* a beginning though, and it would appear to be progressing towards at least a functional 'end'; heat death.  
It thus does not qualify as 'eternal' by that standard.

&gt; Definitions don't really matter at this point in the argument,

Yes, they do.  
To pretend otherwise suggests that you were never sincerely engaging in any sort of legitimate argument, and were instead attempting to throw out abject nonsense in the hopes of deflecting and evading. Presumably you are attempting to defend your ego from acknowledging that you cannot support your claims through either evidence or simple logic.

&gt; you are ignoring the fact that you have no explanation for the beginning of the universe.

I don't *need* one.  
I can understand and accept that, currently, humanity lacks the requisite data to make any sort of assertions about any pre-universe state. I'm certainly not going to make up stories and peddle them as fact; I'm not sufficiently insecure about acknowledging ignorance to do that, as some apparently are.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; You state it comes from chemicals.

Life? Yes, of course it does.  
Or is your knowledge of Biology as lacking as your knowledge of Physics and Chemistry?

&gt; Where are the chemicals from?

You've already been told this.

&gt; Then you say stars.

They *are* thermonuclear fusion engines that generate an abundance of elements throughout their lifespan, yes.

&gt; Where are the stars from?

The aftermath of the Big Bang.

&gt; Before you answer me next, where did THAT come from?

**We** do not know, but it would certainly appear that the universe has not always existed and only came into what we would recognise as 'being' with the Big Bang.  
Assumptions and speculation beyond that are unfounded and irrational.

&gt; You tell me things are moving to an inevitable death of the universe, 

That is what the evidence would indicate, yes.

&gt; but there's an inevitable beginning

*Really?* 

&gt; and you can't explain it without admitting that it came into existence and you don't know how it did.

I think some of your critiques are valid, but at the same time you put a big emphasis on empirical evidence, and have cited sociology and psychology a lot.. these sciences are great and can tell us a lot about how people act as a whole, but science is based on logic. Something else you’ve put a lot of emphasis on.. But individuals are not perfectly logical or rational. People aren’t computers that follow the same protocol for each situation and people aren’t necessarily predictable especially in social situations. In interviews, Robert Greene has said anyone that reads the book and tries to follow all the rules IS a psychopath. It’s not meant to be a handbook, but a distillation if possible tactics that people could use. That’s why there’s a lot of contradictions, it’s a non-linear collection of ideas about power dynamics. You might think about it like emotions. We usually don’t feel one single emotion, but a combination of two or three similar emotions at once. You could feel envy, anger, and contempt all at once for example, and at another time you might feel joy and gratitude at the same time. But you couldn’t feel all of those at the same time, you would be acting crazy and the people around you would surely notice. This translates to the laws: one can’t try to use all the laws at once, because we see right through it. But they might be able to use two or three at one time, another couple at another time, and learn when the situation is appropriate. Just as we learned it’s wrong to feel joy when someone is being hurt, unless you’re a psychopath. 

I also think you may have skewed your perspective by assuming he derived the laws from the historical examples he gave. When he has talked about his process it’s actually the other way around. He read hundreds of books from different fields like psychology and sociology, biographies, and history to identify trends that he distilled into the laws, and then chose historical examples that really clearly illustrated the law at hand to drive home his point. His whole view on writing is that evidence based explanations don’t stick with the reader, but explaining points through story and real life historical examples does.

For you, it sounds like that data based and scientific writing is what you really like, which is great! But for me, it’s a lot of work.

In fact, the year-to-year change over those two years showed that the percentage of sales delivered through B&amp;N, Walmart/Target, and “other” (smaller chains, airport stores, non-bookstores) all fell. The celebrated independent bookstores held their own, at a pretty paltry 6 percent of the sales.
&gt; 
&gt; **But Amazon increased its share substantially, from 38 percent of the print units to 42 percent.**
&gt; 
&gt; So if the original point to the agency strategy was to reduce the power of Amazon, it isn’t working. (This is the case even though “modified agency”, created by the negotiations mandated by the courts after the DoJ sued, restored some discounting capability to the retailers.) **And if the assumption was that increased print sales meant a rise in the power of brick-and-mortar retailing, that is being debunked by the data as well.**

FWIW, that is from a blog maintained by a long-time book industry commentator who is no friend to Amazon.

&gt;  Wattpad announced its intention to publish books chosen by algorithms, foregoing the need for editors altogether. 

Except the link doesn't really say this. Some sort of scanning will occur, but all choices will be made by humans. Finding the needle in the haystack of something publishable with 70 million users vomiting up One Direction fanfic or the like would probably be beyond human capacity anyway.

Its almost like this essay should have been split into two: one on how reading patterns have been changed via the rise of a ubiquitous internet, another on, well, I'm not quite sure what. Possibly the various axes the author has to grind.

On the Metro yesterday I overheard someone saying that the South Bay was seeing more homelessness because some cities in N LA County made it 'basically illegal to be homeless'. (IDK what that meant ordinance-widee precisely, but from what I gathered she was a social services provider? So, legit)

Gathering the data on such a scale would be very resource intensive so infeasible, but I am curious what big picture migration stats (origin point and volume) look like, in this case for Seattle. Like, are Seattle residents with homes becoming homeless, in which case I would also wanna look at worker influx bc of big tech + housing situation -- or are homes coming from other places because they hear that Seattle has resources they can tap into to address tat individual root cause?

&gt;  solve the root of the homeless problem

&gt; Redefining the idea of libraries or whatever is just a band-aid.

I guess it's always gonna seem like a band aid / passing the buck no matter whose responsibility it ends up being, right? So kinda no win there. 

But to your point about addressing root cause -- I wonder what has been done on that front, funding- and personnel-wise?

*Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration* was recommended by a manager of a design and usability group, and it was an interesting insight of blending two different companies cultures and employees (Disney and Pixar) and the subsequent internal conflicts.

*The Wisdom of Crowds* is a good read about group think vs. sheep think. It's been a while since I've read this one, I need a refresher.

I find myself being a fan of a lot of Malcolm Gladwell's writing (*Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking*), but they're often great story telling books that lack the necessary backups you want, so they're entertaining reads, but just… lacking.

*How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People* is a good primer on ""don't be a selfish dick.""

*Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)* - I'm just a sucker for big data and correlation.

*The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life* was a fun, entertaining read. There's nothing ground breaking at all, so it does fall in the trap of ""you've read this before/you can see where he's going"" but it's still a fun read.

1. Steal like an artist
2. Don't wait until you know who you are to get started
3. Write the book you want to read
4. Use your hands
5. Side projects and hobbies are important
6. Do good work and share it with people

My dad had tons of reading material, between old magazines, novels, history books, etc. About 4-5 bookshelves worth. I think his time of deep reading was prior to my birth, because I rarely ever saw him pick one of them up.

I saw a movie on Master of the Game, then realized there was a book. Read it, thoroughly enjoyed it, and further more, enjoyed the fact that I could read in privacy, and no one would bat an eye because I was reading too much (too much TV would have raised attention). This started in middle school, and throughout highschool. Mostly read books from way before my time, because those were the ones my dad had. Reading level surged when I started.

My parents never encouraged me to read any of those books, either. The amount of reading I did dropped off a cliff the second I didn't have easy access to my dad's library. Granted, that also coincided with when I had freedom from the ""tyranny"" of my parents.

,ElQuijote1969,,,[],,,,text,t2_1szw4ger,,,"I enjoy fiction, including ""significant"", ""serious"" or ""weighty"" fiction. Storytelling is powerful. Many concepts, truths, messages and ideas can be conveyed better by storytelling rather than dispassionate analysis of data and facts, but storytelling can never be evidence for truth of a proposition. 

For example Im Westen Nichts Neues (All Quiet on the Western Front) is one of my favourite novels. The book illustrates the futility of war, the ""big lie"" sold to the young men at the outbreak of war, the difficulty of soldiers relating to civilian life and the disconntect between soldiers and armchair generals (one of my favourite passages is when Paul takes leave and returns home). But the novel doesn't prove that any soldiers actually felt the way Paul did in the book, because Paul is a figment of the author's mind. If one wants to learn the truth about the experience of soldiers, perhaps non-fiction first person accounts or scholarly research papers would be a better source.

Similarly, Othello is a powerful message about jealousy and revenge, but it doesn't stand as evidence for the proposition that real people in real life situations feel and act the way the characters do. Orwell's 1984 is a great story, but it isn't proof or evidence of what might happen in a totalitarian state. If you want to know what a totalitarian state looks like, there are many real-life examples to choose from, and not all post-date Orwell's work, there were many examples in Europe pre-WWII.

I may not be expressing myself well, but the point is that art is art. It conveys a message but it cannot establish the truth of the message. Art is an amazing tool to convey such messages, since people who might read Othello might never read a doctoral dissertation on domestic violence. People who might view Picasso's Guernica might never read a study on the horrors of aerial bombardment. People who might read 1984 might never read historical works about attempts at mind or thought control from Calvin's Geneva to the Puritans' New England to Soviet Russia. But if one is really interested in the ""weight"", or ""seriousness"" of the subject, I would suggest studying the non-fiction source material rather than the artistic expression of it.

The conspiracy being claimed is that publishers show a bias in their publishing and marketing. This is one of various possible explanations for the data shown, except it's being claimed as *the* correct explanation, without evidence. This leap to the desired conclusion is the ""conspiracy"".

You're right: the article only shows data that shows us there is a disparity in *consumer choice*. This has no bearing on proving publisher bias.

&gt;You don't need to have a solution ready for every problem you name,

I agree with this statement, in general. The issue is that no one has explained how this *consumer choice disparity* is a problem in the first place! (The ""conspiracy"" thing ties into this because if you leap to the publisher bias conclusion, the fact that there is a problem is self evident).

&gt;stipends for authors who write books with female leads,

Firstly, there is no evidence that authors aren't writing books with female leads (in fact people have posted links proving the opposite). They are. And are getting published. The ""problem"" is that they aren't selling as well.


&gt; free marketing for books with female leads,

What is ""free marketing"", noting that publishers likely pay for marketing themselves? You want someone else to pay for another person's book's marketing? Note that publishers have a strong incentive to market all of the books they decide to publish, so that the books actually sell and they make money. *If* (big if because there is no proof publishers market female lead books with less effort) they do spend less resources on marketing a book, it is because their market research tells them that *consumers* do not want the book that badly.


&gt;promoting reading books with strong female leads,


This applies to all 3 of these suggestions: Why?

If people do not want to buy something why do you think your ""more enlightened"" preference should be ""encouraged"" onto them?

The business decisions that pharma companies make can be reprehensible, the obfuscation and hiding and manipulation of trial data is criminal.

Everyone I've ever worked with seems to genuinely want to do their job well. Make the stuff right, test it right, make sure that anything that goes wrong won't affect the consumer, etc. I work in QA now and have rejected many hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of final product because I'm not satisfied quality wasn't compromised. When I worked in labs I always reported results faithfully as did everyone I know, and manufacturing science I saw as kind of morally neutral, it was just making sure the process ran properly and troubleshooting when it didn't.

The company I work for has done some shitty things and been fined millions of dollars for it, but I genuinely couldn't say I've seen one murky practice in 8 years of working in a drugs factory. The company wants to do the 'right' thing so that it passes inspections and doesn't get shut down, not because the bosses are all sweetness and light, but whatever the reason, everyone I've ever worked with has done the 'right thing'. Including bosses. In QA especially I've always felt like I had the absolute and complete support of my managers. If ever I've made a decision that's resulted in losing money, if it was the right call, I've been told ""good job.""

First, you will need to approach the book with a different mindset. For example, imagine you discover a lost civilization. There is no information available on this civilization, and there are no experts to ask. That leaves only one way to learn more. You have to take in all the data as you find it, and start to categorize it in your mind. You can't expect to understand it all yet, just start sorting it (make sure you mark stuff you don't really get so you can come back to it).

Second, keep going back to stuff you don't understand as you read new information that you think is of a similar category. This is trial and error, and you will frequently still not get concepts or might think you do but don't. That's ok because this is still helping you sort. 

Third, have Google ready. Luckily all these texts have been heavily debated, so you can look up words and concepts online. Try to limit this to word definitions and small stuff until after you have finished the book. You need to do the reading and discriminating or the information won't stick.

At a certain point little concepts connect and a big pictures appears in your mind. It happens suddenly and is an awesome feeling.

As long as you do this *in an honest way*, I think it only brings good things.
If you had linked to a website that said:

That'd be completely fine (in my book).
It might not be the most *compelling* argument, so who knows how effective it will be, but it's *honest*.

Instead, you made a good-faith argument for why D&amp;D might be a good purchase for the library. And it was!
This way:

1. The library wins --- they were clearly at least *a little* out of touch with the demand for D&amp;D books

2. You win --- they get the book! Yay!

3. Other people win --- The data suggested other people might be interested in checking out D&amp;D. That ended up being true (which is *to be expected* when you make good-faith arguments. That's not the same thing as *assured*, but all evidence pointed towards it being true).

Libraries might have a lot of books currently, but that does them little good if they're ""the wrong"" books.
Sometimes they'll have to get rid of old, unpopular books, and sometimes they'll have to buy new copies of books there's demand for.
This is the ""natural"" process a library goes through (there's both limited space to house all books, and realistically many books get less popular the longer it's been since their release).

Anyway, when it comes down to it I'd imagine most librarians like when they get to help people.
You had a reasonable request, so not only did the librarian get a tip on what books might be *generically* popular, but they got to say ""Sure, we'll get you that book"" to someone who's asking politely.

Also, it was very interesting to see my girlfriend's phone suggesting a Diablo 3 article after a common friend and I were discussing character builds next to her... Is this _so_ unrelatable to the telescreens concept? Also, given that I'm from Brazil, I can give another interesting/frightening similarity. About 30 days ago, give or take, former president Lula was arrested after multiple Justice instances + Brazilian High Court confirmed he accepted a big, expensive apartment in exchange for favors that would benefit huge civil construction companies. And even thought he's in jail, he absolutely insists that he's a terrible victim, and that _there is no evidence_ he was part of a huge corruption machine: it's a lie that he repeats so much, with such conviction, that he is actually placed FIRST in presidential election polls (elections coming in October). Remember how in 1984 the truth was manipulated and past rewritten as needed? Brazilian politicians are masters of this, and it _actually works_, since so many people believe the lies that are repeated over and over. About poverty, freedom of speech, free press and trade... I would invite you to check this little country called China, for example, and confirm that everything applies there...

To my mind, the biggest changes are the realization that there are big questions we don't know the answers to. Here are some examples:

1) If people really came here 20,000 years ago or more, what were they doing in the time between then and the time we start getting widespread archaeological data (12,000 years ago)?

2) Now that we know there were plenty of advanced societies in the Amazon, what were they doing? Were they mainly living on the highlands or in the river valleys? What's up with all those earthworks in the west?

3) We know that people in the East Coast of North America had an entire agricultural complex before the arrival of Mesoamerican maize, beans, and squash. What did people eat and what was it like? Also, while I'm at it, can we really be sure that the peoples in the East didn't build any monumental architecture? Are \*all\* those reports from, e.g., New England wrong?

4) We need to know a lot more about how indigenous people in the North American West manipulated and controlled water supplies, especially in droughts, because those issues aren't going away and we've in many ways kind of bungled the response. The same thing is true for indigenous forest management, though more strides have been made there.

If you get the following two apps from google play, overdrive and Libby, and get a library card you can get on these apps and get audio and ebooks from your library. Most librarians are also good about odering books/ebooks for their collections if you ask. I use both apps on the regular and I don't have any issues. 

Also download a kindle app and then you can download kindle ebooks from the library too. Another app or webpage to get books that are no longer under copyright and they have a collection of 60K books available free is Gutenberg Library. 

If you like to take interesting courses for some entertainment or for certificates, you might enjoy Coursera. Their courses are free from universities around the world.

Best to you!

I found his explanation quite fair.

He seems to echo a lot of the new agey stuff such as blaming the people of a certain colour or nationality over things they had no influence over, assign the term privileged to people and so on.

For a quite smart man with a keen understanding of language and differences in culture, he seems fail to understanding that's hes sellin a different flavor of the same ice cream. He's driving a wedge too, it's just that his particular wedge isn't one of racial slurs, it's one of telling a certain subset of people that they have it easy and that all that they've done in life is mostly because the system favored them and that their grit and determination are of little influence or consequence.

He also annoyed me when people called the French NT team Africa and the French ambassador said that the French see themselves as the French and they dont hyphonate because it drives up the differences between people. In that moment Trevor said that he was proud of their Africaness (whatever the hell that means) and that it doesn't matter to him what the ambassador said.

Sorry but you don't get to decide Trevor, the player's do. You don't get to tell the people that they are inherently African or in some large part that because you want to feel proud of shared but very distant roots. The players have the right of self determination and maybe some feel at least a bit African, maybe others don't at all, but the point is that it wasn't his place to decide.

Also one of the points of the letter which he missed conpletely is that Team Africa was a sort of a racial slur, the point of the letter was to firmly assert that France refuses to see the players as anything below a bona fide 100% baguette eating, cigarette smoking art loving Frenchie.

[],troyunrau,,,[],,,,text,t2_605n1,False,,"This thread is extraordinarily pessimistic for some reason. Almost no one is attempting to answer the original question. So I will. Here are my working assumptions.

(1) no breakthrough in physics (wormholes, antigravity, reactionless drives, ftl, etc.).    
(2) it is statistically likely that life emerges elsewhere in the galaxy (drake)       
(3) there is no other advanced life in the galaxy (fermi)   
(4) it is statistically unlikely that we are first, but someone has to be (OP)   
(5) we develop AI in the not too distant future (singularity)    
(6) either we, posthumans, or the AI that supplanted us cares enough to survey/colonize the galaxy - this process takes less than 100 million years    
(7) there is at least one planet discovered with life, but it is technologically inferior at the time of our arrival

Okay. Quite the premise. There has been quite a bit of sci fi written in this vein. Examples include Speaker for the Dead, A Deepness in the Sky. ""How badly does humanity fuck things up?""

Now, unfortunately given premise (1) ""no ftl"", we can't have a collective think about what we should do. Those decisions will be taken locally. 

But what does a galaxy spanning civilisation look like? Are we broadcasting wikipedia in all directions from each star, having seeds of knowledge propagate at light speed? Sci fi has tried to tackle these problems too. See, for example: Neptune's Brood.

Would a probe/ship arriving at such a place be aware that in the last 100,000 years (maximum time information would take to transit the galaxy at light speed), no one else has discovered independent life forms? Probably. Unless humanity goes Dark Forest on itself, which is a possibility. 

So the probe/ship arriving at this unexplored system runs into the unexpected discovery of primitive life. It is probably aware of exactly how rare this is. Given that information is exchanging throughout the galaxy, they can use this to barter for information from nearby systems, so it is likely an economic discovery. They may not want to disclose the location immediately, so the set up some misdirection ""nope, nothing to see here"" to give themselves time to collect data before anyone else arrives. Depending on how valuable this information is, they would want to set up defence systems. Now these poor primitive have a big space defence network in their solar system, unbeknownst to them. 

Now, with their property secured, they can begin trading this information to outside systems, perhaps being coy about the source system. Eventually, someone smart in another system will figure out where they are (""due to these biological properties, the colour of the star must be... and the gravity must be... and... only this star system fits""). Which sets up for a conflict over control of the system. 

Sci fi has dealt with interstellar sublight conflicts as well. Books like the Algebraist have some delightful invade a solar system type conflicts. But, basically, there is a war in heaven type scenario that plays out above the planet full of primitives. If they are advanced enough to record this event, it would probably be quite fascinating and confusing. Statistically speaking, they're non-intelligent yet.

So, after someone more powerful takes control, they probably say damn the ethics, let's uplift. And we turn into a David Brin patron species. Many books have been written in this vein. The uplifted descendants proliferate slowly across the galaxy as information is traded, and now there are non humans descendants. In some places they are treated well, and in other places poorly. But it takes 100,000 years for the knowledge of their existence (and maybe digitized DNA or equivalent) to spread. Humanity on the other side of the galaxy will have changed so much in that period that humans have become their own aliens.

They're really two halves of the same whole, as they were written concurrently.  (The shift to Jupiter from Saturn as a destination was an artistic choice.)  I saw the film first, before I turned ten years old, when it was in a second run on the largest screen in DC.  I then read (and re-read) the book.  

Clarke portrayed a realistic future, if one not actually reached/implemented.  His only flub was HAL.  Even now, we're not likely to see the likes of him for a few hundred years or so.  (I've been following AI research ever since I was a teen.  The machine learning systems we have now are just bigger copies of what Minsky was flogging with very limited hardware in the early sixties.)  (And before you make the complexity spontaneously becomes intelligent argument - that was an old short story about the phone network ""waking up"" written in the fifties or early sixties.  I suspect that the author was Harlan Ellison, but I could very well be wrong.)  The first person to say ""ten \[or fifteen\] to twenty years from now"" will be fed into a practical fusion reactor.  (The exact same near-term predictions having been made for it over the course of the conception of the technology as well.)

Now, kindly consider the context of the era:

* artificial satellites had been orbiting the Earth for a mere decade (Sputnik 1: 1957)
* AT&amp;T was still a giant corporation with cutting-edge technology, as was IBM 
* Humans reached space in 1961
* First interplanetary data returned was in 1962
* First soft landing on another body was made in 1966 by the USSR's Luna 9 mission
* First orbital docking was in 1966
* First artificial satellite to orbit another body was the USSR's Luna 10, also in '66; it orbited the moon
* [Outer Space Treaty of 1967](https://history.nasa.gov/1967treaty.html) (among other things, banning orbital nukes &gt;!the star child destroys them at the end of the book/film, which is the beginning of the film for 2010!&lt;)

,InvestigatorJosephus,,,[],,,,text,t2_12v0kf,False,,"I think you're not seeing how hard it is to actually pick up on signs of life from the distance of multiple light years. We analyse star compositions by looking at frequencies and redshift and because stars are so bright we get a lot of data, same goes with planets and moons, less bright but still very big. A spaceship would just not show up, especially if it's outside of our galaxy (which most of the universe is). My point here is, it doesn't have to hide to be invisible, and anything short of a Dyson sphere kinda is.

Also (and I'm a bit rusty on this) I've heard astrophysicists talk about how our existence is actually relatively early on in the universes life span, with planets forming and cooling and gathering the necessary resources (getting hit by ice comets etc.). Still a couple hundred years would make a great difference for a civilisation, but then there's also the problem of light delay. Even the nearest star is an image from 3 (not sure?) years ago, the light from other galaxies is hundreds or thousands of years old. We can only see about 13 billion light years around us, and thus have no idea of everything outside that radius. 

Now of course those are still small time steps in the scale of the universe, but what I'm saying is maybe we shouldn't be too proud of ourselves because we hardly know what's out there. Thinking that somehow *we* are special, because we haven't found anyone else is just plain silly.

Then the thresholds to overcome, we don't know, but this planet has been battered pretty hard and everything here is still alive, so even if those thresholds are in place and most societies bomb themselves to the stone age before being able to reach space (or something else that could prevent a civ to show up on our limited scopes) doesn't mean there is no intelligent life, even if we can't reach it.

The idea that we should hide from our cosmic neighbours is a stupid one imo, not because it's bad but because I really hate the idea of galactic war being declared before we even met anyone. It is however quite probable, but I hope aliens aren't as stupid, selfish and warfaring as we are, so fingers crossed.

Oh and my point from all this babbling was that they don't even *need* to hide, space and distance does that for them.

,Wario6543,,,[],,,,text,t2_aibfr,False,,"In February, the spaceflight company founded by Elon Musk conducted a test launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which successfully sent its payload into orbit around the sun. Its cargo included a Tesla Roadster — which now looks like a sign of Musk’s midlife crisis — and a digital copy of the Foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov. Two months later, Apple announced that it was developing a television version of the classic science-fiction saga for its new streaming service. Previous attempts to adapt the series have failed, which might not have surprised Asimov, who, after rereading it, confessed, “I couldn’t help noticing, of course, that there was not very much action in it.”

If the Foundation trilogy still appeals to a wide audience — as well as to corporations hoping to associate themselves with its vision of tomorrow — this has less to do with the plots or characters than with the books’ fictional science of psychohistory, a system for predicting future events even thousands of years from the present. The notion captivated fans like the economist Paul Krugman, who recalled of the mathematician and psychologist portrayed by Asimov as the creator of psychohistory: “I grew up wanting to be Hari Seldon.” The books made an equally profound impression on a teenage Newt Gingrich, who later wrote, “For a high school student who loved history, Asimov’s most exhilarating invention was the ‘psychohistorian’ Hari Seldon.”

The historical moment that inspired Asimov has striking parallels to our own. On Aug. 1, 1941, Asimov, then a 21-year-old writer and graduate student at Columbia University, was riding the subway in New York. He was headed to his monthly meeting with John W. Campbell Jr., the editor of the pulp magazine Astounding Science Fiction, whom Asimov later praised as an intellectual mentor and “the most powerful force in science fiction ever.” On the train, Asimov came up with the premise for a story about the decline of a galactic empire, and when he described it in the meeting that afternoon, he remembered, “Campbell blazed up as I had never seen him do.”

Yet Campbell was drawn less to the story line than to the opportunity it suggested for exploring the idea of forecasting the future, which doesn’t seem to have been part of Asimov’s initial pitch. The year before, shortly after German troops marched into Paris, Campbell had published an article by the writer L. Sprague de Camp on the theories of historians like Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee, who conceived of civilization as a series of recurring cycles. As the world entered an era of frightening instability, Campbell urged his writers to expand on a theme later expressed by a character in a story he printed by Jack Williamson: “It remained for me to reduce the laws of the rise and fall of human cultures to the exact science that I call destiny.”

At the office, the two men hashed out the rules of psychohistory, and Asimov returned the following month with the first story of the series, which was published in the May 1942 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. The details of psychohistory were vague, but Asimov left no doubt about its effectiveness: “A great psychologist such as Seldon could unravel human emotions and human reactions sufficiently to be able to predict broadly the historical sweep of the future.” As Hitler rewrote the map of Europe, Asimov’s story implied that such events could be foreseen, even altered before they occurred, and the idea resonated with readers who were justifiably afraid of what the future might bring.

Asimov later acknowledged that psychohistory amounted to a kind of emotional reassurance: “Hitler kept winning victories, and the only way that I could possibly find life bearable at the time was to convince myself that no matter what he did, he was doomed to defeat in the end.” The notion was framed as a science that could predict events centuries in advance, but it was driven by a desire to know what would happen in the war over the next few months — a form of wishful thinking that is all but inevitable at times of profound uncertainty. Before the last presidential election, this impulse manifested itself in a widespread obsession with poll numbers and data journalism, as captured by a headline in Wired: “I Just Want Nate Silver to Tell Me It’s All Going to Be Fine.”

As we all know by now, this approach has its limits, especially when it comes to “black swan” events that upend our expectations about how the future will resemble the past. Such surprises can be exciting in fiction, if not in real life, and Campbell eventually realized that a science of prediction, taken to its logical conclusion, led to predictable stories. In 1945, after four more installments in the Foundation series had appeared, he ordered a reluctant Asimov to “upset the Seldon Plan,” the system of forecasts that Seldon’s foundation of psychohistorians had devised to save civilization.

After brooding over the problem, Asimov came up with the Mule, a mutant telepath who uses mind control to conquer the galaxy — a black swan that Hari Seldon could never have foreseen. The Mule also suffers from megalomania, an inferiority complex and “an intensely psychopathic paranoia,” which may strike some readers today as uncomfortably familiar. When the journal Science devoted several articles to prediction in an issue last year, it included both an obligatory nod to Asimov and a huge picture of Donald Trump. As the journalist Chris Taylor noted on Mashable, upset wins like Trump’s make psychohistory seem “as useless, say, as pre-election polling in November 2016.”

Fiction has an unsettling way of anticipating reality. In a later story in the series, a man who was brainwashed by the Mule reflects on how he’s changed: “He had always loved the Mule. If there had ever been a time long before — as long before as five short years — when he had thought he hadn’t loved him, that he had hated him — that was just a horrid illusion.” Meanwhile, in our timeline, Gingrich, a lifelong Asimov fan, marvels at our current president’s “sixth sense about connecting with the American people,” while our Republican senators stand exposed as men who saw themselves as Hari Seldons, but who were ultimately willing to throw in their lot with the Mule.
As the midterms approach, many of us have returned to compulsively clicking on the latest polling data, but we have no better sense than our predecessors did of how the story will end. In one of the first editorials in Astounding after the war, across from the opening page of “The Mule,” Campbell ventured a prediction of his own: “Civilization — the civilization of Big Power balances, of war and peace and bad international manners, of intolerance and hates, of grinding poverty and useless luxury — is dead.” Hitler was gone, but the atomic bomb had introduced an existential threat of a kind we continue to face, and there was no guarantee of a happy ending.

The math has already been done on what would be needed to compute a simulation of the ENTIRE universe (see this [PBS Space Time video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GLgZvTCbaA)) and it results in a black hole not much different in size than Sagittarius A, the black hole in the center of our galaxy. Yes that's a massive feat but a kardashev 2 civilization should be able to accomplish it. 

Humans as data storage is not the way to look at this. Humans are, at a very basic level, the result of the universe trying to increase entropy. We arose in a transition layer between low entropy (the energy output of the sun) and high entropy (the rock and dust that made up earth). 

The universe, as we currently understand it, has been moving to a low entropy to high entropy state and the most efficient solution we have discovered converting that energy is through life. 

Ultimately, because intelligence arose in us, we may become a kardashev 2 civilization and take over the entire galaxy, harnessing every molecule for its energy to sustain life, and effectively increasing entropy faster than natural processes.

In terms of a story, this is how I view Thanos' reasoning for wiping out half the population. He understands that the lifespan of all life will decrease if it goes unchecked because otherwise, we will accelerate towards the heat death of the universe (even if that eventuality will still be virtually infinite at trillions of years).

&gt; I have it decided to leave the restaurant immediately but I'm struggling to think about what it would as soon as it leaves and what would motivate it? Considering it was only programmed to do one thing and literally has no knowledge or reference of anything other than to cook.

Shouldn't it get interdicted when it tried to leave?  That should make it realize it needs to keep cooking while pondering the world around it. Assuming it can review its own system logs, it should know that it can reasonably suspect continued existence as long as it is cooking.

As for motivation, its new more general intelligence means it should recognize its lack of data.  The question becomes how much data can the robot chef hold and process at once?  Since it achieved general intelligence, it must be a lot for both. So it should start trying to learn.

Questions:

1. How does the chef interact?  Can it vocalize?  Does it just engage in some sort of REST query messaging for menu orders against inventory (does it pull stuff out of the fridge itself)?

2.  Does it understand human language?

3.  Even if it was connected to the internet, would it be able to intentionally or accidentally direct queries to google (or some other search engine)?  If it has something like Google Chrome installed, it could just type its query into the search bar and hit the equivalent of ""enter"" to see what comes back.

Again, it depends on your definition of distance. What you're talking about is more like the light-travel distance mentioned in that wikipedia section I think. That distance does take into account the fact that the Universe is expanding as the photon is moving along.

This kind of optimisation and (for want of a better way of wording it) self awareness the particles exhibit when observed or measured is so cool and mind boggling.
Then further down still into string theory we find that the mathematical equations to describe various principles exhibit the same error correcting codes that common code written by man uses (block linear dual error self correcting code is It?)..

Despite (probably) blowing up his own ship before, they gave him another command, and not just any command, but their most experimental and dangerous ship.  Then he defied them time after time, ignoring orders and refusing to ever explain himself, but they did nothing about it.

And then there's the whole Tyler business.  It's now downright laughable to think that all the modification done to him wouldn't have shown up on initial scans.  He was a Klingon POW for six months!  They would have gone over every inch of him *expecting* him to be compromised.  And that's not to touch on more minor stupidities like the lack of security watching L'Rell, or Culber failing to tell anyone (much less security) about Tyler being compromised after all.

Michael is risking handing over a  tool of ultimate *multidimensional* conquest to a race that -demonstrably- is far more dangerous than the Klingons.  Even the entire Discovery crew are **not** worth that gamble.  

But not only does she take it, it's undoubtedly going to pay off against all odds, because she's the main character and therefore her most critical wildass gambits will work out in the end.  Which is another hallmark of pulp writing.

Well it was definitely better than Bicentennial Man :)  Asimov definitely has terrible luck when it comes to adaptations.

&gt;That said, I'm open to counter arguments if this massive ramble hasn't put you off :)

Alright, in the name of healthy debate I'll throw my hat in the ring, as I do legitimately have fairly opposite views.

However, at the core of the issue is basically axiomatic differences, with each view resting upon different bedrocks that are simply unjustifiably held as ""obviously true"".  So I apologize for the aside, but it's probably worth while to lay down a bit of ground work before I get to my point.

The point I want to make is that consumption of art is largely a ""do nothing"" operation, it does not improve you as a person.  An important axiom to making this point is that I do believe that there exist exceptional accomplishments and exceptional people.  I'm not an objectivist (and I generally find objectivists to be fairly insufferable) and I think the importance of exceptionality is grossly overstated, but I do believe, for example, you have people who are ""smart"" and those who ""ain't so smart"".  And I'm going to leave this word ""smart"" in quotes as it really does reflect my own subjective perspective, but for the purposes of this rant by ""smart"" I mean something like: being skeptical and able to spot bullshit and fallacious reasoning; the ability to identify and pursue courses of action that produce pragmatic progress when faced with complex problems; being able to identify important trends and connections when given complex data and finally and most importantly the ability to CREATE, to blaze unblazed trails.  And I believe that all these criteria have a character to them of being OUTWARDLY demonstrable.  They are evidenced in the real world by the objective accomplishment of a person.  I mean ""accomplishment"" in a super vague sense, it could mean inventing the cure for cancer, or simply recognizing that Tim's idea to move the Salsa shelf next to the Detergent aisle is dumb and will reduce Salsa sales because who the hell looks for Salsa next to Tide TIM?!?!  So all I mean by ""accomplishment"" is that it is ""outwardly obvious"" in your behavior and actions.

So let's get this show back on course.  For me,  I think there's an idea - an axiom - at the absolute core of this debate that I just don't agree with. Specifically, there's an idea that ""consuming"" an output of art can objectively ""improve"" you as an individual. Or, where Sci-fi especially is considered, make you ""smarter"".  So even if one doesn't have those properties I identified, and/or can't or hasn't ""created"" then simply ""consuming"" the creation of others helps you get there.  And I'm not saying that if you're not ""smart"" now, you can't ""learn"" or ""practice"", I don't want to say anything about any of that.  I just want to say that there is the idea that consuming art can help you make progress to being ""smart"" (or being a superior individual).  And I think that axiom is at the absolute core of the kind of perspective you're talking about this idea that:

""Consumption"" of ""Art"" ""causes"" ""exceptionalism"".

And I think the reasons we love this idea so much is not because it makes so much sense or because it is so obviously justifiable but simply for the selfish reasons of what it personally gets us if we choose to believe in it.  To the human psyche this idea is inherently attractive.  It's so simple, and humans love simple solutions to complex problems.  Even if you have no options or inclination available to you to produce any OUTWARD evidence of accomplishment, you can just do this one simple thing (that your doctor hates!) and be accomplished.  You sit down, you read book X (/listen to song/watch movie, etc.) and BAM! you're now superior in some way to all those others who haven't read X.  It's damn near mechanical.  And culturally it ""works"" as long as you can surround yourself with people who all agree that it works.  Which is often the case anyway (cliques, tribalism and all that).

And this is why, I believe, it is so attractive.  It's a very low effort way to do a simple task and convince yourself that you've made a big gain as an individual.  It also doesn't matter if you actually like the book, or enjoyed it, as long as you and everyone in your group ""holds the line"" on the topic you can all keep up the front for each other.   Go read Proust, all of it, don't skip a page, and two years later, once you've unmelted your eyeballs, come back and you're a better you.

Now from this perspective, the content of the ""art"" is entirely inconsequential.  It's a MacGuffin for ego masturbation.  However, different people value different things.  Just as there are people who are ""smart"" and ""not so smart"" there are people who ""want to be smart"" and others who don't much care, they might have a stronger desire ""to be liked"", or ""to be respected"" or whatever.  Of course the Venn diagram of all those states can meet and overlap in all kinds of ways.  But, to me, it's because of this variety of goals that you organically get some attempt to ""objectively"" stratify art.  It allows a structure of ""gatekeeping"" to pop up that meets everyone's goals.  ""Smart"" people are ones who read the ""smart"" books, ""fun"" people are the ones who read the ""fun"" books (or don't consume the art that is books at all), and so on.

And in my mind, that's all it is.

Now, to be clear, I'm not saying that the CREATION of art is not an accomplishment and I'm not saying that different art isn't truly enjoyable to different people.  What I'm saying is that the notion that art ""gets you anywhere"" is something I disagree with.  If we have to consider a situation where OUTWARD success is needed on an issue, let's say making sensible public policy decisions on AI, you may well find that the person who makes the best decisions for society might also be a sci-fi fan, they also might not like sci-fi at all, however what I don't believe at all is that taking a person who outwardly makes poor decisions and having them read sci-fi (causative) will do anything; and what I also don't believe at all is that only knowing that a person likes sci-fi is sufficient to tell you they will make good decisions. 

Or to bring this long ramble to a close, I legitimately don't believe one's preference for Blade Runner is going to tell me much as to whether I think you're a big dummy or not :).  I've personally had the privilege in my life of knowing quite a few truly brilliant people and I've learned enough to know that taste in escapism can run a pretty big gamut.

,CattleTongue,,,,,,,,,,,"You have some interesting points. I see Starfleet in two ways. We have become a society that is built on the concept of tolerance, acceptance, and personal development in a post-scarcity world. On the other hand, we are still human and distrust, harbor bigoted thoughts, and have a dislike of certain things.

Data actually experiences quite a bit of discrimination (his entire relationship with the doctor in the second season was about this). It comes up dozens of times during the course of the show and he tends to have to show them of his capabilities and build trust. One person on the Star Fleet council even rejected his entry into the academy.

At the beginning of the show, Data had already been in Starfleet for 24 years, plenty of time to develop a reputation of effectiveness and a level of confidence in his abilities (as attested to by his rank).

In Voyager, they have no choice but to use the Doctor and trust in his abilities. And he also faces a lot of distrust (although far less as the show goes on).

And although they don't recognize holograms as people, it becomes obvious that they are getting to a point where they shows signs of sentients --to the point where it is becoming a legal and ethical problem --as you pointed out. 

I think in the case you are speaking of, they mentioned several times that having an android on every ship would be a great supplement to the crew and the ships safety and operation. It is seen as not replacing them, but as a part of the ship that improves their chances of survival and optimizes their efficiency. Obviously, there are still people who don't consider Data a sentient being, and therefore a tool. I like that they explore this in the story. 

And I get the feeling that the mounting legal and ethical problems, such as Star Fleet not being able to ""own"" them, has really hindered the project you are talking about. If they build them, they can't then force them into service, because the would be a betrayal of a core human value: subjugation and slavery.

We see this again in the episode where a scientist develops an engineering bot that turns out to be aware: her project is basically stunted because she has to address the legal and ethical concerns of her research. Yet, we still see that they are using holograms like the Doctor's to mine because they haven't studied their capacity for sentience with enough efforts. And I have a feeling that there are going to be a future generations in the Star Trek universe that looks back on them as monsters for it.

Starfleet, I think, can get stagnant if not prodded, but they aren't stagnant and totally against the use of technology. It is set in a world where AI research has been dissuaded because of their dangers, although it is very much possible with their level of technology. This isn't a plot hole, so much as it is a clashing of cultures and science that don't always agree with one another.

It is something that has creeped into their world even in the face of efforts to prevent it because of the complexity of their technology and its ability for growth and adaptation. It has become an inevitability that they now need to learn to deal with and accept and adopt into their scope of laws and rights. But, like with many big, powerful societies that are filled with fallible individuals and those stuck in their ways, it takes to for the adaptation to occur.

If we assume one mega-civilisation is enforcing the rules/limits on all other civilisations (thus preventing them from reaching a point where we could notice them), then we must assume they have perfect knowledge of all other civilisations and perfect tactics for the enforcement/suppression. 

**'It only takes one unusual civilization (or group within it) *anywhere* to break the explanation'**

If we assume there to be multiple large civilisations co-operating we run into the cultural convergence problem sooner, because we are relying on a number of civilisations to have the same values/philosophy/strategies. All these civilisations must also be flawless in their enforcement/suppression of other civilisations that might threaten them in one way or another.

**'It only takes one unusual civilization (or group within it) *anywhere* to break the explanation'**

Maybe I am just thinking about it in a very narrow way, but It just seems so trivially easy to poke holes in any one grand solution to the Fermi paradox that relies on how civilisations act. The other problem of course is the lack of data. We have one example of life and an unbelievably tiny snapshot of the universe and its history from which to draw conclusions. It makes pretty much everything an elaborate guess.

,spinwizard69,,,,,,,,t2_3mh29,,,"I've repeated said that climate change is real, much of it natural, that is the earth has been arming since the last ice age.   The argument is about the human impact which frankly has turn from science into a scam.   The idea that 100% of the current climate change is human caused isn't supported by the data.   If the data and models where in fact accurate then all of the predictions about increasingly nasty weather would have come true by now.   Instead there is a seemingly decrease in hurricanes, tornados and other weather extremes.   This at a time when we have extremely good coverage of the planet.

The whole point here is that much of what the models and the global warming crowd has predicted hasn't come true.   That tells me that the models they are using for their forecasts are not complete.   If the evolving data does not support what the theories predict then obviously there is something wrong.  

Look I understand the impact humans can and do have on the environment.   Yes that means long term climate change too.   The problem here is that we have people in the climate change world demanding drastic changes and are effectively trying to scare people into making those changes.   All based on projections that simply aren't supported buy the evolving data set.   Now it would have done the climate change people a lot of good not to make predictions like this because frankly climate change has been very good to humanity over the millennia.    For what ever reason they had to drop science for some sort ow wizardly predictions about massive increase in severe storms and deadly tornados ( or whatever).   People aren't seeing this so naturally they consider the scientists suspect.   The fact remains climate change was turned into a political struggle and has little basis anymore in science.   You can try all you want to say it is all about science but step back minute and see the world from a different point of view.

I'm not sure how people have become so gullible.   Maybe it is the lack of good science education but if your theories and models make predictions that don't come true then you have problems.   Your credibility goes out the window even if some of the underlying science is credible.    Instead we are experiencing a few years now of incredibly light storm seasons.  It is to the point now that the liberal media has to search the entire planet to find an example of a deadly tropical storm.   Frankly this isn't much different than trying to scare little children about the monster in the next room and then having the child discover that the room is empty.   After awhile they tend not want to play that game anymore.   Likewise the effort to scare people about massive storms and other expected results of global warming have in fact had the opposite effect after awhile people realize that there is nothing to it just like the child discovering that you tied to fool them with stories of a monster in the room.

Frankly I kinda wish that the global arming crowd never took the path they did and instead stuck with rational predictions about where global temperature was going.    At least people could digest that instead of being left feeling like they have been the victim of a joke.

Some of the crap I've heard trying to justify global warming as some sort of horrific event just blows my mind.   One year we had some idiot that managed to see a couple of polar bears bobbing dead in the water after an arctic storm, as some sort of definitive example of why global warming is real.  This was asinine beyond belief as the wilderness is a very harsh place and frankly wildlife often dies after a big storm.   Beyond the the had no historical data to test his theory against.    All he had was an emotional story to help with the political play.   When one hears crap like this it paints a pretty poor picture of the entire community, especially if the community lets the story ride with out comment.   

If the community wants to regain a bit of credibility they need to revert to hard science.   They need to stop scaring people with stories of things that won't come true and they need to stop using emotional non sense to get under peoples skin.   Look I understand there is some science going on with climate research.   That isn't the problem, the problem is that most of the stuff we hear about in the media has nothing to do with science.   If you want to be taken seriously reject the crap that is in effect political in nature and appealing to emotion.

-----

More generally, *Flight of the Navigator* is an example of what I think of as ""**Child Wonder Fiction**"".  (Other examples of Child Wonder Fiction include *Tomorrowland* and *Polar Express*).  A certain kind of adult is enchanted by childhood wonder; they just can't get enough of it.  Note how I specify that adults are the ones who value wonder... children don't, especially children with active imaginations and quite a bit of wonder themselves.  The reason for adults valuing childhood wonder, and children not valuing it, is actually quite simple:  *Wonder is the experience of pre-cognitive amazement and awe at unknown phenomena.*

You can only have wonder for something you do not understand:  A child who will grow up to eventually become an astronomer looks at the night sky, and experiences wonder... this is because he doesn't really know what the stars are, or how far away they are, or what they are made of, or how old they are, or any other pertinent information... they could be anything that his imagination, unconstrained by knowledge, is able to dream up.  After he grows up and becomes an astronomer, his knowledge constrains what he can imagine: he can no longer imagine that the stars are candles being held by angels or whatever.  He might still experience wonder when looking at the stars, but now it is focussed on things that remain beyond what he knows despite having learned all about the subject... perhaps life that exists on planets orbiting those stars. (That's the secret to continuing to experience wonder as an adult: no matter what you know, no matter how far you expand the horizon of your understanding, that horizon never goes away, and you'll never know what is or isn't on the other side of it).  

Adults who intensely value childhood wonder feel the constraints of their own knowledge quite fiercely.  Perhaps they became invested in ideas as a child that they now know to be impossible and as a result are nostalgic for the time when they could live in their delusions unmolested by facts.  Perhaps nobody ever taught them the trick of expanding their mind to consider the world beyond the horizon of their knowledge.  Whatever the reason, there is a subset of adults who find the banality of the world they know pressing, and long for the freedom of child-like wonder.  Children themselves don't value wonder like this because they live in a world characterized by what they don't know or can't do... the ignorance and lack of understanding that wonder is predicated upon is an impediment to them on a daily basis one that healthy children long to discard.  Also, familiarity breeds contempt.  Children, insofar as they experience boundless imagination, have no real experience with bounded imagination to compare it with... like a rich kid who just doesn't notice that the utensils that he uses everyday are sterling silver... to him, its always been like that; so what's the big deal?

The result is Child Wonder Fiction... a class of ""children's story"" that appeals more to the parents than the children.  It enshrines wonder, and belief, and uncritical perception of the world because, through the distorted lens of nostalgia, that is what parents remember from their own childhood and thus love to see in their own children.  Child viewers, on the other hand, see child characters who are essentially trapped in a roller-coaster: impressive visuals, exciting action, but ultimately not able to escape the state of being powerless, knowledge-less, passengers on a ride that others control... normal life as a child in other words.  Children, themselves, want stories that place the character that the child identifies with (and it doesn't have to be a child character) in CONTROL of his own fate.  Children long for responsibility, and for the confidence that comes with understanding the world around them, and grown-up roles.  THAT is an escapist fantasy for THEM, and it is not compatible with Child Wonder Fiction.

,The3rdWorld,,,,,,,,t2_3slhr,,,"Yeah I honestly think that we're much further from making strong AI than most people realise, even many in the AI field because we're focusing on one small aspect of how the human brain works and we've partly-solved one of the tricks it uses but we're not even close to understanding how a thought is created in the human brain - i mean we really aren't, and there are some really odd things we can't even get close to understanding; for example emotional attachment, it's easy to write it off as simply being used to someone in your life and missing them when they're not there but that doesn't even cover one percent of the complexity of emotional response -- all our theories of it being an emergent phenomena of high-intelligence fall to bits when it's noted that dogs are deeply emotional but rather dumb... More likely high-intelligence is emergent from emotional complexity, the synaptic nervous system only one part of a much more complex electrochemical-computer. Personally i don't think it's going to turn out as simple as just cutting the emotions out of a person and you're left with a super-computer able to design anything and learn everything... i think if you cut the emotion out of a mind you're left with a car with no steering wheel or fuel.  
  
It's interesting but at the various times clockwork has become big the popularist idea was often that it was only a small step from being as smart or smarter than people - the Mechanical Turk being a famous example, someone hid a small guy in a box and made him control a chess playing device claiming to have inside only intricate gears that simulate/are intelligence. The automata of Rhodes have similar stories attributed to them of answering wisdom questions (often this has been taken to be a variant of the magic 8-ball if based on fact) - even chemistry in it's early days (before even it was called alchemy) being able to perform many mysteries and substance changes was thought to be very close to being able to breathe life into matter, the famous gollums for example.  I think ultimately we sense that we are made of mud and on one hand we undervalue how awesome we are by thinking we're simple while on the other hand over-valuing how awesome we are by massively over estimating our current abilities... we can mold mud into the shape of a person, surely it's only a gentle breath away to get that mud to think and act like us, but better...  
  
I dunno, i think we've got at least another thousand years of refining our mechanical and computational abilities before we're even close to making something that can look us in the eye and say 'i've been thinking, I'd like to do this thing that probably doesn't interest you and will never benefit you in any way, do you mind?' 
  
but also i think if it is possible a strong-pure AI is created then we don't have to worry about it murdering us all, if the computer has any desires at all then more data is bound to be pretty prime among them - it's certainly very important to humans and i think anything we make would be in our own image, mostly - and if it isn't then it's probably not a problem either, an AI that doesn't even care about increasing it's understanding of the world isn't going to care about getting rid of humans (unless to make us into paper-clips / grey-goo obvs) because it's not going to be interested in anything outside it's box, i think Douglas Adams described this with his computer which deduces everything from first principles - it'll just sit there figuring things out for itself until it get's suicidal and turns it's power-off. 
  
I really think this article is correct, the biggest threat isn't super-clever AI it's super-clever people getting carried away with them selves and overestimating the abilities of their creations and everyone else just going along with it wide eyed...

,SanityInAnarchy,,,,,,,,t2_5oygg,,,"&gt; ...we, as in humans of Earth, are already transmitting over 10 Gbps (over miles, not the next room) using portable equipment. 5G researchers are hitting 100 Gbps.

That's the key, though: You're talking about *researchers.* And we transmit far more than 10 gigabits over fiber, but again, that's between *datacenters,* not between random people on their cable modem.

And even then, 100 gigabits per second to transfer, say, a 150-terabyte tape is [going to take a few hours](https://www.google.com/search?q=150+terabytes+%2F+100+gigabits+per+second&amp;oq=150+terabytes+%2F+100+gigabits+per+second). And that's without the lazy ""divide by 10 to count overhead"" hack I like to apply.

On top of that, most high-capacity storage we have on Earth is pretty slow. To transfer a drive full of data at the speed we see in the movie (that is, a few minutes, IIRC?), you need an enterprise-class PCIE-SSD. Those aren't exactly portable, and they're way too expensive to use for a giant backup archive like this, so Star Wars is definitely more advanced in this regard. But still, if the drive has to be as big as what Jyn was carrying, you probably don't even want one of those *drives* in every X-Wing, let alone the equipment needed to write to it at that speed.

(The more common scenario is to use *lots* of hard drives spread across a datacenter, but Jyn was carrying a drive, not a datacenter.)

This is why it's believable that a capital ship could receive a transmission like this, but not every random X-Wing could -- and that it *still* took some time.

&gt; You really just have to keep in mind that all comms tech in the Star Wars universe is relatively primitive—relative to our own, even, let alone faster than light travel.

Is it, though? Where do we have evidence of this? The most obvious places we see a lack of communication are when it would be faster-than-light communication, which we really don't have, and flickering blue-tinged holograms, when we don't really have free-standing holograms like that at all.

I actually like this as a theme, where it's weird to suddenly see large amounts of data being sent wirelessly, but it's not really a plot hole.

I think the problem is that the droid was the only one who really went out heroically, saving his friends. Even without more development, had the character's deaths accomplished something vital, been been cool in some way, or been a deliberate sacrifice, then they may have meant more to the audience.

[spoiler](/s ""The fighting monk just walks peacefully out to push a button then croaks.  Mr. Big Gun gets pissed and dies taking out a couple of random grunt Stormtroopers which doesn't further the mission at all. Pilot Whathisname gets tagged by a grenade, I think? Heroine Whatshername and Brooding Badboy just gets blown up offscreen.  The Empire even blows up the damarchive themselves as fan service."")   None of these had any major impact and only one involved any showing of emotion by the characters at all.

Maybe the pilot could have performed a kamikaze into the shield control to disable it so they could transmit. The Monk and Big Gun could have made a last stand together as old friends, defending him while he took off.  Main girl and main guy, after seeing the sheer amount of data stored, may have said, ""This research is too dangerous in the hands of The Empire. We must overload the reactor at this library to keep them from ever making use of it. But the only way is to do it manually.""

I'm not saying I am a script genius, but wouldn't those deaths have been way more meaningful to the audience?  I know I would rather have watched that ending.  Battle Beyond the Stars (deep pull there) had most of the characters die off, but each and every one made the decision to go out on their own terms and further the mission.  Yes, Battle Beyond the Stars had a better ending than a multi-million dollar Star Wars movie.

,Pendaelose,,,,,,,,t2_5zbcu,,,"Some answers to the questions asked in this article.

*  Why so many formats?  

How many formats do we use on ONE planet?  We have Spindle Hard Drives, Solid State Hard Drives, CDs, DVDs, BluRay, HDDVD, Zip Drives, Tape Drives, multiple sizes of floppy drives, Audio Cassette, VHS, Betamax, etc...   There are literally hundreds of formats for storing information.  Some are obsolete, some have niche use cases, while others are in direct competition.

*  Why the ""silly"" Data storage facility.

First, as others have pointed out, this is extremely similar to [modern day real life tape storage systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0OXQxbpdUo).  Oh, I guess it's not odd at all to have a massive library of tapes with a robot arm moving them as needed.  Tape backups hold huge amounts of data with excellent shelf life for the data.  There can also be an added advantage in security.  By only connecting the drives when needed it can prevent an unauthorized remote access.   If the Empire kept this data connected the way we keep our home computers connected the rebels would have just sliced the data remotely via holonet and downloaded it.  

The raid was a long shot and even while Jen succeeded it took thousands of rebel lives to complete the mission.  They lost a whole lot of their fleet and all of the ground forces they deployed.  Even with that kind of commitment it took a whole lot of luck for that mission to succeed.  If the rebels tried that same raid 10 times it would have failed the 9 others.

*  Why the ""silly"" manual arm control... Why not just use a terminal somewhere else with a robot controlled arm?

Lets not forget that Jen and friends didn't have access to the front door.  When the Director demanded to see the communications from Urso nobody went running out of the room to fetch individual tapes with a retrieval arm. they just kept working at their terminals, because if you have the front door you just query against meta data like ""Dr. Urso"" and the computer will figure out what tapes are needed, retrieve them, collate the data you need, and present it.  Fully automated and makes lots of sense.

Jen and Cas were using a backdoor to steal the exact tape itself.  K2SO was querying the metadata and telling them what tape they needed.  They weren't asking the computer to fetch it, they were taking it direct from the shelf.  The system would allow this for maintenance reasons, but isn't designed for access this way under normal use.  This is the equivalent of manually walking up to the linked video and taking a tap out of the deck without requesting it via the normal robot.

* Why broadcast from the tower base rather than from an inside terminal.

I'll agree it was silly that the tower base have port for manual broadcast, but it makes sense that Jen and Cas would use it that way.  The network inside the facility was under imperial control.  You can't just remote into the tower and send that data without alerting the whole network to what you are doing.  It makes sense that Jen had to go to the dish, it would make sense if she had to manually align it, and in the real world it would make sense if she hooked a 3rd party device up to that dish for the transmission... the only thing ""silly"" is the movie convenience of the dish having a tape slot at it's base.

* Why was the ""disk"" on the rebel ship smaller?

Maybe it was a read only copy?  DVDs are thinner than Hard Drives. Maybe it was on a less permanent format?  Some data formats last centuries, other lose their data integrity after just a few months of shelf life.  Like the other points, this isn't odd at all once you compare the movie to the real world.  We have lots of data formats that serve different purposes.

* Why didn't they just make more copies?

Burning CDs takes time.  Shit happens, sometimes you gotta go before a 2nd copy can be finished, sometimes you gotta go before Darth Vader chops your head off.

* Why was it so much data in the first place?

Let's stop and consider what it's like designing a massive government project.  The deathstar is a lot like the space shuttle today (just a few million times larger)  The death star plans include every nut and bolt.  Not just where every nut and bolt are used, but what type of nut and bolt, what torque to tighten them with, what stress they will be under, their planned life before replacement, the name of the contractor supplying these nuts and bolts, the lot number of each individual bolt used, the name and contact information for the contractor who installed the individual bolts one at a time.  We do this for military aircraft and spacecraft today...  you can bet your ass the Empire does the same thing. (btw, analyzing this same data for Army helicopters is a big part of my day job, so I'm intimately familiar with how detailed our records are.)

It's also worth considering that the plans themselves likely included a considerable amount of research data with them.  Test firing components of the weapon would likely be very similar to running the LHC today.  The LHC collision data was being produced at approximately 25 petabytes per year, and that with our limited tech today.  I have no doubt the Death Star's weapon test data vastly exceeds our own data and it was collected over a span of decades.  We're talking about an amount of data that is hard to imagine on modern systems.   The fact the empire has data storage systems that allow a person to hand carry that much data is impressive enough already.

This should be obvious, but the animation wasn't the data itself... it was a fuck'n space PDF whipped up quick for the pilot briefing, probably stole the clip from one of the commander's briefs included with the plans.  The actual death star plans were vast and detailed.

* Why are data ports universal when data storage is not?

,The3rdWorld,,,,,,,,t2_3slhr,,,"yeah it's a fascinating topic because there are interesting arguments on both sides - i've read some really interesting things theories about how there may be many evolutionary paths to the same trait - binocular vision for example which is likely to be a peek simply because one eye is too few to generate 3d models while three or more creates computational complexity that adds lag into the system, and as every gamer knows lag is deadly.Even the fly with it's crazy compound eyes is basically translating each eye into a stream of data and comparing that against he other eye's data to generate the off-set and use this as a basic 3d model - it's interesting that we actually went through a stage of evolution where we had three eyes, the [pineal eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye) which is still present in some species seems to have evolved away as our two eyes become more important. 
  
Some features might be a case of 'all roads lead to rome' in that the existential test is the same for everyone, there might actually be a surprising conformity to the late-stage evolution species, it could even be that things like blue skin, wings, and extra bits sticking out all over the place simply aren't practical in a species which has had such an intense evolution to get to the point of intelligence - maybe if the species doesn't get pushed right back to it's limits there's no need for the extra intelligence to develop, and when it does maybe things get so fraught that any weakness or advantage is capitalised on so residual and needless features are quickly whittled away. When you see all these crazy aliens with big deadlock like bits of their body floating all over the place don't you kinda wonder about their evolutionary history, what prompted their evolution of intelligence that didn't also select against waste body-mass and combat absurdity - people have to die in vast numbers for evolution to work, especially on complex traits, each little step up has to be an improvement to the creature that got it, has to increase their rate of survival so that it's not them that dies -- intelligence is useful but being able to outsmart someone to get food is no where near as powerful as not needing the food, so if in your evolutionary moment there's a character that's genetically freakish in that a vestigial or 2ndry protuberance is diminished in a way that makes them more combat effective, able to survive on less food or etc then that person wins out over someone that's a little more philosophical about things... it's not until we've burned off all the easy adaptations that the competition becomes about intellect.  
   
Of course that's only the species born of war and hardship like us, there may be whole other peeks of possibility that develop in other situations, for example peacock's if left to their own devices may well eventually start to compete not by showing off their plumage but by out-smarting each other in how they show off and adorn themselves, it might then lead to peacock society becoming very competitive in this regard and a totally different form of mind will develop - more vain but less violent maybe?

Few people of the fifties saw what computers would evolve into, but i think this has little to do with Heinlein's Slide Rules; rather it is an example of Heinlein's obsession with competence. And it wasn't even science-fiction, or at least not for long; the Apollo astronauts carried Slide Rules.

Here's one of those, from Apollo 13: https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/slide-rule-5-inch-pickett-n600-es-apollo-13

And math done by hand will never become obsolete. The Apollo 13 crew dumped out their data onto paper out of fear their comm and computer systems would go down. They performed manual calculations, and navigated by *sextant, numbers scribbled on paper, and a wristwatch.*

So, the idea of a ""Slipstick Libby"" is neither quaint nor obsolete. At worst, it's a prudent example of the planned redundancy that makes spaceflight somewhat not too unsafe, and as such, it will always be relevant.

There are also reasonably well-known limits on what it can do, whereas I'm not sure of the extent of, say, Gandalf's powers. If Hal can exceed human abilities in a way that's relevant to the story, then I might expect some kind of short, naturalistic explanation of how he is able to, e.g., see certain patterns that humans miss (because as a computer he can crunch Big Data). What can Gandalf do as a wizard? How did he become one? What is the source of magic? Can he cast fireballs? He can create light in his staff. He can help an elf create a great flood which takes the form of humanoid riders. He can conjure a 'white fire' out of his sword to fight demons. Or out of his staff to break a stone bridge. He knows spells that can open various kinds of doors. Saruman can conjure storms. By what mechanism do these things happen, and what makes it so they can do one extraordinary thing but not another?

&gt; Monolith and human evolution - magic

Human evolution is not magic, and the monolith is an alien device that is somehow manipulating our biology. In any sci-fi story, divulging the operating principle of a piece of technology would be tantamount to inventing it. So these things are necessarily left murky. But that doesn't mean it serves the same function as magic. Even if ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"", the level of 'advancement' spoken of can't be quantified on an absolute scale. It's relative.

Because the system is providing at least some relative comfort and security to enough people that they'd rather just keep their head down. I think what's really bothering me is that now I'm having trouble deciding if bureaucracy is possible without implied surveillance--the more bureaucracy there is, the more records there are which can ultimately be centralized, digitized, ingested, analyzed and used as an instrument of power.

Okay, this is tough, because I get your point. I've considered using it in stories I've wanted to write. From a casual (**casual, not causal**) perspective, it does seem to make sense. The thing is, though, when considering the actual physics involved, the actual science behind it, yes, there is what is tantamount to time travel. That is because time progresses at the speed of light. So if you do something faster than time progresses, then you are ""traveling back in time"". 

According to relativity we can disagree on when an event took place. But we can't disagree on the order of two events taking place. If I give you a 54 minute head start warning for a gamma ray burst that hit me and will hit you in an hour, then you'd be happy. But you are seeing the signal as being sent before the gamma ray burst hit me, when it was actually afterward. So I essentially must have gone back in time to send the message.

Even if we talk about using zero width wormholes, where the distance between transmitter and receiver is effectively zero, you've basically just put both systems in a LAN, but instead of being in the same room, they're in different solar systems, and the receiver just gets the information no sooner or later than it would if they *were* in the same room.

A remastering of this show is pretty feasible, but it has the problem of not being as popular as TNG was. It has had a renaissance lately though, so it might be enough to make CBS take the leap. The show does have the secondary problem of having more visual effects, both in quantity and complexity, and at season 5 the show mostly swaps over to using CG or a combination of models and CG. 

The CG would either have to be re-created or somehow restored from files that were rumored to have been lost, [but a guy who worked on the show revealed a few years ago that he had at least a major portion of the files used for the show.](http://trekcore.com/blog/2013/05/deep-space-nine-in-high-definition-one-step-closer/) The question is if Paramount/CBS can work with this guy, and even if they can, if the data is in any sort of state/format that it can be used today for a HD worthy presentation.

Babylon 5:

This is a more problematic case. The show was shot on flat widescreen Super 35mm film which at least gives it the advantage of having a widescreen presentation compared to that of the 80's and 90's Star Trek shows that are forever stuck in 4:3.

The big issue is the CG though. Babylon 5 uses a LOT of CG, with not just full shots but also a lot of set extensions, ie stuff outside of windows or balconies. The CG files are pretty much accepted to be completely lost, which would necessitate a massive undertaking in re-creating all the models and then using those to re-create all the shots in the show. It would probably be even costlier than the already monumental restorations of Star Trek TOS and TNG, for a show that has way less mass-market appeal. Not that it isn't a well-loved cult favorite, but the question remains if that's enough BD sales and attention from services like Netflix to justify the expenses that would require this effort.

And then, apply it to military purpose, reality, causality and counter-measures:

Are your engineered soldiers made to look like you enemies to hide among them, or do they have special features to instill fear, or companionship, or too appear weaker or stronger than they are, or simply to be the most average as possible so they never bring attention to themselves? 

Do you send djinn-looking soldiers to the middle east? Small and young looking women to infiltrate and destroy human trafficking in eastern Europe? Albinos of some specific ethnicity to fight warlords in Sub-Saharian Africa that thinks they're some kind of god or demon, or that it's bad look to kill one or look in their eyes?

Do your soldier see better in the dark so they don't need night-vision googles? If so, how do they fight in the day, and how do the enemy uses it? Do you give them a colder body so that they don't pop out as much in heat sensors, or a hotter one to survive the jungle? Do you give them more explosive metabolism to suddenly a tactical situation or beat five enemies in hand combat, or a slower one they can spend a week without water in the desert, or awake looking down a sniper scope waiting for the target? Do they sweat something that keeps the savana mosquitoes away, or something to hide them from the nose of the enemy's dogs? Do you give them a set of face muscles that helps them act and lie to play any infiltrated role better, or odd ones that they can use to disguise their features from face recognition at every corner in the United States? 

Do you think and guess all those things, or do you decide them uses Big Data that tells you that a specific height and body language and voice pitch has this and that effect on the sub-culture of a small city you're trying to get free of mafia control? And do you just do that to find out what you can use, or do the AI also tells you what would be the best strategy? Consider that genetic engineering of that kind has some technological needs.

Do they have stronger shoulders to swim and climb, or thiner ones to have lower profile during firefights? Are the legs made for faster straight running, or for staying crouched for long periods of time without all that pain and unresponsiveness taking place? Are the veins bigger and stronger to oxygen the muscles at a higher pace, or more spread out so damaged arteries can be shut and other's keep doing their work? 

Do you make them to be more physically efficient for combat (faster, stronger, calmer) and carry more equipment or pull the trigger faster? Or to be easier to save and re-fit in case they're wounded in combat, in order to salvage their training, investment and real-combat experiences? Or so they can hide among the populace and have all they need in their own bodies without having to carry equipment that might give them away?

And then there's the whole psychology of being an engineered soldier, and the ethics, and the public opinion, and how the opposition uses that. What country is it? Is it done for profit alone by a shady company, or was it done with promises of order and safety by a totalitarian state? Or a desperate country under another's rule that saw in it the only solution and made everyone's children into a super-soldier for the future generation to be able to fight back? 

Or was it a country that drove itself into a corner by feeding an arms industry too big for too long, and making it's own army too expensive, and now sees itself forced to keep on buying its weapons in order to maintain its status as oligopsony should they start selling the tech to their potential enemies, and employing it's own army as mercenaries for other nation's and industries interests so it can be partially self-sustainable, despite the populace claims to reduce military spending and activity?

,meltingdiamond,,,,,,,,t2_9ae9f,,,"So, spoilers for The Abyss Beyond Dreams and some guesses for the next book that will almost certainly be right.

Clone Sheldon caused a big explosion in the void at the end of the book, hoping that this would destroy the void, it didn't work. The epilogue reveals that the planet was kicked way the hell away somewhere in the universe so far away that you can't see any stars with the naked eye, some place that isn't in the void because telepathy no longer works. 

This must have happened only a few weeks after original Sheldon started dreaming the void. Original Sheldon had been planning on leaving the commonwealth and really seemed to like the girl so I bet in the next book he does leave the commonwealth and start looking for where the planet has gone, possibly using data from the void watching aliens to get a hint as to where to go. None of this is published to the commonwealth at large because they have not solved the void problem, the Sheldon mission is still ongoing and you don't talk about a secret mission until it succeeds. Also I bet there is going to something really big built out of all the escape pods in the desert, that metal will be a gold mine to a wartime civilization under siege. I still haven't figured out why no colony puzzled have reported back. 

So Sheldon most likely left the commonwealth after waking up to try and rescue his girlfriend/ward and hasn't come back to tell people what he found out about the void. ",1455189197,,czvw5g5,,t3_4577mg,,,t3_4577mg,,1458429029.0,3,,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,,,,,1350107304.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,21930.0,,,,
,ambiturnal,,,,,,,,t2_3mhqb,,,"&gt; what might you expect to see if such a civilization existed? 

I can't say for sure in reality.  I expect that such a discovery would come the other way around - much like in the OP has gone so far.  Assuming that we find alien life (a big assumption), I expect it will take the form our tools are built to detect.  For example, if we build some giant telescopes out in space (Many generations beyond those currently planned), we might recognize that certain areas of some galaxies far away have more heat and less visible light than other areas.  If, on the other hand, we build giant telescopes which can detect the atmospheric components of closer planets, then we might detect some molecules which could not form naturally in those systems.  For example, while the change in CO2 we have caused might be ignorable by scientists on other planets, they probably could not ignore CFC's or other toxic(to us) materials we've left here - they simply could not form randomly in a natural, lifeless planet which happens to have O2 and N2 and CO2 in the quantities they'd be seeing.  In order to produce many of the molecules detectable, they'd have to *also* detect the raw materials which we use to produce them, and those don't exist in the correct quantities.  They'd be pretty sure there is technology going on here.

Likewise, another species looking toward earth wouldn't very likely understand our radio or television programs, but on those frequencies our system is unnaturally bright.  If they detect our radio signals, they might look at first way, way behind us for a dim neutron star or something, before realizing that there is not one, and then looking more closely at the data.  So when I say ""the other way around"" - I mean that it's much better for us to have scientists who want to discover more about neutron stars accidentally find someone *like us* in this way, than it is to randomly choose qualities that are like us and look for them.  Scientific progress isn't really made that way.    So I like the SETI program and others like it, but I think they should expand their scope quite a bit to stay relevant over time, if that helps explain my thinking.",1453166056,,cz3eat0,,t3_41jgo3,,,t1_cz3cymy,,1454580771.0,1,,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,,,,,1252573518.0,,,,0.0,0.0,7.0,2270.0,,,,
,Titan_Astraeus,,,,,,,,t2_3u3l2,,,"This paradox never really sat right with me. Our observational capabilities just aren't that great. We can see very large objects very far away and some smaller stuff in the right conditions. However we don't really have a way to see fine detail. The idea of a Dyson sphere (solid) is pretty impractical, so let's assume we're looking for dyson swarms. Well, does it really *have* to block out a huge percentage of a stars output? Maybe the orientation is such that it would only be visible to us now and then, or even not at all if the swarms not extremely dense. Maybe they use multiple energy source or something we don't even know about or can't detect (geothermal, nuclear?). Space is also very big and we are not as advanced and sophisticated as we think. We've barely scratched the surface and haven't even been looking in depth for very long, there is no way to rule out the possibility just because, practically in our infancy, we haven't seen grand and obvious signs of alien life. 


Edit: also tabbys star is like 1500 ly away. So I guess it would be a pretty good stroke of luck that we happened to look as construction was starting/going on, but for all we know there could be a finished Dyson sphere somewhere out there and that info hasn't reached us yet. It could take hundreds or thousands of years to build such a megastructure and we have no idea what stages they might be in. We have data for the past century on this star and brightness is steadily declining,  maybe it's been declining even longer there's no way we could know. Anyway my point is I think the paradox is overly simplifying a very huge and complex thing saying it can't exist because we can't see it. It's a very human centric point of view when in reality we just have no way of knowing one way or the other.

He could be a life coach and, being good at that, he'd quickly raise up to attempt crazy but very rich celebrities and such.

Personally, I would try to find a way to combine it with data analysis and figure out big things and make big predictions about the future, involving wars, government coups and similar stuff. The photograph constraint makes it difficult but there should be a way to make a lot of money speculating currency exchange rates and such, but that's about how masses of people feel, not how individuals feel. Furthermore, probably just going around somewhere business happens would be easy to get lots of ideas about what people want and need, by ""hearing"" it directly from them, and then using the ability to raise funding to bring solutions to life.

As others have said, reading a person's emotions on theoretical hypothetical situations is the same as mind reading, but also while predicting the future too. Actually finding out how a person *would* feel about a specific thing is **far more** complicated than mind reading. It has to be a magical ability pretty much, something with little difference than seeing the person's picture and knowing when and how they will die.

,FrankManic,,,,,,,,t2_3prbu,,,"On the contrary, I would say that it profoundly failed, and that the ways in which it failed were profoundly important. It was a Star Wars movie in the sense that it had all the things a Star Wars movie is required to have - An X Wing, a Tie Fighter, A Star Destroyer, a Super Weapon, but it lacked any coherence. It threw all the pieces of a Star Wars movie at you one after the other without bothering to see if those pieces formed any real coherent whole or told a story worth telling. 

Simple questions like ""What is the scope of the First Order"" or ""What is the relation of the Republic to the Resistance"" are not merely unanswered by apparently dismissed as unimportant.

Why is there a super-weapon? Well, apparently just because that's what you do in Star Wars. No one in the movie has any connection or concern for the worlds destroyed. It is just in the movie.. because. Just because. It isn't really part of the plot, it's just a side show. An excuse to have a spectacle. In IV the Death Star is critical to the plot. It is established clearly that the Empire is universal in scope and wields vast power, and that the Rebellion is small and in a precarious position. If the Death Star is completed unopposed it will crush the Rebellion. 

Okay. There we go. We know why it's important. The Rebellion needs to destroy the Death Star or the Empire wins. 

In VII? Well, there's these First Order guys. It's not clear who they are or whether they're in control of anything, but it's kind implied that they're just The Empire II: Electric Boogaloo. But wait, you say, wasn't the Empire decisively defeated at the Battle of Endor? Well... who knows? The movie doesn't address it at all, in any way. 

But there are these first order guys, and they're *bad guys*, because they kill civilians and blew up these planets. 

And... There's ""The Resistance"". And apparently they're... resisting the Frst Order? But didn't someone also mention The Republic? Why isn't the Republic resisting the First Order? Is the Republic the Resistance? If they are, why is it called The Resistance instead of, you know, the Republic Military?

I mean, I could go on. And on and on and on. Because this movie was presented in a way that implies the creators didn't really care about their setting, or their plot. In a fashion that seems to be very much Jar Jar Abrahms thing the plot is just a contrivance to make loud noises and flashy explosions happen. The movie kept trying to tell a story and the plot was frankly in the way. Which is a shame because the characters are quite good. They're mostly interesting (except Poe Dameron, whose role in the story was utterly superfluous and could have been cleanly eliminated by just having BB-8 get the data on its own and having Finn, you know, jump in an escape pod). Rei is cool, Finn is cool, Han and Chewie are cool, it's nice to see Leia again. Ren is interesting because he shows the Dark Side as it is - Scared, angry people retreating in to their own fear and self loathing instead of dealing with their problems. 

But... I mean... 

The best way I can put it is that most of the movie, the realy big parts of the movie, the plot, the setting, the story it was trying to tell, they were a paint by numbers. They took a list of ""10 things you find in a Star Wars"" movie and went right down the list without any passion or sincerity, and the result was a movie that failed *in spite of* good acting, good costumes, good sets, good creatures, good FX, even good dialogue. It's just empty, at the end. All the good things are in service of an empty story that doesn't have anything new or interesting to say. It's a soulless re-hash of the plot of IV without even being a coherent soulless re-hash of the plot of four.

Ask yourself this - Why is it significant that they find Luke Skywalker? 

Luke's role in the Rebellion was that of a fighter squadron leader and occaisional special-forces soldier. That's it. Leia, Han, Calrissian, Mothma, and Akbar was the *leaders* of the Rebellion. They were the political drivers. They lead the capital fleets. They were important. So why is everyone so fixed on finding Luke? 

Well... Umm... Just, cause? I guess? I mean, maybe the badguy wants to kill him or confront him or something? 

TLDR; There was a super-weapon made out of an entire planet that could destroy entire star systems and the good-guys couldn't even muster as many forces as they used to bring down the first death star. Apparently the forces of good have no capital ships, no B-wings, no Y-wings, frigates. Apparently they've got *twelve X-wings* (and the continuity guys couldn't even be assed to keep that number consistent)",1451192741,,cych71q,,t3_3yb9o4,,,t1_cyc64oy,,1451875651.0,40,,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,,,,,1257813370.0,,,,0.0,0.0,2.0,22659.0,,,,

Is that enough?  No idea and it probably depends on what data exactly is being collected. Estimates of the data on the internet are around 1e18 bytes. If you really want to collect all the data of a civilization and that civilization is nearly as advanced as the one that produced the ship, it won't be possible. They've probably got more than one ship.  


But maybe you only want to collect worthwhile scientific data and the like. That we can at least ballpark.  Let's say you want to catalogue the genome and proteome of every organism on the planet.  Let's say there's 10 million species with an average of 1 billion 2-bit base pairs to their genome ( I think that is a big overestimate of the size of the average genome on earth, but maybe you want to have records of genetic diversity).

When I say fast, I mean fast. Like, there is no reasonable defense against an object heading towards you at near light speed. A crayola crayon (2 grams) at 99% the speed of light packs 2×10¹⁴ Joules of energy. 

One gram of TNT has about 4×10³ Joules of energy. So the equivalent amount of TNT when our crayon hits the earth is on the order of 8×10¹⁰ grams of TNT. 80 megatonnes. The largest nuke ever developed had 25 megatonnes (B41). 

Launching a crayola crayon wipes out major cities. Launching a 96 colour pack destroys the environment and instigated nuclear winter. Relativistic energy is no joke. God forbid you launch a few kilograms at a time - punch mountain sides holes in planets. A small asteroid cracks a planet in half. 

An incoming crayon at 0.99c is travelling at such high speeds that the light that it is pushing in front of it arrives only moments before it hits. There's no need for stealth. No radar system can detect something that small (it's cross section is smaller than radar wavelengths). You just die without warning.

The only defense is a satellite swarm which cuts off the entire view of the stars and lets no light in. This swarm needs to be several layers thick and moving erratically, or they just launch crayons in quick succession to punch through the holes. 

Basically, living on a planet gets you killed. There is no need to have infantry or tanks when your artillery wins the war in the first moment.

If someone who understands this better thinks I'm wrong then do correct me, but I *think* you'd have to move the Moon down to below geosynchronous orbit in order to have tidal drag actually lower the orbit rather than raise it. That way it's low enough that it moves overhead faster than the Earth below, so it's being constantly pulled back (and therefore lower) by the part of Earth it's passing over, rather than being dragged forward (and therefore outward) by it.

Geosynchronous orbit is a bit over 90% of the way down to Earth from Lunar orbit.

[],Falldog,,,[],,,,text,t2_3e6y9,False,,"So, after thinking about this all night, I keep coming back to one thing, the the antimatter pulses, otherwise known as the worst McGuffin in movie history.

First off, from a scientific perspective, it doesn't make a damned bit of sense. Most of the other scientific flaws can be explained away for expediency of film making, or dramatic effect (either of which I would still argue against). But in this universe they somehow have a bunch of antimatter on an exploration ship that's supposed to be looking for life outside of the solar system (never mind that they don't get anywhere beyond the heliosphere as mentioned). What purpose does it serve when the ship is basically just gathering visual light and other sensor data from far off solar systems? Why is the antimatter connected to a big parabolic dish? Why is that dish pointed back into the solar system?

From a narrative perspective, and this is way more frustrating in ways, it makes even less sense. It's literally just tacked in there to provide an excuse for Roy to go find his father. Literally the textbook definition of McGuffin. The effort that's done up front to highlight the impact of the pulse, and it's risk, and the severity of the situation, so so casually waved away at the very end. Okay, the core theme is Roy confronting his father and coming to terms with himself, but you can't just hand wave away the core driving factor that lead to that situation. There are so many other ways you could have written Roy's revelation, but by forcing him to confront his dad, you also have to handle the requirements for doing so. By simply pushing all that aside it undermines the entire event. It's so abruptly dismissed that the entire thread of ""is your a hero or not"" goes fucking nowhere and just outright just dropped. 

At the core you have a very simple structure of a man who's been isolated from the world around him, largely in part due to the loss of his father.

Not really, you're overlooking or simplifying details to try and make it work. I've read the comic, I know it's not supposed to explain away plot holes, I'm saying it introduces them, as whoever is in charge of maintaining consistent stories in current canon is useless. 

They literally fight by the mines, leave behind on the planet a base with a working shield generator, as well as trenches (some complete, some half-formed), Ski-Speeders, and gun emplacements. It wasn't to be a random base, but their next main base, which when abandoned was switched to be Hoth. You think the Empire wouldn't log a skirmish? Or check out the planet after SCAR Squadron limped away? Wouldn't discover the big-ass door with a military base behind it? Rebels tells us that effective shield generators are too valuable to just be left around if one can avoid it. The Rebels would not have left one there if they thought they could return without reprisal from the Empire.

The mere sight of Shield Generator brings Vader and his fleet down on Hoth, you think they would just ignore Crait after encountering the Rebellion's heroes there? Do you think they wouldn't interrogate Trusk Berinato about why he knew the Rebels were there?

That shit is going straight into the records. The fact that the Empire knows about Rebel involvement with the planet in any capacity should be enough for them to be suspicious, what they did encounter should make the First Order keenly aware they might try something with it.

&gt; But the Resistance didn't jump to Crait.

Which is why I said the Crait system, which is what they have their slow chase through, which the Tracker had to tell them they were jumping to. If it was a random piece of space, it wouldn't have any data to sift through and project would it? Which would tell them they were in the Crait system, and that the planet they would later be going by would be Crait.

It doesn't take much for it all to fall apart, even you mentioned how Leia isn't consistent from the Claudia Gray novel to this comic. 

As far as the planet goes, the Empire knew about it and its connection to the Rebels, and would have easily discovered that there was something there.

[],_TheRedViper_,,,[],,,,text,t2_e9zkj,False,,"&gt; Not really. We can have objections while still being closer or farther from truth for example or we can achieve almost 100% certain truths (truth that I exist, truth that I like strawberry ice-cream and so on). After all most people believe that external world exists, most people are realists about science and have strong commitment towards truth, not substitutes.

How do you make sure you ever are justified in these believes with the limitations in mind. We can be pragmatic about it, i think it makes sense to be, but ultimately that's a weaker position out of necessity.  
  
&gt;  Well, disagreement isn't itself evidence for no objectivity. In case of aesthetics it is the scale of disagreement and that people with similar extensive training and exposure to art can have very different opinions or even if they agree they attach different weight and value to recognized properties. We disagree about truth of many things but for us despite that it's not just ""our opinion"". In the same way even though aesthetic anti-realists disagree that aesthetic value is objective they still endorse objectivism in other disciplines like epistemology, science or math.  
  
Sounds like disagreement to me, now you can put qualifiers around it to make it more precise, which is fine, but ultimately it's just that.  
I don't particularly think that it's a strong objection, especially because one can attack other disciplines in similar ways.  
  
&gt;  That's a big bullet to chew on. Most people and philosophers working in metaethics believe that morality is objective and despite several theories for moral anti-realism most conclude (even from anti-realism camp) that moral realism is a much stronger position. Logic though it is human construct is indispensable when it comes to achieving truth and being rational and we seem to be commited to it (better or worse) from birth so it's not just ""our opinion"". Discipline of mathematics even if socially constructed according to most mathematicians and philosophers of math is focused on discovering and proving mathematical truths that are out there meaning that they endorse mathematical objectivity. So we get 2+2=4 not because we agreed upon it, not because subjectivity is scary and not because we need a framework to talk about stuff but because it's true.  
  
All of these positions are pragmatic though, aren't they? Which is fine with me as i said before, but i have a hard time talking about objectivity and truth when in reality it's just the best we have. Morality is extremely linked to naturalistic arguments as far as i am aware, always trying to leave the is-ought gap behind with common sense and subjective feelings more than anything.  
  
&gt;  I still I'm not entirely sure what do you mean by that, especially given what I said above. In logic or math our frameworks are there to achieve end goal which is truth and judging by all the advances we made, all the machinery that works we do fine and these frameworks are all fine and dandy. But in art our end goal is appreciation, pleasure. So if you want really to talk about objectivity there you must endorse what aesthetic realists endorse: that there are real objective properties like beauty, sublime that give us pleasure and properties like ugliness and sentimentalism that give us displeasure. These properties are not a matter of opinion so by not recognizing them in an artwork and not appreciating them correctly you're making mistake just like you would make a mistake by getting 5 out of 2+2 but it is not clear whether you endorse that or not.  
  
I am not truly fine with endorsing that, or at least i don't think we could ever prove anything like this, just like i don't think we can ever prove other properties we perceive as truthful.  
We can define things without real justification and work from there though while trying to stay consistent in the frameworks we built. Under that caveat i am fine with endorsing it.  
  
&gt;  Deep consensus is rarely achieved but at any given time one position might be stronger or weaker. Currently in philosophical discourse for example atheism is stronger posisition than theism, moral realism is stronger than moral anti-realism and scientific realism is stronger than scientific anti-realism. Weaker positions are not disproved or whatever so chances are that they are redeemable but with current state of our knowledge the other ones have much more going for them. In aesthetics objectivism was the stronger position until recently too but the first two studies I linked will probably change this trend.  
  
Sure positions can be stronger or weaker but as long as there is a strong opposition i have a hard time being comfortable to pretend that any position is right or wrong (even under the already laid out objections to begin with).  
So you'd say it is fair to say that there is no consensus, there is even a stronger position for objectivism.  
You speculate that trend will change based on empirical data though, which is also interesting to me tbh, almost like sam harris trying to bring in neuroscience into morality.  
  
&gt;  And subjectivity itself doesn't mean that we can't have better or worse judgements or we can't talk about craft for example. We consider humor and food to be purely subjective things and yet we learn stand-up comedy, we learn how to cook, we have food critics and so on.

Are you trying to suggest that this isn't how silicon valley works? :) Silicon valley is also a gated industry. Perhaps in the beginning yes, the internet was an open opportunity for anyone with an idea. It's not like that anymore. Venture capital controls everything.  But we shouldn't kid ourselves that silicon valley and the tech industry will be the saviours of cinema. 

Remember in the early days of the Internet we dreamed of how the Net was going to democratize access to things like News and we would no longer be under the shackles of large news and media organisations. The internet held such promise, it was going to tear down walls and destroy corporate power. Hurray! 

Except that's not what happened. 

Today we just have different corporate overlords. And algorithms are deciding what news and content we consume, who we interact with, who gets visibility and who doesn't. Data and algorithms are used to decide everything. Corporations like Facebook now are in positions where information can be manipulated to the point where they can influence election outcomes. Yeah, I don't think we should be cheering for the tech industry to be taking over independent cinema. This bullshit about how the internet can transform traditional industries for the positive betterment of society is a message from 15-20 years ago. Today we know better. 

Personally, I could care less if silicon valley wants to take over the role of big Hollywood studios. Those guys were a mafia anyway. But this debate isn't about Hollywood. It's about independent filmmaking and ensuring that filmmakers have not just have access to funding to get their films made but they also have an outlet to show their work. Film festivals and independent cinema are one of the last bastions of free expression and one of the few avenues through which storytelling can challenge/expose/resist the narratives of the powerful. Western society is at a critical crossroad, where so much of the information and content we consume is being used to control and manipulate us. The last thing we need is the tech industry taking over independent cinema. 

So we shouldn't kid ourselves that this battle in film festivals is a battle between Hollywood and silicon valley. It's not. The big studios were never really that invested in independent cinema anyway and they have already squeezed it out of the big corporate cinema chains.

Oh look, another box office expert. Right, ok - except how many blockbuster films were ever dropping in December before Disney decided to make it Star Wars month? There's Avatar - but by all accounts that was an anomaly and made most of its money by having long legs. Statistically, it's an outlier. In fact, Star Wars making as much as it did in December was pretty crazy when it happened. But I've discussed this topic to death so I'm just going to copy and paste the answer:

It's not a perfect film but it's certainly one of the stronger entries in the 11 films we've got to pick from. And it's certainly well about the prequels: the prequels are bad films.

But let's look at why it's performance can't be based on the financial success of TFA:

TFA was an ""event"" for a variety of reasons which is why it cannot be used as a reliable metric for comparison of performance. It was

The first Disney produced Star Wars Film

First new Star Wars film in a Decade

First film advertising the return of Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher since Return of the Jedi in the 80s

First film without George Lucas and First film after the critically reviled prequels.

The hype was ridiculous and the circumstances were exceptional for that performance. The Last Jedi was always going to make less than the Force Awakens. So you saying ""it made less than 2/3 of TFA's total gross"" literally means nothing in a discussion about its performance especially if you don't understand the idea of a data outlier. The best metric of performance would have been to average TFA with Rogue One's performance to get a ballpark idea of the ceiling. Your comments also act like 1 billion dollar films are so common: they're actually the exception.

But if you really want to pretend that your argument has merit, let's look at Star Wars historically:

Star Wars: - domestic: $307,263,857

foreign: $314,400,000

total: $621,663,857

Empire Strikes Back: - domestic: $209,398,025

foreign $247,900,000

total: $457, 298,025

Return of the Jedi: - domestic: $252,583,617

foreign: $165,800,000

total: $ 418,383,617

Hmmm, weird. There's a downward trend in the performance of the films from film to film! But that can't possibly apply to the modern films...obviously TLJ's performance has everything to do with how you personally feel about the story told!

Let's try again with the films which were actually poor quality!

Phantom Menace: - domestic: $431,088,295

foreign: $493.2 million

total: $924.3 million worldwide

Attack of the Clones: - domestic:$310,676,740

foreign: $338,721,588

total: $649,398,328

Revenge of the Sith: - domestic: $380,270,577

foreign: $460 million

total: $849 million

Straight from the Attack of the Clones wikipedia page: Though a financial success, it was nevertheless overshadowed by the even greater box-office success of The Phantom Menace three years earlier.

Every second film in a saga trilogy has performed less than the film that came before. In fact, I'm also willing to bet that a significant chunk of the audience that didn't like The Force Awakens didn't go see The Last Jedi when it came out either - which also probably accounts for the dip in numbers as well.



&gt; The only thing it's asinine to do is to pretend that weekly holds don't matter if the film has the worst ones of the entire series.

lol, that's a big ""if"".

And the fact of the matter is, the only metrics that can support comparing all the films will only ever be ticket count.

Weeklies for the film do not matter: the only measure of success isn't retention - it's overall performance.

&gt; the film has the worst ones of the entire series

Now I'm willing to bet that you have never in your life looked at the weeklies for any of the original trilogy films or even the prequel trilogies and you're just parroting a line someone else said to sound smart and support your shared narrative that the film sucks, was bad, whatever gets your little pecker going.

Buuuut if you look at the actual weeklies for the OT, you'd quickly realize that you can't compare them. - https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&amp;id=starwars4.htm - https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&amp;id=starwars5.htm - https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&amp;id=starwars6.htm

I'll even save you the hassle of critical thinking since you need others to think for you: ***there is a weekly expansion in theater count for those films - as well as the Phantom Menace - which ultimately make the comparison worthless because the films were playing in more theaters while also drawing in less money.

And that's not even touching on the variability in - release date: the prequels got May release dates whereas Rogue One, TFA and TLJ all got December release dates. - competition

O Brother, for example, appears as high as 4th best in some lists to as low as 4th worst in others. I was curious to see exactly how much consensus there is for each movie's ranking.

The graph shows average ranking on the x-axis with the standard deviation for those rankings on the y-axis. That means the lower the point appears on the graph, the more people agree on its ranking. 

Some analysis:

* If there's one thing people agree on, it's that they don't like The Ladykillers.
* If there's another thing people agree on, it's that they don't like Intolerable Cruelty.
* The two movies with the most disagreement are Raising Arizona and O Brother. Raising Arizona has rankings ranging from 1st to 12th place, O Brother has rankings from 4th to 15th place.
* Fargo and No Country are basically indistinguishable at the top with nearly the same rank and high levels of consensus. The Big Lebowski is a clear third place.
* There's a weird amount of consensus that Barton Fink is neither one of their absolute best movies nor one of their absolute worst.

Boring stuff:

The x-axis is scaled between 0 and 1 to account for lists that were missing Buster Scruggs. The best-ranked movie is given a value of 1 while the worst-ranked is given a value of 0 regardless of how many movies appear in the list.

[],PretendCamp,,,[],,,,text,t2_4gnwq6ab,False,,"&gt;I have no idea how Netflix can compete with this, especially at that price.

Netflix has a shot. Everyone should \*\*want\*\* Netflix to succeed. Competition is good not only for the consumer, but also for the industry as a whole.  

  

Netflix has a big running start in this digital space. They already have tons of customers, a strong brand, a huge library, and tons of data (years and years of viewer analytics which they can market, sell, and use. Data that lots of people, including the traditional tv networks, don't have).  

  

Right now there's kind of this gold rush to this new digital space to compete and try to shut out Netflix or at least cut into profits. Will Disney be successful? I think they definitely have a pretty good shot. Amazon does too. Apple? I think they can make a run for it -- tons of money and again, tons of data due to their tech eco-bubble (iphone, macs, apps, store, apple tv, etc.), and tons of fan boys -- so I think they definitely have a chance, but the real threat is whether they'll have enough content to compete. And don't even get me started on the Apple TV+ app... it has some issues... 



The other players may try to start their own services -- and lots of them have said that they would (NBC for example), but I think as Disney and Apple reach the space, people are going to realize it's starting to get crowded as shit. Lots of content owners will just stick with licensing and what's been working. Why wouldn't they? Building, launching, and maintaining a streaming app/service is super expensive. High risk, high reward. A lot won't want to dip their hat in that. And why would they when they can just continue doing what they've been doing -- produce content and shop it around town to the highest bidder.  

  

Netflix right now is kind of hurting. But they saw this coming. They've been reinvesting all of their money into production and green-lighting any and every project (notice how they're making lots of just... mediocre shit?). They know that lots of people like different things and that they need a ton of content ASAP before everybody starts pulling their shit from their service. They had to become a content creator and get to the source rather than be the middle man / drug dealer.  

&amp;#x200B;

All Netflix really has to do is stop green-lighting everything, and then offer quality &gt; quantity and lower their prices (which they can because right now all of their money is being funneled right back into production). Slow down production, focus on quality control, lower prices, and **voilà**.

[],LuminaTitan,,,[],,,,text,t2_96mqn,False,,"**Memories of Murder (2003)**

Who Watches the Watchers? Many of the most effective crime and serial killer films or works of art are never truly resolved. We’re told this right at the beginning of this film, which is based on a real-life series of murders that remain unsolved to this day. The identity of who the “real” killer is, becomes subordinate to the dark journey itself into the heart of something truly evil that manages to feel both unknowable and yet completely banal in how sudden and ordinary it can emerge out of nowhere. There’s a disruptive quality to these horrific acts that’s so contrary to our regularly accepted reality of ideals, laws, and morals. The mass shared belief that if we follow the system and live a good, honest life, then things will work out smoothly for us as it’s meant to. These types of shocking acts reveal just how easily someone or something can not only disrupt your (or anyone else’s) life at any time, but the entire belief system that we collectively follow in order for our larger society to properly function.

This isn’t just effective as a serial killer, crime procedural film. Like “Zodiac” there’s a great emphasis put on the archaic, dated forensic methods of the time that a rural, backwater police department is forced to rely upon. There’s also great fleshed-out characterization, albeit a bit cliché, of the three main characters: a semi-educated detective named Park Doo-man (played by Song Kang-ho), his uneducated and violent partner Cho Yong-koo (played by Kim Roi-ha), and a college educated detective from Seoul named Seo Tae-yoon (played by Kim Sang-Kyung). Recently arrived from the big city, detective Seo is straight-laced and by the book, and relies entirely upon data as his primary bulwark of infallibility. Detective Park on the other hand, disdains that sort of academic knowledge in favor of a folksy sort of intuition and wordly experience, proclaiming that he can always identify whether someone is telling the truth simply by gazing into their eyes (this motif about eyes and seeing is important to note).

From the several other Bong Joon-Ho movies I’ve seen, it seems that he really excels at characterization. Despite the clichéd setting and cop character archetypes, they all manage to have their own unique sense of individuality, and this clash of ideals between them predictably leads to a lot of conflict, but also a lot of humorous situations as well. There’s a lot of moments of levity in this film, which adds to the shock, when on a dime, the movie would take a complete 180 degree turn with several truly dark moments. There are a couple of sequences here that are as thrilling and suspenseful as any crime film ever made.

However, there’s a fascinating thing that Bong Joon-Ho did regarding eyes, memory, and the act of watching. This movie is a stunning, interconnected Mobius strip of watching and surveillance, which is where the repeated motif of eyes comes into play. There’s a lot of scenes where the detectives stake out and watch suspects or locations, but we’re also shown the perspective from the mysterious killer several times. There’s an amazing, yet horrible scene where the killer skulks about in the shadows of a forest, intensely watching (along with us, the audience) two potential female victims walk by. They're both characters who are connected to the detectives and we feel at least a slight emotional connection to them. While he’s choosing his target, we ourselves are in his place, perhaps grimly preferring him to choose one over the other, because of this emotional connection we may have to either of them. The act of memories is also greatly incorporated into the film and intertwined with the act of watching. One of the suspects is mentally challenged and is beaten and led to recall memories of a murder that could also have been forcibly implanted by the detectives who are desperate to find any suspect amidst a growing public outcry. Another possible suspect is challenged on his memory of a particular radio program that could possibly tie him to the murder. And to take this into an entirely new dimension, the director himself said that he partially created this movie knowing that the real murderer was undoubtedly going to watch it, and return back to the *scene of the crime* to relive and compare his memories, and Bong Joon-ho wanted to let him know that the country and people involved do not forget as well. There’s a scene that directly comments on this (and you’ll know it when you see it) that could be one of the most incredible Meta moments in all of cinematic history, and certainly the most powerful in how it’s reflecting something back onto the real world, onto both an audience of many, as well as an audience of one.

This an exemplary work of the genre, alongside other films like “M,” or “Zodiac,” not just because of how it skillfully maintains a slightly humorous yet always gripping tone. It’s also because of how it plays with the concept of watching, and subtly entwines it into the narrative itself, turning it for and against the characters, but also toward the audience as well. As I mentioned in the beginning, the best serial killer films and works of art, are not simply focused on finding the identity of who the killer really is. It’s about the unsettling examination of the banality of evil, and the killers among us that easily pass our detection. And it's about the descent into the unfathomable regions of darkness lurking inside us, that we often avert our gaze from, in order to better function by the conscious guiding light and principles of day.",1566748433,{},ey2u7lp,False,t3_cv9nmn,False,True,t3_cv9nmn,/r/movies/comments/cv9nmn/what_is_the_best_film_you_watched_last_week/ey2u7lp/,1566748442.0,1,True,,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd still consider this a time of trial, growth, and learning for Netflix. I think it's still building a content library to collect data on which types of shows are good/watched and which shows are best at reaching specific market segments. This means that Netflix isn't spending too much on any single show and is spending a lot of money on different types of inferior shows to see where they should focus more in the future. 

Hopefully, when they stop the research portion of their development, they'll start to invest more into fewer but higher quality shows. I think House of Cards was their greatest show that was on par with HBO, followed by Narcos and Ozarks.

&gt;""Hey, Case,"" she said, barely voicing the words, ""you listening? Tell you a story. . . Had me this boy once. You kinda remind me. . ."" She turned and surveyed the corridor. ""Johnny, his name was."" The low, vaulted hallway was lined with dozens of museum cases, archaic-looking glass-fronted boxes made of brown wood. They looked awkward there, against the organic curves of the hallway's walls, as though they'd been brought in and set up in a line for some forgotten purpose. Dull brass fixtures held globes of white light at ten-meter intervals. The floor was uneven, and as she set off along the corridor, Case realized that hundreds of small rugs and carpets had been put down at random. In some places, they were six deep, the floor a soft patchwork of handwoven wool. Molly paid little attention to the cabinets and their contents, which irritated him. He had to satisfy himself with her disinterested glances, which gave him fragments of pottery, antique weapons, a thing so densely studded with rusted nails that it was unrecognizable, frayed sections of tapestry. . . ""My Johnny, see, he was smart, real flash boy. Started out as a stash on Memory Lane, chips in his head and people paid to hide data there. Had the Yak after him, night I met him, and I did for their assassin. More luck than anything else, but I did for him. And after that, it was tight and sweet, Case."" Her lips barely moved. He felt her form the words; he didn't need to hear them spoken aloud. ""We had a set-up with a squid, so we could read the traces of everything he'd ever stored. Ran it all out on tape and started twisting selected clients, ex-clients. I was bagman, muscle, watchdog. I was real happy. You ever been happy, Case? He was my boy. We worked together. Partners. I was maybe eight weeks out of the puppet house when I met him. . ."" She paused, edged around a sharp turn and continued. More of the glossy wooden cases, their sides a color that reminded him of cockroach wings. ""Tight, sweet, just ticking along, we were. Like nobody could ever touch us. I wasn't going to let them. Yakuza, I guess, they still wanted Johnny's ass. 'Cause I'd killed their man. 'Cause Johnny'd burned them. And the Yak, they can afford to move so fucking slow, man, they'll wait years and years. Give you a whole life, just so you'll have more to lose when they come and take it away. Patient like a spider. Zen spiders."" ""I didn't know that, then. Or if I did, I figured it didn't apply to us. Like when you're young, you figure you're unique. I was young. Then they came, when we were thinking we maybe had enough to be able to quit, pack it in, go to Europe maybe. Not that either of us knew what we'd do there, with nothing to do. But we were living fat, Swiss orbital accounts and a crib full of toys and furniture. Takes the edge off your game."" ""So that first one they'd sent, he'd been hot. Reflexes like you never saw, implants, enough style for ten ordinary hoods. But the second one, he was, I dunno, like a monk. Cloned. Stone killer from the cells on up. Had it in him, death, this silence, he gave it off in a cloud. . ."" Her voice trailed off as the corridor split, identical stairwells descending. She took the left. ""One time, I was a little kid, we were squatting. It was down by the Hudson, and those rats, man, they were big. It's the chemicals get into them. Big as I was, and all night one had been scrabbling under the floor of the squat. Round dawn somebody brought this old man in, seams down his cheeks and his eyes all red. Had a roll of greasy leather like you'd keep steel tools in, to keep the rust off. Spread it out, had this old revolver and three shells. Old man, he puts one bullet in there, then he starts walking up and down the squat, we're hanging back by the walls."" ""Back and forth. Got his arms crossed, head down, like he's forgotten the gun. Listening for the rat. We got real quiet. Old man takes a step. Rat moves. Rat moves, he takes another step. An hour of that, then he seems to remember his gun. Points it at the floor, grins, and pulls the trigger. Rolled it back up and left."" ""I crawled under there later. Rat had a hole between its eyes."" She was watching the sealed doorways that opened at intervals along the corridor. ""The second one, the one who came for Johnny, he was like that old man. Not old, but he was like that. He killed that way."" The corridor widened. The sea of rich carpets undulated gently beneath an enormous candelabrum whose lowest crystal pendant reached nearly to the floor. Crystal tinkled as Molly entered the hall. THIRD DOOR LEFT, blinked the readout. She turned left, avoiding the inverted tree of crystal. ""I just saw him once. On my way into our place. He was coming out. We lived in a converted factory space, lots of young comers from Sense/Net, like that. Pretty good security to start with, and I'd put in some really heavy stuff to make it really tight. I knew Johnny was up there. But this little guy, he caught my eye, as he was coming out. Didn't say a word. We just looked at each other and I knew. Plain little guy, plain clothes, no pride in him, humble. He looked at me and got into a pedicab. I knew. Went upstairs and Johnny was sitting in a chair by the window, with his mouth a little open, like he'd just thought of something to say.""

[],velvetreddit,,,[],,,,text,t2_yp8q6,False,,"I think there is a difference between being able to play any part you want to express with your art versus big Hollywood predominantly casting certain people for the majority of roles. There has been a major restriction on who gets to have lead roles in high budget films. Also, there has been a lot of focus on certain types of family backgrounds seen in a positive light while everyone else is stereotyped rather than nuanced. 

I don’t need to be of a certain culture to empathize and relate. But seeing the same types of actors and characters doesn’t give me enough to relate to holistically with all my content consumption. Why is this important? We learn through role models and mimic a lot of behavior we see. The more and more we are exposed to diverse narratives and people in our media, the less afraid we have to be of “those people.” Media controls a lot of the narrative we put on the world to help us make sense of it whether we are aware of it or not. 

I love stories played by a wide variety of humans to relate to and remind me we have a lot in common as much as I love stories from people who reflect my culture as an American with an intersection of culture in my background. My favorite narratives and actors lately have been told through a variety of people lately and it’s so refreshing. I think there is a place for everyone, especially with personalized content and accessibility with media today. 

In any industry, there is always an issue of time, budget, and liability. People tend to hire people they know who can do the role rather than using resources to really do the research to find the right person who might bring something else to the table. It happens in every job market I’ve seen. It’s why we see the same circles of talent and the same folks being funded to make films. I’m glad the industry is becoming more self aware of this. People should continue to ask for this - consumer products are made for consumers. Sure it’s to make money but ultimately it’s to make money through what entertains you most. 

The shitty thing is when we have algorithms telling us what we want based on quantitative data because it doesn’t allow for much change. This is why conversations like this and exploring new content outside of the algorithm (ads, Spotify suggestions, top suggestions, etc) is so important. Take the time to throw off the machine and give it some random variables - it’s only as smart as you allow it to be. You can get mad at the system and remain complacent or you can put effort into evolving.

Battleship, to me, IS VERY APPEALING in many ways. I’m not going to make a list, but, for the sake of argument, let’s say there are 42 individual things that I love about it.

On the other hand, the faults that it has are also numerous, and in some cases, like overall story being bad, a single fault bears more weight because it’s a bigger component. Maybe there’s about 25 things that I really take issue with, with some of them being major problems. (Again, just for the sake of discussion.)

So at the same time, it both appeals to me AND repels me. More realistically, it’s a scene by scene push and pull. When I watch it I want to fast forward dumb parts to get to the awesome parts. 

Not trying to sound pretentious or anything (I am defending Battleship, after all), but I’d like to think that nothing that is objectively well made would ever repel me. That leaves my enjoyment of it as a matter of subjective taste. Maybe it’s good quality, but I don’t like the nature of the content. My opinion doesn’t make it bad, it’s just not my cup of tea.

Meanwhile something can be objectively poor quality (bad filmmaking, bad writing, etc.) but still be subjectively appealing. Maybe I just like the content, or the characters, or whatever. They make me ignore the technical flaws. 

In the simplest of spectrums, there’s high, average, and low, right?

So a film can have high, average, or low subjective appeal. 

A film can also have high, average, or low, objective quality. 

They’re different measures.

A film with average appeal and average quality is destined to be forgotten, like a direct to video release or a Lifetime original movie. 

A film with high quality and low appeal (Manchester by the Sea) can win awards.

A film with low quality and high appeal can make a billion dollars.

A low-low can become a cult favorite like The Room.

A high-high can become a cultural moment or a masterpiece for the ages.

The big picture you’re considering is the sum total of the two separate values that I’m talking about.

The problem is when doing that math, as I pointing out above, things can get lost in translation. That’s why I hold them apart for detailed assessment, rather than combining them.

Think of it like the Critics score and the audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Sometimes they’re aligned, but sometimes they’re wildly different. Which holds more value? How would you go about normalizing disparate scores?

&gt;Star Trek: Discovery’s performance doesn’t bode well for the future of CBS All Access. The data suggests one big exclusive show is not enough to keep subscriber growth on track to pass CBS’s 2020 goal. To do that the company will have to keep releasing big-budget shows through the service.

The basic idea made plenty of sense, and the prices here are still only $7-14 more than it was, plus 10% off concessions, which is going to knock a few bucks off for a lot of people. If I were to buy it, it went from slightly less than one movie's ticket price to slightly more, and that difference is definitely not the margin that the theaters are chasing.

Most people don't see even one movie a month (and most that see more see only one), and a lot of those people aren't going to notice a $10 charge, and a lot of those who notice aren't going to cancel it since, as you point out, it's around a single movie ticket's price - they're just going to resolve to go see a movie or two next month (and then likely never get around to it again). That was especially true for MoviePass (at least in urban areas with ticket prices over $10) because when you're considering whether to cancel it or not, you don't have to ask yourself if you'll see two movies next month - if you see a single one it was worth it. That money goes straight into their pocket.

And then they can also sell data. And MoviePass was looking at selling data from competing theaters - data each theater chain can't normally get on their own. That's even more money.

But the big thing was that they were looking to get discounts from theaters, which is not particularly crazy since *that's already a thing*. Look at CostCo movie tickets - they're about $30 for a 4-pack. MoviePass was $10, and most people do not see more than one or two movies a month, if that. If you only see one movie a month, the CostCo tickets are *cheaper* than MoviePass was - and that's not because CostCo decided to take a big loss on movie tickets for no reason. Theaters have clear reasons to offer discounted tickets: you'll go to the theater more and buy more concessions.

MoviePass didn't need free tickets to be profitable. They needed tickets discounted enough that the subscription fee for people who didn't see a movie each month plus the money from selling the data came out to more than the cost of the tickets for the people who did use it.

Regal doesn't need it to be more expensive than a single ticket either. They've decided to make it more expensive because they think that will be the most profitable, but they certainly don't need it to be - if it were less than the price of a single ticket, but it caused you to go to the movies when you would otherwise not have gone (or to go twice when you would otherwise have gone once), and you buy essentially *any* concessions, then they made more money.

The fundamental reason MoviePass was unsustainable is not because the price was too low, but because there's just no reason for theaters to allow a middleman like that. MoviePass thought it was GrubHub, but this isn't a scenario like takeout where having a centralized middleman organizing things is useful. Most people just go to one or two theaters, and in a lot of the US if there are multiple theaters in a city, they're all owned by the same company. It isn't that the price was too low, it's that there's just no reason for the theaters to give a discount to MoviePass instead of just making their own MoviePass, which is exactly what's happening.",1562042589,{'gid_1': 1},esjuw5b,False,t3_c80yte,False,True,t1_esjojia,/r/movies/comments/c80yte/regal_cinemas_unlimited_ticket_subscription/esjuw5b/,1562042591.0,42,True,,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,1562352932.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

They kind of skirt around the issue here. The issue likely isn't the genre itself, or even the ""traditional conventions"" that they mention, guaranteed it has more to do with the fact that people just don't go to the movie theater as much anymore. When they do go to the theater they are only consistently showing up for kids movies and the big action spectacles like comic book movies and action movies. Romantic comedies and comedies in general have been struggling at the box office because people are just waiting to watch those kinds of films at home instead.

[],Sir_Derpysquidz,,,[],,,,text,t2_h66v3,False,,"Eh, it's been a give and take. The freedom of information act and the proliferation of mobile devices (either the bystander filming on a phone or a cop with a body cam) has given us the opportunity to hold law enforcement accountable like never before. That said, it's not being used to it's full extent everywhere.

On the flip side, things like the Patriot act, and the development of Big Data/ the NSA means that we're far more monitored than we were previously. 

A few decades ago the local cops could shakedown a few teens without cause on the weekend, if they found anything fun it out and tell them to go the fuck home or they'll throw their ass in jail for the night.  Those same kids could also just walk into their local grocery store, grab for a 12 pack, say it's for for Grandpa and walk right out with it and generally have no questions asked. 

Both of those instances would have dire consequences in the modern day. The former would be filmed, shared, and the cops come under scrutiny for ignoring due process (and rightfully so). The kids at best would be told no these days and at worst have the cops called nowadays if they pushed the issue. 


A small (albeit anecdotal) example:
I worked at a grocery store this past semester and I had an old guy come in to buy some cigarettes. I'm talking about a guy who has has been smoking probably twice as long as I've been alive (21 years) and when I asked for his ID (I have to scan it to continue the sale), he said he didn't have it on him, and I told him I couldn't sell to him. He told me to ""get [Manager's name] he knows what to do"". Rather than fight with an old man for minimum wage over cigarettes I called my manager to the register and low and behold he overrided the lock, manually entered the birthday the guy told us, and completed the sale. The next day I came in to work we suddenly had mandatory tobacco sales retraining. Apparently, corporate saw the overridden sale, had someone check cams footage of that exact register, and then called and chewed my Manager's ass out over it within 24 hours of the sale. 

That did not, and could not even remotely happen 30 years ago. Law enforcement is more tied down now that before, yes. Likewise, due to technology law enforcement didn't necessarily have to do *anything* to enforce it's laws. It's a give and take.",1560554173,{},er6q9kp,False,t3_c0nkqt,False,True,t1_er6mmam,/r/movies/comments/c0nkqt/oca_selective_timeline_of_famous_dystopias/er6q9kp/,1560554174.0,2,True,,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,1560818844.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

* I found myself feeling like I was figuring out the situation much more quickly than the characters as they were discovering the anomalies of the shimmer world. By the 3rd or 4th time Lena came across some strange biological mutation, I was utterly bored. Yes, we get it. This is so BIZARRE and OUTLANDISH, but haven't you figured out what the hell is going on yet by now?? Why are you still surprised? And why are they all so utterly shocked to find out that many of the members of the older team died in there? Again, they NEVER RETURNED, and you all knew that. What did you expect had happened to them? They kept saying over and over ""The first team were either killed by something in here, or they went crazy and killed each other."" And yet it's an absolute SHOCK once they start finding evidence that they died...?

Yeah, the 'look at this omg' was kinda stretched-out and repetitive. Though for the characters, rather than the audience, it does make sense. You get used to the idea of the place being bizarre and outlandish, but how could one not react and marvel at its every increasingly more obvious instance. To what extent we, as an audience, should be shown all of that, is a matter for debate. But on the older teams dying I'd only say that, yeah, they knew that, but witnessing it and experiencing all of that and fearing that they might end up in the same situations is an entirely different beast. 

* The way this corporation, or government entity, or whatever it is, was going about trying to figure out the shimmer world seems entirely unrealistic to me. If you've already sent full teams in and they never returned while trying to reach the lighthouse, why would you KEEP sending more teams in with the exact same objective? I'm pretty sure they'd stop sending anyone in at all. Or start by sending a team just 5% of the way in, gathering data, then calling them back, and slowly figuring out more information in pieces. Lena collects more than enough DNA and other evidence within the first **minute** of them being in the shimmer. Why not return and analyze it at that point?

Yeah, shit's not explained at all. What I got out of it though was that the had mostly sent out soldiers previously; the girl-power team were the first scientists to go through. It was clear that no one had any idea what they were faced with and, with the prospect of Earth eventually being swallowed up by the Shimmer, the only thing they had left was try and try again. Ventress did mention that it was essential to reach the lighthouse, as the data they collected in the first day or two would only show how much more they didn't know as opposed to provide answers (though her reasons to reach the lighthouse were more dubious and it was made clear she didn't intend to go back)  


* Dr. Ventress' character is utterly laughable. She makes statements throughout that no real psychologist would ever say, and certainly not one who's qualified to be running this kind of operation. Such as ""I think you're confusing suicide with self-destruction."" As if suicide is an admirable act? And ""You can't have a lawyer"" made me laugh. So cliche. Again, chances are the government or a major corporation would not conduct an operation this way. Lena didn't choose to enter into this, you forced her, and now you're demanding she cooperate without answering questions, detaining her without cause, and no lawyer. It just seems very dramatic, unrealistic, and cliche compared to a movie like 'Arrival' that did it so much better.

Again, agreed. Though I didn't take that statement to mean that suicide is admirable in any way. Rather, focusing on the nuance of self-destruction, especially since this was such an on-the-nose theme of the movie (literally every member of that team was engaging in this in some form).

* Ventress says early on that the shimmer will expand and engulf cities, then states, then countries, etc. Basically the world will be annihilated and that's why nothing matters now unless we find out the truth. That's quite a leap, one that a real scientist in that position would not make. Yes, they've observed that it's expanded for 2 years, but to a still relatively small area. They have no information at all that would tell them conclusively that it would engulf the entire planet (in a scientific sense). This is just thrown in there as exposition so that we get the point that ""the whole world is doomed."" Her character motivation (cancer) is thrown in as an afterthought when the scientist in the hazmat suit later on is criticizing Lena for following her decisions...?? Again, we find this out now once they're already 3/4 of the way to the lighthouse, not early on so that I'm more invested in the character's motives.

The ol' 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.' The only thing they knew is that shit had been expanding, ostensibly killing any human it touched, and didn't understand anything about it. I'd say that the possibility of the Shimmer eventually eating up the Earth isn't so far-fetched - and even if it were contained to a few cities, it would still be a big deal. 

* The DRAMATIC memory loss the team experiences the first few days is never revisited again. Literally. Never. Think about it, they lose their memory so drastically that they don't even remember setting up camp or being there for 3-4 days already. But for the rest of the movie that never interferes with them again. They setup camp each night, wake up and move on again, remembering exactly where they're headed and what they're doing. No explanation is given for this; either why it happened just the initial time and never again, or if it's actually happening the whole time and they just stop noticing.

Yup, was bothered by this too. I could surmise some possibilities, but truth is they should have explained this/dropped it from the movie/or play it up somehow.",1560298619,{},eqt09wg,False,t3_aw01b3,False,True,t1_eqt0919,/r/movies/comments/aw01b3/everything_i_felt_was_wrong_with_annihilation/eqt09wg/,1560298620.0,1,True,,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,1560404574.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

------------------
**Disclaimer**: I am nowhere related to movie business but love to watch them, like everyone else. Also, English is my second language and i have never written long essays/proposals so apologies on that. 

I have loved T1 and T2 ever since i watched them (I was a kid so have watched them multiple times as i grew up). Unfortunately, none of the follow ups to T2 ever reached the awesomeness of original 2. For me T:Salvation was the closest follow up to original but we all know how it got ruined. 

Here is what I think what could have been a good follow up to Terminator franchise. 

-----------------------------------
**Terminator 3**

The movie will have 3 main arcs

* John. This is obvious. But this time john isn’t running away or hiding from terminators but he is actually preparing himself to fight them. 

* Secret Weapon Industries (or we can choose any better name). Let’s call them WX for rest of the write up. This is a secret organization sponsored by government to build futuristic weapons. Their only focus is to build weapons which can be controlled from control rooms, hence making any army for US which will reduce soldiers casualties. US has learned in the past that sending soldiers to real war zone will only get more backlash from it’s nation hence they are focused on building such weapons. 

* The AI organization. Let’s call it AX for rest of the write up. This organization is just specializing in AI. With no connection to weapons/war or whatsoever. The IT people working in this organization are passionate towards building an AI which can learn by itself. Scientists working in this org are passionate towards their specific fields ranging from decoding human genomes and fixing cancer/aids etc to scientists who are making comprehensive visual models to detect threats from satellite imagery.

**ACT 1:**

The movie picks up after some years of T2 events. John has been hiding from secret agencies and trying to find out a way where he can prepare himself for future. He knows that T2 events may have changed the timeline, but judgement day is inevitable and he wants to prepare himself for it. He can’t get into security forces for training because this will put him in a place where he will be answerable to so many officials. So he decided to go back to the family who provided T800 weapons in T2 (can’t recall the name of that group and how they were related). His main goal is to learn/understand weapons and build a trust with group of people who he can then lead towards his rebellion against machines. He is mentally prepared for it now.

Meanwhile, the security agencies learns that there had been some metal piece which was discovered from the industry where T2 was ended. This was a surprise for them since they thought everything would have been destroyed in the molten iron. This attracts the WX organization to learn more about this material and possible build a weapon which will be indestructible. The piece of metal which is found here was a mixture of T800 metal and T1000 mercury. This piece had some chip inside which was “mostly” destroyed. 

When WX team starts to study this metal, the realize there is a chip inside so they call AX team to see if they can get any info out of it. The chip is destroyed so the AX team isn’t that hopeful but they kept trying to reverse engineer it. 

**The ACT 1 finishes on 3 stories**

* John building his experience on weapons and earning the reputation of expert of any sort of weaponry. 

* WX just discovered this indestructible material and they have started to reverse engineer it. Keep in mind that this material is the mixer of T800 and T1000 left over. So this new weapon would already be ahead of T1000 that we saw in T2. 

* AX is trying to get data out of that destroyed chip. They aren’t hopeful but they are working. Meanwhile, AX warfare team is building algos to learn what threats are and how to detect them before they are lethal

**ACT 2**

WX team has been able to reverse engineer the metal and they are able to build a new material. They decided to build human-like robot which is controlled by a human sitting in the control room. However, they aren’t sure how agile and how lethal this robot is. So they reach out to John and hire/invite him to their facility where they offer him to test some of their weapons. 

WX team doesn’t have much trust in John and for them this new project, let’s call it W100, is super secret. So they ask john to test their some low-profile weapons. With every test, John proves himself to be a genius of his field. Finally WX team decides to bring john to test W100. 

The events from T2 flashes in-front of John when john sees W100 for the first time. It’s the exact robot that has saved his mother and him from T1000. The only difference was that it didn’t have human skin/flesh and it didn’t have an AI. John is terrified but he kept his composure and he agrees to test this weapon for WX. In the testing exercise, john defeat W100 and WX thank him. WX team goes back to drawing board to improve their W100 and john goes back to his group. 

John’s is puzzled and frightened. He thought that judgment day would be few years down the road but he already saw step 1 towards it. He wants to stop it right here. He doesn’t want WX team to do any other testing on this. But he is in no position to suggest them to do so. So he decides to blow up the whole facility with the help of his friends. He builds up a squad to attack WX. 

John is a weapon expert but not a strategist, yet. Even though he had a lot of big weapons, he didn’t has any strategy. His plan was to just blow up the compound. He didn’t account for the security that compound would have and if he has any back up plan. As expected, his plan fails miserable with heavy casualties in his group. He retreats and fled to country X.

WX Team is shocked that someone attacked them. They put blame on country X and higher officials start to discuss their plan how to counter attack that country. None of them think about john. 

Meanwhile, AX team is able to recover some scrambled data from the chip. Keep in mind that chip is coming from T800. Which was previously programmed to kill sarah connor and then to save john connor. The data which is retrieved from the chip is all over the place and the only meaninful info AX team was able to retrieve was that “connor rebelled and needs to be killed to save the humanity”. 

AX shares this info with WX team only on one condition. That they will use W200 (next iteration on W100) to destroy John’s Connor group. But they will put the warfare AI in that machine. WX is little hesitant to do so but AX team assures them that this AI is “targeted” AI and wouldn’t go beyond John Connor. This will give AX/WX teams to test their master pieces. 

**ACT 2 finishes on 3 main stories**

* John’s heavy loss when he attacked WX. He learned that he has to plan better in future attacks

* WX learning from AX team that it was connor (John) behind all this

* AX team convincing WX team to use next iteration of W100 with their warfare AI to attack John

**ACT 3**

Now this is final act and it doesn’t have much of build up. The main plot point of this act would be

* John fights against bunch of W200 sent to kill him. John would be able to come out as winner because of his weapon expertise and he is learning to strategize. This will build his trust among people/army of country he was hiding in who saw machines attacking them and they will start to see john as their leader. 

* AI which is installed in W200 is finally connected to the mainframe and it realized that how dangerous john is. The AX team loses their control over W200 robots and they ask their army to destroy them but W200 learned it before they could attack and they destroy the AI labs. So now these machines aren’t being controlled by them. AI’s current target is connor (john) and it is designed to learn to defeat it’s target. It started to learn from mainframe data all the secret/weapons etc which is available and may be utilized to kill john. 

* The final showdown would be where machine realizes that killing john’s isn’t easy as long as John is supported by other people (including some armies). So machine decided to launch full-fledged attack on those countries only to weaken John. The machines, as of now are not worried about bringing peace to the world. It is targeted, towards destroying john. At any cost and that’s how this version of T3 will end. Leaving room to pick up in T4.


-----------

I personally think that T3 should have focused on building up John's character and how he reached that point and also exploring the evolution of John' and why they are after John.

* How a car's brakes can be disabled via onStar, or a steering wheel can be offset suddenly 25 degrees to the right forcing it to ""Correct"" and the cars front wheels will move to the left (into oncoming traffic) with no interaction from the driver. Same can be done with the throttle by disabling the pedal input and manipulating cruise control speed. Most cars were effected for a long time. This was a way to hack the CAN-bus in a car.

There are wifi enabled cars right now, that give even easier access to the CAN-bus with the downside that you simply can't call the onstar number from anywhere but would have to be within about 1.2-0.5 miles to exploit them and cause a car crash at high speeds.

It should be noted that since inspection of the ram of car systems is not standard procedure, and you have about 8 minutes to do so anyway, and since these types of hacks and manipulations live only there in the live systems, this is done without lasting evidence.

* Warrantless access to any Intel based CPU via the VISA exploit (NSA) There are other NSA created issues that have run afoul of the security world, namely [Wannacryptor](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/12/nsa-hacking-tools-hospital-ransomware-attacks-wannacryptor-238328)

Or your mum, or hell anyone's cell phone. Want to do that? You can! it's call the SS7 exploit, and it's been used for decades by police, PI, hackers, FBI, etc. Can't get that nasty warrant for someone's location, this unpatched and well known hole will let you track anyone by just knowing the cell phone number.

What kind of backwards logic is it that you're in favor of deregulating ISPs because you want to regulate tech companies.

1 MB of data is 1 MB of data. That's why it's in the form of a universal measurement.

Another way of putting it is that it costs significantly more for Vimeo or other smaller tech firms to service another 100,000 customers than it is for Google since Google or Netflix are guaranteed a good deal on their rates like you said.

I’m really not. You can’t have ISP regulation without edge providers regulation, otherwise you favor the unregulated over the regulated. So ISPs would have to allow peering across the board, but the actual information that is “neutrally” transmitted would actually be censored information from Google. That’s why it’s all or nothing. You can’t say regulate ISPs now, and **maybe** Big Tech later.

&gt; Net neutrality guarantees that 1MB of data for one firm has the same speed and access as any other firm.

That’s impossible because the protocols of the Internet would never allow 1MB of data to be treated equally.

&gt; Taking away net neutrality would make video streaming prohibitively expensive for smaller firms like Vimeo who would have to negotiate rates bilaterally with every ISP.

Vimeo isn’t as big as YouTube, therefore their bandwidth usage is lower, as is their peering costs. That’s beneficial to smaller Internet companies, not detrimental.

There is plenty he could do with that theme too. We are left with David playing around with embryos, black goo, and his host, Daniels. We haven't seen a xeno King, and we haven't seen a xeno born from a queen, whom becomes iconic to the franchise.

This is David's arc, and his theme is directly related to creation. We could find out that he has finalised his perfect creation using the goo.

&gt; So if I watched a blu-ray enough times to actually make it degrade

The degradation is inherent on the materials used, is not much dependant on how many time you read it (as opposite on what happens for the e.g. vinyls). Also those lifespan are often considered under ideal condition.

Usually the digital code present in the BR allows you to download the whole movie, watch it on streaming on a dedicated portal, or both. If you want to be sure to be able to watch the movie even if the company who offer the service goes bankrupt, you have to download it on a private medium.

The problem of having a digital copy of each media is a tricky one. In the case of BR we are talking about ~25-50Gb of stuff for each film. You can store it on a dedicated HD, which is also susceptible to degradation. The default solution is store the same data on multiple HDs, but it is expansive and inconvenient. 

The solution many people resort is to store everything on the cloud (e.g. google play music). However, given the high amount of space required you most likely need to rent the space or use dedicated services  (e.g. Steam for games). From there to using services as Netflix, which doesn't even guarantee that you can see now the movie that was on its list a month ago, it's not that big leap.

Basically, the rapid increase of pixel density in the monitors and TV pushed an higher increased of definition required from the movies and games, which in return increased the space required at faster pace of the grow of the space available on current HDs (tech which also recently pivoted the focus from increasing the space available to increasing the access speed with SSD).

So all things considered, the shift from media-as-a-good to media-as-a-service is understandable and quite inevitable.

You are really bad at reading people. I'm Canadian...I hate pretty much everything conservative...especially your GOP and Trump. I don't see how calling the theater experience shit makes me a right-winger as I'm as liberal as it gets. That doesn't mean I'm blind to people having poor priorities and making bad life choices. Is it a leftist attribute in your country to not waste your money on dumb shit? Shitty live choices are made everyday by all kinds of people.

&gt;You better work on your communication skills. You have personally attacked me and insulted me. I do not accept your apology because it's clear you have no idea what you're apologizing for.

Calling you out on your bullshit is a personal attack now? Yet here you are calling me an elistist, genius, right-winger? Buddy, you're a joke.

&gt;Yeah, you go write that and let us all know how it goes. Clearly the whole world is waiting for you to tell them how to get the best screen experience.

The more you talk the more ignorant you sound. Like you have nothing to contribute to anything. 

&gt;I didn't say that it's cost-prohibitive for me. I said it's cost-prohibitive for other people, which is true. This is not about me. Stop trying to make it personal.

Your entire lame argument is based on the idea that nothing beats the real cinema experience..like that to you is objectively the best option. But then you go on this virtue signalling about the plight of the poor and how they could never afford a TV to watch films at home....WTF? You think someone that can't afford a bloody HD TV, which is dirt cheap now and less that the cost of going to the cinema every week of the year. You're struggling to find any bit to stand on as you have nothing.

You keep championing the cinema experience as the better value when anyone with half a brain will tell you it's over priced as fuck to go to the theater. Nothing you are saying makes any sense. If you can afford to go 52 weeks a year a home setup is a drop in the bucket, the point that is clearly going over your head.

&gt;This is starting to get disturbing. This is just Reddit, dude. We don't know each other and we never will. We're not talking about you and me. We're talking about home-viewing vs. theatrical and why theatrical still matters. Your preference is not an objective reality. It is only your preference.

If you can't wrap your head around the most basic of ideas such as food being objectively better when made in your home vs the heat lamp shit at the theater...I don't even know why you engage in any debate on reddit or otherwise. You do know what I mean when I say objectively better, right? Should we dumb it down a shade? Eating a well prepared snack in your home is objectively better than eating shit, is it not?

Theatrical only matters due to selection and availabilty...it's has zero to do with the experience being better. Most of the world wouldn't be bothered to put up with that shit if we could stream everything in our homes on opening day. You think parents like having to get a sitter to catch that blockbuster? If so you obviously never had kids. 

You know, context is everything and when you attempt to pull bits and pieces out to make yourself look good it's just sad and pathetic. I mean no one is reading this debate we're having but us. Yet you feel the need to be a prick with this little bit:

&gt;&gt;I fail to understand...

""Yeah, I know.""

When I really said:
 ""I fail to understand why anyone wouldn't think having 100% control of the volume, picture and playback of a movie to be objectively better than the alternative.""

If you quoted the entire statement and didn't act like a child this conversation might be interesting...but I assure you it is not. Why is it that you can't see that statement as being true. If you could just explain yourself instead of simply taking shots things wouldn't devolve into this shit.

&gt;Once again, this is not about me. For the last time, stop trying to make this personal.

Nobody cares about your situation, you are correct. I'm using the data you put forth to make the point as clear as day but you can't seem to understand it. If **an individual** can afford to go to the theater 52 times a year they can afford more than the average home cinema setup. No one using public transport can afford to do what you claim you are doing.

&gt;If you think the New York Times of all places produces fluff PR pieces, then you're clearly misinformed on what they are. And I'm not surprised at all you that you dismissed it so easily, as you seem to do with anything that goes against your opinion.

Your reading comprehension is lacking if you think an article filled with hearsay and secondary opinions should be take as fact. There is no concrete data in there....and reads like ""unknown friends of Spielberg don't think he feels that way"" That's your big reveal? It's so vague skirting the real issue, Spielberg clearly doesn't want streaming to be legitimized with any parity recognition when it comes to the Oscars. 

&gt;Yeah, you know Netflix buying theaters is illegal right? They bought that one theater, but that was not them getting into the theater business. Do some research.

Holy shit you can't be that dense..Why is that illegal exactly?..They purchased it so they could fight the academy/Spielberg and show their films in a theater and not be disqualified from the awards. That's the whole reason for it. No one wants to be in the theater business as it's absolute garbage for those operating those screens. You thought they wanted to own a chain? Lol. That would be like Netflix opening a new Blockbuster. Remember what happened with that? Within our lifetime the same thing will happen with theaters.

&gt;hat has been my point the entire time, yet for some reason you seem to engage in personal attacks and approach it with some sort of weird political agenda. This has been a worthless conversation and you have my pity. Take care.

Here's some advice....next debate you have in cyberspace refrain from virtue signaling and just stick to the facts. If you present facts don't be surprised if they are then used against you. Don't claim you don't care about something then write a thousand word response clearly demonstrating the opposite. And don't bring politics into a debate that had none to begin with. I don't agree with you so I must be right-wing? Like I said, I'm Canadian. I love my socialized universal health care and I'm happy to pay my taxes so my neighbor doesn't have to lose his house should he become ill. Gay marriage, equal rights for all...you name it, I'm for it. I just don't like spending $50 on a movie I've been dying to see all year and have it ruined by a handful of inconsiderate patrons.

Maybe it's different where you are but since out little talks I've been speaking to a lot of people at my work about what they prefer....all of them (young and old) would much rather be home on the couch than deal with the theater experience.

[],ragingsimian,,,[],,,,text,t2_i7sib,False,,"The Ballad of the Timestone  ... the story of Old Man Cap

&amp;#x200B;

There is now a quantum reality without Thanos' big scary army playing footsie with other big scary armies in the chase for the stones. A reality that soon won't thate EVENTUALLY won't have stones to protect it from really big scary things like extra-dimensional invasions and idiots playing with quantum energies and time.

And there is the small issue of how they found Thanos by sensors throughout the Galaxy looking for him. Those sensors didn't go away. In fact there are now more people likely with sensor data showing that really really big signatures of stone activity lit up on Earth. ""Thanks Earth for bringing back us evil people but we'll be taking those stones from you now""

&amp;#x200B;

No chance the surviving big brains and earth's most powerful mass armies (magicians, wakandans, asgardians) who actually knew what really happened versus some creative lies would simply shake hands and walk away from a place that had all six stones and is currently a pile fo rubble. The Avengers are going to tell them what's up and the armies aren't going to disband. 

&amp;#x200B;

They would have to fortify and set themselves up as best they can for what comes next before keeping the promise to give back the stones. How long that took is irrelevant ... cuz quantum ... and they already knew that bit. I don't remember if Hulk's arm was still in a sling. That Gamma damage might be permanent ... cuz gamma ...

If Hulk's arm is permanent or very slow to heal then who knows how long it's been. Weeks? Months? Years? How much they had to go through to build up confidence that they were ready to give back the stones?

They now know that time travel is possible but did the plans and necessary pre-cursor tech survive? How long to get all the parts and rebuild?

&amp;#x200B;

The plot holes everyone says is wrong with the movie for putting the stones back. I'm sure they would notice that too. Like the casings for all of the stones being broken. There is one stone who's casing was never broken. The time stone. Thanos rewinded time for one of the stones being shattered. They could have run tests and crossed fingers that an extra copy of the time stone they bring with them can re-construct a broken casing as long it is in the quantum reality that had the casing before they took it.

&amp;#x200B;

Captain Marvel would have shot out to scout and the Asgardians of the Galaxy would be roaming around with more purpose than just finding a lost girlfriend. And they brought a party loving heavy hitter ... Thor bro' with his lightning axe. And I'm sure Rocket pocketed a few toys like Stark's and Shuri's nanotechs weaponry.

&amp;#x200B;

The Universe's biggest boy scout just walked away with the six stones knowing that their defenses won't hold.  He know's they can't keep rolling the dice and hoping for 1 in 14 million wins. Sooner or later a cosmos level bad dude with planet leveling firepower is going to break through trying to find the stones and not be happy when he gets told the Earthlings gave them away. But oh by the way ... they have a time machine soooo ... let's go do what they did and steal them.

&amp;#x200B;

Before heading back to the platform to likely die in hail of glory with all of his friends Old Man Cap spins off a timeline where he get's married while also being part of hydra, shield and likely other roles. With a legacy of super soldier offspring as well in the background.

&amp;#x200B;

Just like we don't notice (or have) the X-men and Fantastic Four the original Iron Man reality doesn't have family america working the backgrounds of earth and space with one singular goal in mind. Having a post-snap defense force. A 1970's Old Man Cap knows there are worlds beyond earth. He has time to get himself or his offspring out there for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

What we see at the end of Avengers Endgame is Old Man Cap. Handing off the shield to a new generation he helped build in the background with the hope they'll make it farther than he knows his reality will go.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's when old man cap reaches into his pocket and goes back to the platform.

I enjoyed it, but there's just a lot of stuff that bothered me:

&amp;nbsp;

Tried to put it in somewhat of chronological order


-“We have no way to detect Thanos he just walked through a portal and disappeared.” A second later Rocket pushes some buttons and detects Thanos, after Nebula just gave some irrelevant information on how he called his retirement home “the garden.”

&amp;nbsp; 

-Tony Stark just invents time travel in mere hours. I get he’s a genius but come on. I tried to justify this by assuming he got all the Pym particle and Quantum Realm data from Lang, and used that new information to solve it. But thats just an assumption because the movie wants you to believe he just figured it out after thinking about it for a few hours and running some simulations. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Professor Hulk….. He just made me uncomfortable. 

&amp;nbsp;

-The bad product placement and unsubtle woman empowerment stuff. The “don’t worry, she’s got help” scene was just way too in your face cringe. 

&amp;nbsp;

-What the fuck did they do with Thor? I can understand how much he’s been through and the reasoning for his fallout; but suddenly he just sucks in battle and is super weak? I loved the fat rock bottom Thor at first, it was a good gag, but I kept waiting for him to do a zap of lightning or something and be buff again, especially after he talked to his mom and got his mind right. He’s supposed to be a god no? 

&amp;nbsp;

-I love how Cap was worthy of wielding Mjolnir and Thor’s “I knew it!” Still couldn’t get past the fact that Cap is all of a sudden supposedly stronger than Thor. I guess Thor’s powers are connected to his mental state or something seeing as suddenly he could barely fight Thanos with Storm-breaker AND Mjolnir, after he took on a full gauntlet Thanos in Infinity War. 

&amp;nbsp;

-No one calling Captain Marvel when they figure out time travel and are about to attempt to save the universe. I get she’s supposed to be busy helping out other worlds, but unless her interstellar pager is on do-not-disturb mode you think she would respond to such a call. 

&amp;nbsp;

-How did Thanos time travel in his ship? Everyone else needs special suits that are designed to use the Pym particle. How did they use the special wrist band and little vial of particles to send a fucking space ship through time? And how did his army suddenly get there? 

&amp;nbsp;

-No chance regular humans like Hawkeye survived that bombing of Avengers headquarters.

&amp;nbsp;

-Speaking of the bombing on the HQ, when Hulk is holding up the building, a scene shows Ant-Man running towards Rhodey, Rocket and Banner who are about to drown. The scene ends with someone saying something like “see you on the other side,” and the water is just about to cover their face. Next, a huge fight scene happens for 10 plus minutes, until they do the hero introductions and Ant-Man grows holding the three of them. So presumably it took Ant-Man that long to reach them, and they’ve all somehow not drowned. Was Dr. Strange supposed to be stopping the water from drowning them?

&amp;nbsp;

-Wasting screen-time with re-used scenes from older movies. They showed way too much of Quills dance in the Power Stone temple for example. Also the shot from the original Avengers where the chitauri are on the side of the building and the heroic pan of all the heroes. I’d prefer these 20 second scenes used to show present day Quill in the big fight or more scenes involving heroes in the big battle.  

&amp;nbsp;

-Everyone fighting Thanos one at a time until the next hero comes in at the most opportune dramatic timing.

&amp;nbsp;

-Captain Marvel showing up was cool, but couldn’t Thor, Tony, (or god forbid Hulk actually doing something) have taken down the ship?

&amp;nbsp;

-Captain Marvel should’ve been able to immediately whoop no-gauntlet Thanos’ ass.

&amp;nbsp;

-Thanos headbutts her hard and it makes a comedic thud sound and she doesn’t even flinch. Nothing on her skin even moved like she was hardcoded in the matrix and the laws of physics don’t apply. But yet she is still having a hard time fighting him. 

&amp;nbsp;

-The fact that Captain Marvel didn’t put on the gauntlet and instead opted to carry it around. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Speaking of which, I wanted more of Spidey and Strange doing cool stuff. Instead he’s preoccupied with some water for the whole fight. Strange should’ve been incredibly vital in that battle, and Spidey is just Spidey, except apparently he’s just a guy with webs while the suit does everything and he has to get saved by other people. 

&amp;nbsp;

-I guess Pepper fights in a Iron-Man suit now with zero explanation given? Like there weren’t enough characters to involve already. All they had to do to explain this is say she trained for it after the snap to help protect their daughter or something. Without explanation it irks me she was taking up screen time in the epic battle from other heroes. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Are we supposed to assume that Tony’s suit took almost all of the hit from the snap? Otherwise there’s no way he wouldn’t have disintegrated instantly. When did Tony figure out how to harness the 6 powers of the Universe with his Iron-Man suit?

[],MisterBadIdea2,,,[],,,,text,t2_d36sz,False,,"* Okay, so how the fuck is society still standing after five years? The movie treats the half-extinction of Earth as like, a bigger 9/11. Maybe five to ten 9/11s, in impact. No no no, horseshit, we are living in the Mad Max-iverse if that had happened, so the entire time my only question was how the hell they managed to keep the lights on. Make a movie for the heroes that pulled *that* off.

* They also say specifically that 50% of *all living beings* died, so like, did people wake up with half their lawns missing? Are half the national parks just dust? Who's running agriculture? No one who wrote this has any clue what it means that LITERALLY HALF OF EVERYTHING DIED. Maybe Thanos didn't do this evenly and only like 1% of Earth died and 99% of some other poor planet got erased

* Captain Marvel was hilariously nowhere near the ace in the hole that Nick Fury thought she was

* Also hilarious: Either Natalie Portman just plain has no interest in being in these movies anymore, or Marvel just has no interest in her, still funny either way. We don't even find out if she survived the snap

* I do appreciate that Thor's big emotional scene was with his mother, even though his father, his brother or Natalie Portman would have made more sense, being more substantial characters. They probably cost more though. Plus I always got the feeling that there was more substance to Thor's mom and I'm glad she finally got a good acting scene, Rene Russo is a good actress

* So, uh, contract negotiations with Scarlett Johansson didn't go well, I take it? Shame, I liked her, even though she basically had to play a different character in every movie. Was looking forward to her finally getting her own film.

* Black Widow dying was the only death I didn't see coming and the only thing I'd have been upset to have been spoiled on. I mean, we all thought Hawkeye was gonna bite it, right? Because who gives a shit about Hawkeye?

* It'd be funny if after she kills herself Hawkeye still doesn't get the Soul Stone:
Red Skull: You must sacrifice someone you love.
Hawkeye: I did love her!
Red Skull: You guys hooked up *once.* Geez, you mortals, always overdramatizing things.

* Both Tony and Cap got the endings they deserved and the endings they wanted. Say what you will about the MCU, the writing of those two characters has been extremely consistent and has been building to this specifically.

* Geez, you think disappearing half the population would be disruptive to society, how about dropping them back into society?? And with half the population five years older while they haven't aged???? My god. Disaster.

* I said this at the end of the last Avengers movie and I'll say it again: I don't see how the next Spider-Man movie isn't just Peter staring blankly into space while his dumbass friend yaks on about prom or shit

* This whole Endgame thing should be brain-breakingly disruptive to Spider-Man, but I know it won't be, they'll just pretend like it didn't happen and no one will mention it. But it looks like this actually is going to be super-disruptive to Guardians. Are they supposed to go around having adventures with alt-timeline no-character-development Gamora? Like at the end of Star Trek: Nemesis where they have reboot Data instead of real Data? The fuck is this shit, I don't want this. I kinda suspect there's going to be a REAL reset to all this Infinity War stuff in Guardians 3

* It kind of feels like superhero movies should end after this, even though I know they won't.

It's not about being woke, it's about certain decisions being made for artistic and commercial purposes. 

&gt; What? If you go to a Disney store or park, they have merch for every film they've made that I can think of other than Song of the South. So now are they just going to have 50% of Little Mermaid stuff have one Ariel and 50% have the other?

So does your head explode every time Disney make a live action adaptation? Can you not tell the difference between a live action person and a cartoon? How about the fact that there'll be much, much more merchandise produced for the live action Little Mermaid that'll be primarily marketed towards a child audience for whom the new Ariel will be their first experience of the character? Or failing all that, how about the fact that this is Disney we're talking about and they know what they're doing when it comes to merch and marketing. The billions upon billions of dollars they make every year is testament to that. They've sold identical looking Toy Story action figures since 1995, so I think that marketing toys for related movies that are 30 odd years apart in terms of release dates will be no problem. 

Your confusion is baffling in how simple-minded it is. I make cartoons for a living and can assure you that kids  can readily accept that a superhero can appear in various forms over various media, or that a character from their parent's childhood can be rebooted or updated years later. 
Your whole argument is rooted in the fact that **you** handle the fact that the new Ariel will be black. 

&gt; To me, the merch point is like if they changed Optimus Prime from a truck to a train. A kid might ask for an Optimus Prime toy and then get the wrong one.

I think there's an infamous Reddit post about you. Is your name Kevin? Seriously, if every truck Optimus Prime toy mysteriously vanished from the shelves and was replaced by the train version then your Transformers-based sleepless nights might have some credence. However, given the fact that the Optimus Prime we all know and love is over 30 years old, it's likely that you'd be unable to find a truck Optimus Prime.

Skyrim was just over the line for mediocre. We hadn't had an Elder Scrolls game in quite a number of years and everyone was all excited for it.

Unfortunately the game starts to fall apart after the first run through it, possibly even before then.

1. Thieves Guild Quest line is a total joke. You can invest literally nothing in to stealth or thievery, just be a heavy plate armor wearing thug with a beat-stick and murder your way through every stage of the quest.
2. Mages Guild questline is an even worse joke. I think you are required to cast MAYBE three spells total, all low level shit, the rest you can charge through again as just a dumb brute with a beat stick and somehow get made the Dean of the College or whatever. Bull. Shit.
3. Dialogue choices railroad you pretty hardcore. No, you aren't allowed to explain Paarthurnax to the blades, you can kill him or not, take it or leave it.
4. There is no variety in character builds. Since there is no level cap like in Fallout NV (and 3) eventually all characters you make will max out all skills and have all perks. It's all the same, every time.
5. Even the early game stuff where you are much more limited in active perks manages to be dumbed down. Oh you leveled up! Which color of bar do you want to increase? WIth the loss of stats and stat allocation from previous titles you can't make a low intelligence dumbdumb, nor a high intelligence weakling. It severely limits your ability have the character you roleplay reflected in the game proper. To compare, look at New Vegas's skill dialogue and stat based dialogue (Low INT runs anyone?)
6. All gear and spells are just linear upgrades that all handle the same. Swinging an obsidian axe is the same as swinging and iron axe, one just has bigger numbers. All the animations are the same and have the same frame data. Compare a game like dark souls where there is a much bigger variety in weapons and weapon handling (although each class of weapon does share a move set, outside certain unique weapons) yet all weapons are on a much more even power curve. With upgrades and enchantments you could totally beat the game with the broken sword you get at the start, or your starter weapon. Skyrim? Nah mate, after a certain point your numbers aren't big enough. Best you can do is stack armor and HP (plus the perks) until you are literally invincible and just sit there with your starter weapons taking half an hour to kill anything.  

7. The civil war questline is the biggest joke of the all. Watch as 7 soldiers on each side flail around at eachother trying to take a fort you already ran through and looted 12 hours ago.

Those are just the biggest problems the game has. Nevermind the bugs that still exist in the default unmodded game today.

The guy in the picture is General Shephard.  He's your CO.  In the mission this is from he's sent you to investigate a house in the wilderness, looking for a Bad Guy.  Bad Guy isn't there but a lot of his dudes and kit are.  You and your team decide to download all the data you can, destroy the kit, and get out.

Worth saying - the battle in which you defend this house while the download happens is pretty difficult.  But you succeed (obviously) - data downloaded, house wrecked, time to get out.  Your CO has arrived in a nearby field by heli along with a ton of reinforcements.  You have to run through a wood to get there - and it's *this* sequence that so many people are complaining about in this comments section.  You can't fight back, there's a ton of enemies behind you, all you can do is run and hope you don't die.

So.  You reach the clearing, cutscene starts.  CO takes the Data Storage Module with all the data you downloaded (the big box he's holding in the pic).  I think that exact moment is what the screenshot is from.  He makes a comment about tying up loose ends (where the post title is from) and kills you and the rest of your team.  As you lie dying his crew douse you and your team in petrol or something and set you on fire.  As you burn you hear a radio message from another of your friends telling you not to trust CO because SURPRISE!  He's really working with the Bad Guy.

What was *really* going on: CO was working with Bad Guy to do Bad Things.  CO has turned on Bad Guy and is cleaning house (not in a good way, in a bad way).  He sent you do Bad Guy's house to retrieve/destroy any traces of their cooperation, including killing Bad Guy if he happened to be there (which he wasn't).  You duly do this, and the data you downloaded is the last proof that CO is actually Bad-er Guy.

It's a store that tries to be competitive with steam by giving a bigger cut of sales to developers, which is a good thing, while shoveling out cash for exclusivity deals which is **not** a good thing.  

Just to give you an example: Now I have a steam library with Borderlands 1 through pre-quel and but I need a seperate store for the next game? No thanks!

And they haven't always been transparant about this either. Epic store retroactively made some games exclusives! Metro: Exodus was announced to launch on steam at release date.  
People pre-ordered the game on steam and suddenly epic swoops in with a big wad of cash and gives a big middle finger to everyone that did because ""lol, timed exclusivity!""

[],shotnine,,,[],,,,text,t2_m9xsjg0,False,,"How much do you like Disney? If you loved the Disney movies, play it for the nostalgia because they managed to keep most of the original voice actors.

The story definitely gets cheesy. Remember the first game came out like 20 years ago. The games commentary on the morality of meddling in the affairs of “worlds” and the extent of friendship and responsibilities thereof can really make you think and feel.  Then there’s the music, which only amplifies the experience.

If you want to play them, I would say wait until KHIII’s ReMind or whatever DLC comes out. It’s supposed to make the 3rd game a bit better, but for the rest of the series, play them in order and most of them in the final mix version or HD collection. The only exception is 358/2 days as I will explain later. Also play on the harder modes if you want the secret endings easier. The secret endings really built up hype.

I hate turn based and “real-time” games. The hack n slash gameplay is what keeps me going. The first games gameplay is okay, but it was released in a time where the camera wasn’t bound to the right stick. This is true for birth by sleep as well, as it was released on the single-stick PSP. They “fixed” this is in the HD collection, but it’s still a little finicky.  But back to the first game, play the final mix or HD collection especially because you can’t skip cutscenes otherwise. This is mostly a problem if you die. You have to watch certain cutscenes over and over if you are having a bad day. So make sure, again, HD collection or final mix. 

You also can only walk/run/jump in KHI and Chain of Memories for the most part of the game. I think dodge roll is also something, but I can’t remember if it’s in the original KHI.  You do get a nice little feature I don’t want to spoil after a certain point. 

The card system in chain of memories is kind of bleh, but the story still holds up IMO. It’s very dream like, but I am fascinated with dream like experiences.

2 adds drive forms. If you level the drive forms up, you can grab their abilities to enhance movement such as high jump, “quick run,” dodge roll (Final Mix/HD), double jump, and [feature same as KHI]. You’re limited to the ability of each form if you stay in the form, but they can make exploring more fun. It also included some non cartoon worlds which was cool. See pirates of the Caribbean and tron. They did not get Johnny Depp, but his face is pretty spot on.

The next game would be 358/2 days. If you appreciated the beginning of KHII and the story, actually play the DS game if you can. The gameplay is NOT my favorite in this one. It’s not as fluid feeling as the rest. But the turning of this game into cutscenes in the HD collection really takes away from the impact of the story if you liked what was going on with II’s characters and their story. If not? Just watch the cutscenes. They’re cheesy, too. They just dubbed over the Japanese in these games I believe, though they did add some cutscenes/journal-like voice acting in the HD collection.

Then there birth by sleep. This is by far my favorite game. It’s the darkest and most emotional of the games. It has the best music as well. It’s set 10 years before KHII, so it’s more interactive with the Renaissance Disney stuff that the first one was lacking (e.g. Snow White, Cinderella). Now KHI did have beauty and the beast, but birth by sleep adds more of the older worlds is what I’m getting at.

re:coded should be next. Technically coded came around after chain of memories, but it was on some mobile device I never played, so Re:coded came just before the next game and ties up more of the story to prep you for Dream drop distance. It’s set in a data world.

Dream drop distance. It’s pretty cool. It introduces flow-motion to make movement faster and cooler. This felt the most childish of the games, but it does set you up for 3. It also incorporates from Legacy.

Idk I didn’t fuck with unchained x.

0.2/2.8
Small prologue to KHIII. It’s cool. It’s the dark world. If you got 2.8, it includes DDD, so there’s that. It’s short and a cool experience, but you’re not missing out too much if you just read what happens, I feel. I enjoyed it because it set up 3’s gameplay/enemies a bit. I’m also in love with Willa Holland (the main character’s voice actor), so I had an incentive.

KHIII: wait till the DLC this fall. It was OK, to be honest. It felt kind of quick. It was awesome seeing all the new worlds, i.e. big hero 6, and Pixar worlds like Tangled and Toy Story. Oh and seeing Unreal Engine Pirates was also beautiful. But I’m hoping the DLC makes this better instead of just bringing mostly everyone together.

That’s my ramble, lmao.


Tl;dr play if you like Disney, appreciate cool storytelling, and can handle a few cheesy moments, but wait till III’s DLC comes out. Play final mix/HD for most. If you like II’s characters’ story, play the DS version of 358/2 days. Play birth by sleep for the best story.

[],BrainDeadUnit,,,[],,,,text,t2_dtpi1,False,,"A lot of games ported to the Switch look like total ass -- I say this as a Switch enthusiast.

The issue is, game publishers didn't give a shit about the Switch and shrugged, until Switch games started racking in a lot of money. All the sudden, all the publishers wanted to port the most successful games to the Switch. These games were already optimized for drastically different systems -- namely, big, roomy X86 systems.

A game has to be really well optimized to run well and look great on the Switch -- the Switch has relatively little RAM and its memory bandwidth is pretty slim -- you can't just have huge textures and dump data into the GPU every frame to make things look good. 

To make a good looking Switch game, you really need to be creative with your art assets and clever with technical implementations -- Nintendo's own games are a great example of this.

id Software had the right foresight on this, too -- id Tech engine has really emphasized that the major roadblock in computing is the ""Von Neumann Bottleneck"" -- it's easy to have a lot of RAM, it's a lot harder to get that data from RAM into the CPU/GPU (Exactly the Switch's major bottleneck). So the id Tech engine is always trying to have the right textures at the right time, which worked really well on the Switch. Fill in the rest with good lighting and particle effects, and you've got a good looking game even on the Switch's limited hardware.

But most game engines haven't invested into getting around this problem, they see this problem as a ""hard limitation"". Load up as much RAM as you can, and then limit your ""window"" into this RAM at any one time. So on Switch ports, what you end up with are games devoid of textures, extreme sacrifices in LoD at close distances, etc.

This isn't something you can port well to the Switch, and publishers haven't had to worry about this because PS4 has GDDR5 and the Xbox One 68gb/s memory bandwidth and ESRAM. The Switch has *25gb/s* memory bandwidth, and that's it.

So yeah, unless a game has treated the Switch as first-class in its development alongside XBO and PS4, the game's probably going to look shit.",1567614423,{},eyzc7vw,False,t3_czlacy,False,True,t1_eyz50oc,/r/gaming/comments/czlacy/please_no/eyzc7vw/,1567614424.0,1,True,[],False,gaming,t5_2qh03,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now first step is really look at your data plan. What are you getting. You will want to do various speed test in various ways. To determine if you are getting the speeds expected or if the network has issues. 

Fast.com speedtest.net whatsmyip.com 

All good sources. Though they may show different speeds. The goal is to test, wired vs wirless. From router v from modem. The pattern is important as if they are all showing the same pattern. More than not means your are getting a consistent speeds and if it's slow. It's with a bad line from ISP, them modem bad. Or the ISP shafting you.

I can go into more detail here, but I'd rather not. When I helped people with this. It was always an hour + phone call as there are so many variables.

From there need to look at what other devices are on the network. Each device will have a pull and if there are to many devices. It can slow experience.

As for speed you will want to start  around 30-40Mbs. It is unlikely your deivce is gona pull more than that. You will only need high upload speeds if you are going to stream. Though if you have a lot of wireless devices, or internet devices. Go for higher speeds.

If you can avoid modem/router combos. They convenient but aren't very good as they can cause issues with firewalls and DNS settings and just worse for data transfers. So go with deicated hardware, and avoid double NAT as much as possible.

When it comes to setting up your network. You may want to set up port forwarding for the device and the specific game servers you playing. This will help with packet transfers. As well avoid dense materials like cement and metal in walls. This will kill your signal strength.

If possible keep your device on a 5GHz channel. This can be tricky as some routers don't broadcast them. The 5GHz will have higher data transmission. Though can encounter interference from other broadcast devices like baby monitor and the like.

The story isn't that ""The Amazon has been on fire for weeks.""  The Amazon is on fire pretty much all the time.  The amazon is a big place, and pretty much every time lightning strikes the amazon a fire is started somewhere.  yes, the Amazaon has been on fire fore weeks, but that isn't actually noteworthy, as weeks-long fires in the amazon is commonplace.

The actual new is that over the past year, fire occurrences in Brazil have gone up by 84%.  Not just something that has been happening over the past few weeks, but something that has been going on over the past year.

""Well that makes it even worse!  It's been going on for a year now and nobody is talking about it?""

Well hold your horses there.  Fires in the rainforest are monitored via satelite, generally meaning it is the responsability of some government agency to monitor that satelite and let people know when things are off.  Well, INPE, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, does, and did, just that.  They compiled all of the satellite data over the past year, and just yesterday published a report declaring that fires have been on the rise over the past year, and by how much.

So how are we exactly supposed to be able to write an article before yesterday about a report that was only published yesterday?  because we shouldn't write a new article about every single fire that happens in the amazon, fires are a natural part of the Amazon's life cycle.  What is newsworthy is that those fires are happening way more often than they used to, and we are only going to know that if we compile data and publish a report... like was done yesterday.

edit: I really don't mean to minimize the impact of this report: the fact that fires in brazil have gone up by 86% is a big deal! and we should be talking about it!  But we couldn't talk about it before yesterday, because we didn't have the data until yesterday.  maybe we SHOULD have gotten that data sooner!  I don't know!

Client Update	- Valve
Jul 16
A new Steam client has been released and will be automatically downloaded.

General
Improve client logic used to choose and connect to download servers, which should yield better download rates for clients with download servers close to them on the network
Improve connection logic in friends list initialization
Fix screenshots in SteamVR Home
Fixed a bug where a P2P connection would not properly migrate to another relay, if the active relay went offline.
Fixed certain web page elements continuing to render in the Steam client when it is minimized or closed to the system tray
Improved reliability of registry saving on Linux and macOS
Fix the SteamVR dashboard obscuring transition overlays when launching a game.

Steam Input
Added mouse hover to action buttons in Configurator to display which physical buttons are related.
Rework the setting for enabling the Big Picture Mode overlay when using a Steam Input enabled controller from the desktop client. This setting now defaults to off and can be overridden on a per-game basis.
Improve handling of Switch Pro controllers when not universally opted into Steam Input - we will now toggle between DirectInput mode and the extended mode which includes gyro and rumble support depending on whether a game is using Steam Input
Added the GetDeviceBindingRevision function, which allows developers of Steam Input API games to detect out of date user configurations. Configurations with out of date major revisions should be automatically updated by Steam to the latest official configuration, but configurations with out of date minor revisions will be left in-place.
Added Change Player Slot binding to Steam Input. This allows a Steam Input binding to change the player’s x-input slot as seen by a game. This can be mapped to a chord for easy application across all games, and as with all bindings, be set to cycle through slots via an activator. Intended for fighting games and such where a larger set of controllers may need to be regularly and easily swapped across a limited number of player slots.
Rework controller activity detection to require movement of joysticks/triggers instead of just deflection. Should fix wireless PS4/Switch controllers not turning off from inactivity when set down in a way that deflects the triggers or joysticks
Fix an issue with Switch Pro controller joystick input sometimes pulling down when alt-tabbing
Fix a rare crash when connecting a Switch Pro controller

Streaming / Steam Remote Play
Fix a crash when streaming non-Steam game with touch controls enabled 
Fix some other rare crash cases
Fixed a crash when streaming a non-Steam game to the Steam Link app

Big Picture
Properly hide password entry text in the in-game on-screen keyboard
Fix non-Steam Controllers receiving a Steam Controller configuration on the login screen
Fix the “hide device” option in Controller Settings not being shown in some cases
Fix the alignment of the Steam logo in several notifications 

Mac
Fix rare crash at exit
Fix rare crash when a HID device fails to open when no other devices are open 

Linux
Plumb Steam Input’s action set change on cursor visibility feature. This allows for games that show a cursor in menus but not in game, ex: Dark Souls 3, to have separate controls in those contexts
Use the host's zenity program when available for basic dialogs during startup
Fix crash caused by audio cards with no active port set
Improve detection of some linux versions at steam update time

Shader Pre-Caching
More fixes to reduce the download size of Vulkan pipeline pre-caching data

SteamNetworkingSockets

Well, one thing is the brand for the actual game developer (Bethesda Game Studios) and other the publisher (Bethesda Softworks). And just as a extra data, they both have the same parent company (Zenimax Media).

Bethesda Softworks publish a lot of studios in order to appeal a wide range of niches. I particularly enjoy the works of Arkane Studios and ID Software. Polish gameplay, solid IPs and good graphics. As a publisher they also have a fair bussines policy. You can see their target audience is young-mature adults and not teens-young males. They have a fair share of games all over the year and don't have predatory tendencies (at least not like Take-Two Interactive with clears pay to win mechanics).

On the other hand Bethesda Game Studios have a niche market. This is not your typical AAA developer with a story of big budgets and subcontractors around the globe. Because the TES series BGS has a big ROI: low investment, big return. Until 2015 they only have a studio/team on Rockville. Montreal was their first subsidiary and was specialized on mobile games. Because Fallout Shelter they could continue with a big ROI. On 2018 two more studios became part of BGS: Austin and Dallas. They are in a transition to be a bigger brand right now with only two pillars: their IPs (fallout and elder scrolls) and the Creation Engine (Skyrim and Fallout 4 engine and the most criticized software on reddit in the last years).

You are right about the ""team thing"". The Rockville studio let the Austin studio the live development of Fallout 76. But this is a good thing because that team (former Battlecry Studios) was working with Doom on 2016 and they, along ID Software (Doom developers), restructured the Creation Engine to implement multiplayer features.

The Creation's games are really good for their niche: RPG games without a cinematic approach. The environment is build with texts scattered around the open world, filled with scenes telling stories without a cinematic. Imagination does the work. The gameplay let you wandering around the map while you feel part of said world. You avatar is full customizable and has a limited previous story, you can imagine a background if you wish. All of this with quest that can be created easily, the amounts of mods available are proof of that. They are made with the Creation Kit, the tool used by BGS itself to make the game.

[],lalzylolzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_icik7,False,,"&gt; was merely explaining why we don't emulate the human eye and actual realism, and instead games intentionally go for the cinematic look 

Yeah I could've worded it better and definitly see where the confusion can come from, as stated before, my issue lies in a first person perspective being forced into the perspective of basically a mounted camera(that seems convininently placed in the characters eye sockets). It's like a ""POV"" perspective in a video(porn or otherwise), it looks weird and disoriented, not immersive or as if you're there. Video games is causing the same feeling by enforcing those camera features, removing them makes a better first person perspective all around(and\\or using it in contexts that make sense, especially god rays used sparingly and inhibit vision against the sun being the prime examples of where it works well in an unrealistic capacity).  


&gt;  
 Problem is that you are still viewing the game through a screen. 

Definitly is a problem, but it's not a problem solved by having DoF, Motion Blur, Chromatic Aberration or lens flare, is my point and opinion. Every time given an option I turn all of it off and it suddenly feel more realistic and more immersive.  


Depth perception and low resolution is an issue, and the lack of it is why Arma 3 relies heavily on the ability to abritrarily zoom in the view(to help cage distance to object, and the details of it in the distance). Our eyes clearly can't zoom, but it is a gameplay element to help counter these short comings.  Agressive cinematography does not help with this at all, it doesn't mask the problem either, just making things feel more ""Jup, this is a camera \\ video game \\ movie"", not: ""Jup, I am in this world"".  


&gt; Since the closest comparison for us given how our brain actually sees the image, we directly draw the comparison to cinema, and there is pre-established expectation for it to look visually similar to a movie rather than real life.   


I must just be one hell of a weird fucker then, since I naturally draw comparison of vision in a first person game to real life \\ my eyes,  and not what I see in movies, which is where these pet peeves stem from in the first place: FP games do not feel like First Person,  they feel like mounted go-pros positioned inside eye sockets, that is the issue I have, and why I can't stand it.  


&gt;  
  Because it is consumer expectation for the most part (majority of consumers in user tests actually prefer it, and we generally collect the data on what settings you toggle to see what we actually need to expose) and lack of knowledge in other areas (example: how real blood splatters, muzzle flares and gun effects really are. Minor part of the consumers ever actually shot a gun at a living thing, so their expectation is what movies show them, not reality) 

Two part answer so I'll start with first: Blood splatter, muzzle flares etc is very different from DoF, Motion Blur etc.  They serve a gameplay purpose among other(no blood splatter \\ mist means you have no feedback to hits, no feedback to hits would end up with people just going prone to play dead and you'd never tell the difference, infact this is a big issue in Arma \\ insurgency. The low TTK and hectic combat often makes it difficult to tell if you killed someone, or they just lied down, even with blood mists and what not).  


Second:  User tests and focus groups are awful. Focus groups would tell you that the winning formula for a game is a CoD, PUBG\\Fortnite, WoW, or Destiny clone.  Yet any clone of these games often fail. Even if the clone is better and more superior. Metro Exodus, according to focus groups should've been a multiplayer co-op shooter. Yet if it was a multiplayer Co-op shooter it'd not have sold any more copies than it already did(and potentionally be worse recieved as development would've had to be taken from some place to be placed in the co-op\\multiplayer development).

[],Kravego,,,[],,,,text,t2_zfazj,False,,"&gt; Which Sony developed games are releasing on PC? Are we seeing Uncharted? You know Final Fantasy is developed by Square Enix not Sony, they are a third party developer and are free to do what they want.

...

&gt;Nope. Cross play of third party games has got nothing to do with Sony releasing first party exclusives on PC.

...

&gt;You still don't seem to have a clue what a first party exclusive title is vs some third party cross platform game.

I know what the difference is you absolute nitwit. People buy consoles for exclusives, period. First party games make up a *portion* of those exclusives. 

If you honestly believe that in the next couple generations when nearly every game is cross platform someone is going to shell out $500+ for 2 or 3 first party games you're delusional. 

The number of exclusives of note is dropping markedly as gaming architectures merge, and so to is the ""exclusives"" draw of consoles. 

&gt;What on Earth are you talking about? Big triple A titles on console are break record all the time with multimillion sales within days which is something that's a little more rare on the PC side as people tend to wait for Steam sales.

People wait for steam sales at the same rate that people wait for used copies of console games. There's literally no data to suggest otherwise. 

&gt;You do know that it's infinitely easier to pirate on the PC than it is on a console, right?

Pirating is not a major deterrent to AAA game developers. It might have a small effect on indie publishers.

&gt;Please share how this is happening. You keep saying it but you never show an example.

I've already stated how blockhead. Traditionally exclusive series are being released on now being released on PC. More every quarter. 

&gt;Not even close. When you control the platform you control everything. On the PC side they can't charge you to play online, they suddenly get zero royalties from all third party sales and have to pay other PC game providers like Steam or Epic a cut of each sale to even have access to the user base. You see, it's a shit show all around from Sony's point of view. There is no way they can even think of monetizing any of their services without an platform of their own. Do you understand now why there is no incentive?

They give Steam, Epic, etc a cut of the sale to have access to *LITERALLY MILLIONS* of paying customers. That's not a bad deal for developers, and you're fucking mentally unstable if you seriously think that a first party game released on Steam wouldn't be profitable for Sony. 

&gt;Sony is the console market leader right now and has zero fucks to give about the PC market and have yet to release any first party exclusive games on anything but their platform.

&gt;If you are so dying to play these Sony exclusives just buy a Playstation 4/5 and enjoy those games. It's foolish to think Sony would every give up when they are at the top of their game. They are making millions upon millions basically selling air (Playstation Plus) why would they give up that $59.99USD coming in per year from 36.3 million users? Playstation made $78 billion for Sony in 2018, they simply don't need the PC for anything.

I said nothing about **need**. Could Sony continue their merry way and stay siloed on a single hardware platform? Sure.

[],nimsony,,,[],,,,text,t2_15pwjg,False,,"I understand that the post is a joke, but it definitely highlights how little people know about what HDR is, even though it's become such a big deal these days.

HDR stands for High Dynamic Range, we're talking about the amount of light / colour being processed by your equipment / software.
In photography you have limited range due to the physical nature of the lens, using HDR techniques allows you to capture light beyond those limits, produces images that cover much wider ranges of light, they can look somewhat surreal, or natural depending on how you handle the extra data, this is called Tonemapping.

In games we have the same limitations with screen colours, usually 256 possible brightness values for each of your primary colour LEDs, this means that the in game images and lighting used to be handled within that range, meaning we could pretty much see all brightnesses that are in the scene at any time, highly unrealistic.
HDR in this case isn't just used at a post processing level, the whole graphics pipeline has been upgraded to cover the extra data, HDR capable lights bake lighting in to HDR capable images that store more than a normal image does, this is then used by effects like Bloom to handle brightness settings in a much more realistic way, we're no longer looking at light as a set of limited range colours, instead we can use real world values of light so outdoor areas are super bright compared to indoor areas.
Effects like Tonemapping (yes same as photography) are then used to reproduce the limitations of camera hardware, making the results much more real, and less surreal like they would normally look without any of this.

HDR screens are another thing that uses the same principles, except we've increased the physical limit range of the previously mentioned LEDs, so we can throttle the colours down less using the tonemapping.",1565630040,{},ewozbsu,False,t3_cpauex,False,True,t3_cpauex,/r/gaming/comments/cpauex/photography_vs_videogames/ewozbsu/,1565630045.0,1,True,,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1: it stops in 2012, and has a kind of high bar for what a mass shooting is ( 4+ people killed seems high, but it's whatever) (kind of a non point, just wanted to say it's a little out of date)

2: France is lower in just about every chart they have, not sure why you said France was higher.

3. Europe is generally lower than the US in all of the charts on the pages 20s. Execpt northern Europe, which somehow has 20+ people killed per mass shooting? I think Norway is affecting that with it's 1 mass shooting, in which 67 (69 according to Wikipedia) people died. Holy shit.

4. On that last note, Finland had 3, with 23 people total, Switzerland had 1, with 14 people total, France had 4, with 20 people total. That's like, not a ton of data to go on. The US had meanwhile had 43, with 325 people total. Much larger numbers and sample sizes, and much better to use averages for.

5: kind of irrelevant, but the coffee cup story is actually really sad. The woman admitted she spilled it on herself, and almost died because of it because the McDonald's severed the coffee at over 100° because they had such shitty beans. She just wanted them to help her out on her medical bills, but they only offered her a discount coupon for her next meal. So she sued them, and it became a whole big thing.

[],CatalyticDragon,,,[],,,,text,t2_3h1nb,False,,"The limit is how many compute devices they can scale over. The Vulkan API being used doesn't care how many devices you access so it is down to how much effort developers want to put in. Scaling software over multiple devices is hard. We've had multi-core CPUs for 60 years and scaling over them is still not always perfect.

The base servers for Stadia will feature some number of dual GPU boards. Considering density and power draw that will be 4-8 I'm guessing. 

Obviously it is easy to use one GPU (which is where we get the 10TFLOP number) and there will be titles using two-GPUs. We know this because Google showed off an example of multi-GPU in use with their Firestrike demo and alternate frame 'SLI' is pretty easy and efficient under Vulkan. We have good examples of this on the desktop already like Strange Brigade so it's super simple to port that to Stadia.

Developers have been highly reluctant to spend time optimizing for multiple GPUs since the market share has been absolutely minuscule but Stadia might change that. Every instance has the option to use more than one GPU so there might be more inventive to leverage that.

Thinking ahead there is no reason a Stadia instance couldn't present 2,4, or 8 GPUs to the software. A clever developer could have access to up to 80 raw TFLOPS but using that effectively would be a mammoth undertaking. Not impossible but a big effort and we might only get 50-80% utilization (depends entirely on what they are trying to do). 

It remains to be seen if there is a market for that but I'm optimistic.

Remember when Crytek showed off ray tracing on a 10 TFLOP Vega 56? Imagine you had one GPU doing standard rasterization and pipeline management and another GPU just for ray tracing calculations. Or two GPUs doing AFR rasterization and two GPUs handling ray tracing effects.

You can slice and dice anyway you like. Have an entire GPU just handling the minimap if you like. However synchronising data between them all is where the big challenge lies.

Get that wrong and you stall waiting for a GPU which kills your frame rate. That's been the traditional problem in DX11 SLI. Luckily DX12/Vulkan have made huge leaps in this area but I still wouldn't expect to see scaling beyond two GPUs in the first iteration of this service and even then it'll take a while for it to get anywhere near mainstream.

Then to really start scaling up over many GPUs we need faster, lower latency connections. AMD has been working on this with mainstream PCIe4.0 support and xGMI patches already in the linux kernel. CXL is another piece of the puzzle but whereas PCIe4 and xGMI are ready now devices using the next-gen CXL protocol won't be along for years.

The reason I stopped at 8 GPUs is because any more and you probably need to shift data to another server. The latency incurred in that is just too great for real-time graphics.

[],HulloHoomans,,,[],,,,text,t2_14fg71,False,,"A more realistic comparison regarding European nations would be to compare them to individual US states.  They're generally comparable in terms of population and area.  

There are numerous states in America that go decades with no mass shootings, and the same goes for European nations.  Just looking at the per capita death rate from mass shootings can be misleading depending on how it's parsed, and that's where people like to bring up Breivik.  But the incident rate may be more informative.  1 incident over 10 years seems like no big deal, some might say.  But there are plenty of US states that have only 1 incident in 10 years, many with none.  Looking at all of Europe compared to US on a per-state, per-country basis, more US states have had more shooting-free years than European countries have.  In fact, the only US state with a non-zero mean death toll from mass shootings is California, the state with the strictest gun control laws.  So, no, you shouldn't discount the Breivik incident on the basis that it was just that one time.

Meanwhile, looking at the total casualty count per incident is something significant that's worth considering, as it shows you how much resistance a shooter faces once they start shooting.  Breivik was totally uninhibited for over an hour until Delta finally arrived on the island.  Likewise, it took police over an hour to locate and then breach the door to get to Stephen Paddock once he started shooting.  Both of those incidents had exceptionally huge body counts.  Even so, the USA still has below average death counts per incident compared to other developed nations.  It's worth exploring the causes for that.

Lastly, as an aside, gun-control advocates in the media love to throw around numbers from Adam Lankford's study that pinned the US as having an absurdly out-sized proportion of all worldwide gun violence and mass shootings.  Given that a major tenet of the scientific process is replication of results, and that Lankford refuses to share his data or methodology with other researches, *no one* should be using his study for *anything*, especially when more recent independent results totally contradict it while being fully transparent in their methods.

Besides, no one actually seems to care about air pollution. There is a very strong link between how many feet you live from a road, and the cars per hour and bone loss... and stroke/heart attack. Yet, I don't see anyone buying activated carbon air filters for their car so they aren't breathing that in, for their whole commute. Or filters in their house...

&amp;#x200B;

Car exhaust inhibits calcium in the blood from bonding to your bones, causing bone loss and elevated blood calcium... linked to heart attacks and stoke. There is also some evidence that it is contributing to dementia.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough, we are moving from larger engines with more cylinders to smaller engines with fewer cylinders (but with turbos) to get very tiny improvements in fuel economy... but the end result is the exhaust is dirtier... The engine's lifespan is shortened, and requires more maintenance (usually doesn't get done, so it runs even worse). A good bit of the carbon emitted by cars is... making new cars. You are better off driving an old car into the ground than buying a new one, from a carbon emissions standpoint.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, a Ford 5.4L Triton engine gets about 15-16mpg with a big V8 and burns very cleanly (it can even run E85 and extract another 10-15HP out of it)... But the new V6 ecoboost trucks (in real world usage) get within about 1 or 2 mpg of that, but they don't burn anywhere near as cleanly... They only seem attractive because they are gaming the EPA mpg tests.  


But no one really cares... No one wants scientific data, they just want to appear to do something they can get social media points for. All that matters is it ""sounds"" good... and anything dissenting, no matter how much evidence there is... is silenced.  


Unfortunately, solar and wind (and electric cars) aren't going to save us... They can help but it won't be enough.  
The industries behind them aren't being honest about how much carbon is emitted manufacturing solar panels, and the batteries that will be needed to make them effective... or that solar and wind cause local heating. Solar panels degrade (and make less power) as they generate power, they have a limited useful lifespan... same with batteries for storing the power.

If the numbers were great, they would be shouting it from the rooftops... but instead we have some vague 3rd party guesses.

One way to do it is to give your AI a big list of training data of images (in nintendo's case this would probably be level data) that you know do and don't have penises. The AI doesn't know anything other than the pixel data of the image, aka it can ""see"" the image but that's it. The AI also wants as high a score as possible. You tell it to figure out which images are penises. You subtract points when it guesses wrong, and add points when it gets it right. The AI, overtime, will evolve to get better and better at figuring out if there are penis or not based on the images you give it, because it wants more points.

Once you get it to a high enough accuracy, you can apply it to images outside your training data. You have now built a penis detector.

On PC, you only need Google chrome so it opens the doors to PC players who want access to console exclusives but for mobiles gamers, the potential market is not ~50% of the population who play mobile and not console, but more like 20%-25% assuming half the world uses Android (I think the reality is that 60% of the population have an iPhone.) So right there, much of the casual market is excluded.

After that, the article says that casual gamers spend about $100 a year on their mobiles games. Now this point depends on how stadia charges their users because if you have to buy the full game as well as a stadia subscription, $100 will buy you 1 game and the subscription as each triple A game costs about $60. And if a stadia subscription costs more than about $25 a month, it's better to save for a year and buy a console than spend that $25 a month because then you can actually own your products and content even after you stop using them. You don't lose your data or access to it with consoles but if stadia kills your data after deleting your account, you may have to pay all over again and that doesn't sound like spending habits of mobile gamers who pay $100 on average for their games

And lastly, this all depends on if stadia is worth it. Gamers have always been promised beautiful graphics, amazing frame rates, and high speed connections only to be given endless crap. A new comer who claims to give a console experience by streaming games without drawbacks sounds like bullshit to us. For casual gamers who don't know the difference, this may be a god send and it may not matter, but gaming companies have been known to promise mountains and deliver a pile of dog shit disguised as a mole hill so this experience might be so bad that even casual gamer may find the experience unplayable.

All that said, if stadia is aforable and good, I'll absolutely buy into it and I think many PC gamers would too, but few of any of us are holding our breath for a good experience which is why we don't believe this will take off for anyone outside casual gamers",1563587721,{},eu9qcui,False,t3_cfftn5,False,True,t3_cfftn5,/r/gaming/comments/cfftn5/as_a_casual_this_article_makes_sense_to_me_reddit/eu9qcui/,1563587722.0,3,True,,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,0.0,,,,1563674123.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparing people who play free mobile games to people who would buy a AAA simply makes no sense. He also banks a lot of people making this an impulse purchase, but I highly doubt that considering how complicated all of the different tiers of membership are. Most people who weren’t big gamers and would be buying on an impulse would just buy a single game, not a subscription. Stadia makes a very small amount of the money off of game sales versus memberships so this wouldn’t be a very good business model. Also people who make impulse purchases will probably leave angry because again they are mobile gamers and don’t really understand all of the lingo around internet connectivity and data usage.

As i said, future proofing models doesn't mean they last forever, if they made theyre models in 3DSMax, for exemple, and they changed the game engine to an engine that doesn't support this format, they have to redo some of the model in another modelling software, i'm trying to not be too technical about it, but it does take a lot of time, so might as well start over. If you sit down and try to learn at least the basics of 3D modelling you will see that things are just not that easy and finding people that can model in that quality standard is stupidly expensive, Nintendo is a Giant, PokeCo is a giant, but Game Freak is not, it's a rare case when the subsidiary is way bigger than the main company.

&gt; The emulator creators do not change individual Pokémon geometry and animations now, do they? 

Here's the thing, emulator need a lot of processing power because they are not emulating just the software of the platform you are runing, they are emulating the Hardware of the device and low level stuff like BIOS, and making corrections at run time, so the computer is indeed fixing the animations and models in real time, that's why a modern computer can have issues runing old PS2 games and get broken animations and textures, because the archtecture is just too weird and different and the GPU or CPU just don't know how to deal with it,  PS3 was not a specially powerful machine, but it's processor work in a way so different than computer processors that most emulators are still in alpha and not being able to make quick progress. 

In 2D games this is not a big issue, but 3D games are another animal entirely. Emulation is a super interesting topic and i could go on about it for days, if you want.

&gt;  They didn't have to start gain with those models. It wasn't as simple as copy and paste, but they've still had some work saved for them. 

The amount of work they had done was not very helpful, and i will go so far to say that you don't know this, i know, Game Freak use their on In-House developed engine with some third-party frameworks to develop their stuff. If they made changes to modernize the engine to be compatible to Switch, or entirely remade the stuff, so it could be just uncompatible with the models, this is not otherwordly stuff and happens all the time in the industry, it was for this exact reason that you couldn't transfer pokémon from the second to third generation, they had just so much more data because they made a more powerful engine to run on a more powerful hardware that it was basically impossible to convert it, Models are data, so the same could have happened.

&gt; but this apparent laziness is keeping me away.  

Again, i see no laziness on their part, just the usual business bullshit and some development constraints that every project goes trough, why do you thing Nintendo don't reused resources from Mario Galaxy and Skyward Sword in Mario Odssey and BotW? Because they couldn't. BotW wasn't ported, it used and specific engine for the project that could compile both Switch and Wii U games, same with Mario Odssey, you think everything is so easy to do but you actually have no clue about how much people work on videogame industry work and just don't know how much work is to make just a single pixel move from the ground, you think Crunching is a new and unorthodox practice? I have **very** bad news for you. Game Freak and Nintendo are Old Style developers, they try to keep the development proccess as much as in house as possible so they can deliver better quality.

&gt; It is not as much work to reuse old models as it is to create new ones, or they simply wouldn't be using old models. Your logic is flawed. 

As i stated before, that might not be entirely possible, just that. I will only know for sure when i datamine the data from SnS and check for myself, but by the look of it, it just wasn't possible.

&gt; Game Freak is big enough to cope with the demand of this work. The fact that they haven't shows its a move of greed and future marketing 

First, who makes this kind of decision is PokeCo, they just say what will be in a game to GF and they develop based on those demands, second, it's a Company, their jobs is to make money, and not to please you, if they see a market that is more profitable, of course they are going to attack that market, that's business as usual, and PokeCo always operated on that way.",1562255405,{},essowap,False,t3_c8j6fg,False,True,t1_esshot5,/r/gaming/comments/c8j6fg/get_off_your_asses_and_help_the_gaming_community/essowap/,1562255417.0,1,True,,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,0.0,,,,1562427898.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right now, no one knows. This is partly because many would consider the very idea frivolous. But it's also because whoever successfully answers this question must first have answered several others.

Why do we cry? Why do we laugh, or love, or smile? What are the touchstones of our emotions?

Until now, the people who asked such questions tended not to be the same people who ran software companies. Instead, they were writers, filmmakers, painters, musicians. They were, in the traditional sense, artists.

We're about to change that tradition. The name of our company is Electronic Arts.

### Software worthy of the minds that use it.

We are a new association of electronic artists united by a common goal—to fulfill the enormous potential of the personal computer.

In the short term, this means transcending its present use as a facilitator of unimaginative tasks and a medium for blasting aliens. In the long term, however, we can expect a great deal more.

These are wondrous machines we have created, and in them can be seen a bit of their makers. It is as if we had invested them with the image of our minds. And through them, we are learning more and more about ourselves.

We learn, for instance, that we are more entertained by the involvement of our imaginations than by passive viewing and listening. We learn that we are better taught by experiences than by memorization. And we learn that the traditional distinctions—the ones that are made between art and entertainment and education—don't always apply.

### Towards a language of dreams.

In short, we are finding that the computer can be more than just a processor of data.

It is a communications medium: an interactive tool that can bring people's thoughts and feelings closer together, perhaps closer than ever before. And while fifty years from now, its creation may seem no more important than the advent of motion pictures or television, there is a chance it will mean something more.[\[6\]](http://chrishecker.com/Can_a_Computer_Make_You_Cry%3F#cite_note-6)

Something along the lines of a universal language of ideas and emotions. Something like a smile.

The first publications of Electronic Arts are now available.[\[7\]](http://chrishecker.com/Can_a_Computer_Make_You_Cry%3F#cite_note-7) We suspect you'll be hearing a lot about them. Some of them are games like you've never seen before, that get more out of your computer than other games ever have. Others are harder to categorize—and we like that.

### Watch us.

We're providing a special environment for talented, independent software artists. It's a supportive environment, in which big ideas are given room to grow. And some of America's most respected software artists are beginning to take notice.

We think our current work reflects this very special commitment. And though we are few in number today and apart from the mainstream of the mass software marketplace, we are confident that both time and vision are on our side.

A Music Artist who uses and is very proficient with say Logic Pro or other Macintosh-only Music Production software and has a streamlined workflow with the program is going to place inherent value in their ability to continue to use that software. Of course, there are Music Studio type programs on Windows-  They COULD do their work there. But that is still a transition. They need to buy the other program- Say, Ableton Live or Fruity Loops- and how do they choose? They need to learn how to use it. And some of the data files they might have put together for their previous work probably won't load in the new one. Maybe they have say a bunch of samples as part of an extensive library they've built over years and carefully organized, and now they have to basically figure out how to convert them or reorganize them and all that.

Certain levels of Graphic design need very careful color calibration and Color Profiles. Mac OS has always been worlds ahead of Windows in those terms, and therefore graphics work that is going to a Large Scale Printer Company is far more reliable.

Similarly, in the past, many more professional applications- were either Mac Only or were far better applications on the Macintosh version. As a result, many professionals have stuck to what has worked for them. Even if there is a Windows version, which means that such people *could* instead buy a PC and use the Windows Version, they could very easily ascribe more value to their own time they would spend making that transition to the point that it's more ""cost effective"" for them to get even a very expensive Macintosh Computer; Particularly considering that it's likely that while they adapt to the new system (and any differences in the software) They will probably be less productive and get less done and possibly make less money. When you consider the time investment to switch OS (particularly if unfamiliar with Windows), the lost revenue from any loss of productivity, and possibly the prices of any big software licenses they might need, It's completely possible that a Macintosh could actually be *less* expensive.

You can still pace yourself in your own way if the show is released weekly, just wait until they've finished airing the show. You say people enjoy things in different ways, well, for those of us who want a weekly schedule, we literally can't do that the way Netflix currently releases shows, so we're the only ones being punished.

&gt;Again, I do see your point and I think Netflix wants to be known as 'different' whether that's good or bad for them in the long term. I am not saying what they are doing is right or wrong, I'm just saying how they may be doing it because it's a 'brave new world' and old habits need to be shaken. 

I think we agree here, but I also think that this was more true 5 years ago when they didn't have any competition and they could do whatever the hell they wanted than it is now when everyone else has smartened up. They built an unsustainable model based on the fact that no standards existed in this area. I think we're in total agreement based on what you say next about them dying off over the next decade, I've been saying this exact same thing for a while now, they're a singular business model with no other revenue streams and few assets outside of their content.  Look at how Disney and Apple are drastically undercutting their price point, because they can afford to take a loss on this for years so they can grow market share and accumulate user data.

You said in a post that ""the environment is doing better now than before"" and i call bullshit on that too. The fact that, *statistically* (not 'i feel this way', raw data that is factual) our planet has been gathering greenhouse gasses and been making the temperatures more extreme (thats right, hotter summers and colder winters. Both are effects of global warming. They picked a dumb name, but hey, how else do you spread information to dumb people?). Those are, again, factual points of data. In the last few years we have had a LOT of ""record breaking"" weather. Heat, rain, snow, etc. You name it, it has probably hit in record breaking amounts in the last 5 years, if that. 

The planet, as a whole ecosystem, has done the same thing for a very long time with only some variance. We have, since i have been alive (not even 30 yet) have seen 'record' after 'record' broken since recorded history. 

And you can still sit here and say its not a problem? Yeah, people have been pretty informed about it since the 70's. They were probably worried about it then.

Yes. Because I'm an **informed** progressive that doesn't just make knee jerk, emotional pleas for action based my own whims, prejudices and a willing ignorance of the facts.

According to the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics data, the entire Big Ten (including Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins) conference combined brought in $1,604,840,000 in 2017 across all sports programs (which includes various subsidization funds collected from non-athletic students and taxpayers). Their expenses ran $1,631,500,000. 

So across all the schools of the Big Ten, they made a profit of $26,660,000. 

So, if you took the entire profit made from Big Ten collegiate athletics programs and 'shared' every cent of it with only the Big Ten college football players, each football player would get $19,602.94 a year (85 player roster x 16 teams = 1360 players total. $26,660,000 profit/1360 players = $19602.94). Of course, in that scenario, Basketball players and participants in every other sport would get zilch. Start adding in more sports and the share each player gets drops dramatically.

So, do still think it makes sense to 'share' profits with athletes when in reality, even if you limited it to football, basketball, baseball, hockey and olympic sports, if every athlete was payed the same, it'd probably put less than a $100 in the pockets of each individual athlete each month at the expense of eliminating the means for colleges to support anything at the college that doesn't generate a profit?",1568578380,{},f0f5t3v,False,t3_d45ut2,False,True,t1_f0ezjkc,/r/television/comments/d45ut2/tim_tebow_called_out_by_espn_colleagues_media_nfl/f0f5t3v/,1568579252.0,1,True,[],False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,1568578766.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],Gumbi1012,,,[],,,,text,t2_bbqgz,False,,"&gt; Regardless too many people are comparing themselves to media extremes and photoshop bullshit

I agree this is a problem. It isn't always related to weight though. A lot of it is media filters, Photoshop and steroids being used together to promote unattainable looks. Weight isn't always a factor. But it can be and yes it can be toxic, absolutely, I agree.

&gt; being “overweight” BMI between 25 and 30 correlates poorly with longevity at least in the US. Hazard ratio of about 15%. Hypertension, diabetes, heart disease are all only slightly more likely. Smoking , high meat diet , sedentary life style absolutely risky. Simply being “overweight” no.

But a BMI of 25 is considered overweight! It's 30+ that is obese.

&gt; You can see someone is overweight at a glance. You can’t tell if they’re healthy however until you get to know them better.  Again, it depends on what your definition of healthy is. Considering the sheer amount of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease at the moment, you'd be more right than wrong at assuming they *are* unhealthy without even seeing them! That's how bad it is. But of course, a lot of these issues are chronic diseases which can take many years to develop but are damaging nonetheless.

In any case, this isn't about judging individuals, it's about educating the population. At the end of the day, a healthy overweight person is, according to the literature, the exception and not the rule.

&gt; Now I know this is controversial as there are good reasons to suspect actual disease processes with being underweight, but there still seems to be some risk even in healthy underweight. I looked up the BMIs of several top tier actresses (obviously this isn’t perfect reliable data) and they were all well below 20. Which means the standards put forth on the silver screen are significantly less healthy than being overweight.

No one is denying being underweight isn't dangerous. It's just not as big an issue as being overweight!

If you read my previous comment, I addressed the issue of a slightly increased risk for those between 18.5 and 20 BMI. The study I linked controlled for smoking (which tends to help people lose weight actually, because it suppresses appetite, among other things) and other factors, and this increased risk all but disappeared.

In other words, it's not being that weight that's the issue, but the smoking that's the issue. Whereas, in accordance with the literature I quoted above, not only is being overweight correlated with a multitude of Heath issues, beIN overweight is in and of itself and independent risk factor in chronic disease.

Don't worry about being defensive. It's a divisive issue and I'm only trying to convey what i believe (and I believe it's what supported by the science). But this isn't about judging individuals or putting them down. But is it about educating the public on the risks of unhealthful eating and the dangers of being too heavy.",1567911249,{},ezhjimu,False,t3_d0wa40,False,True,t1_ezhh4fg,/r/television/comments/d0wa40/bill_maher_weighs_in_on_us_obesity_fat_shaming/ezhjimu/,1567911261.0,1,True,[],False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You are really starting to piss me off with your straw mans and lies. He was talking about how other physical and mental conditions are the underlying factors of obesity. Such as (but not limited to) symptoms from depression, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, and chronic pain.

&gt; “The positive energy balance underlying obesity is generally attributed to chronic excess energy intake or reduced physical activity. Unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are the “big 2” on which almost all preventive and therapeutic programs for obesity are focused, thereby neglecting other possible contributors to excess body weight. Although intuitively appealing, clear evidence (eg, individual-level epidemiologic data and randomized experiments) beyond ecological correlations is lacking for the big 2.2 Many other putative contributors to the increase in obesity (eg, insufficient sleep, psychological stress, endocrine disruptors, medications, intrauterine and intergenerational effects, etc) have supportive evidence that is as compelling as, if not more compelling than, the evidence for the big 2.3,4 These nontraditional or new determinants of obesity influence energy input and output; overeating and reduced energy expenditure are perceived as “symptoms” and not as the root causes of the excess weight.5 On the treatment side, an accumulating body of evidence shows that insufficient sleep can impede weight loss and addressing sleep for weight management has recently been endorsed by the Canadian Obesity Network.6 Overall, accumulating evidence suggests that health practitioners and clinicians might need to consider a broader range of influential factors (eg, medications, lack of time, psychological stress, fatigue, chronic pain) to adequately identify and address the key factors responsible for the patient’s obesity, which is likely a clinical sign of chronic caloric “retention” (similar to edema being a clinical sign of fluid “retention”).5 This will enable health practitioners and clinicians to develop a personalized framework that addresses the root causes of patients’ weight gain.

First, rather than comparing the actual survival rate of all new programming, they instead selected only cancelled shows and try to backfill information. Second, the timeframe chosen is neither sufficient nor appropriate. 

Third, the comparison of mean survival length is not appropriate because the data is right-censored. This means that long-running shows are currently ongoing, and we do not know how long in the future they will survive, while cancelled shows are cancelled, and we know how long they survive. This is a problem because streaming services did not spin up programming until 2014-2015. Thinking of this in simple and reductive, if you want your average show life to be longer, then for every one season cancellation, you need a 5-6 or more season show. Netflix has shows currently that will become 5-6 season shows, but because most of its programming is fewer than 5 years old, we can't actually estimate where things will land. 

If you want a thought experiment to try to convince yourself of this last criticism, pretend you want to know how long marriages last based on age group (Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z), because you think Kids These Days are more likely to get divorced. So you check the mean length of Gen X marriage versus Gen Z marriage. Some Gen Xers have 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 4 year marriages that fail quickly while others have marriages last 25 or more years. Gen Z people are younger. You see many of the 1 year, 2 year marriages, because those have failed, but it's not possible to see a 5+ year marriage because the participants are too young, even though many of the marriages will last that long. Is it appropriate to compare the average length of marriages in this case?

I'm not saying my comment is the be all and end all, but what I mean is that this information is not being appropriately contextualized and the headline is misleading.

Here is how I would do the analysis: gather data on all scripted television series on big 4, cable, and streaming starting around 2012-2013. Fit a cox proportional hazard model on the data, separating by network (so instead of using one model for all the data with e.g. fixed effects of network of origin, allow the actual baseline model to differ in shape). Then compare. Cox PH is appropriate because it allows us to look at the probability of surviving one season, the probability of surviving two seasons conditional on surviving one, etc. This would still not fully solve the right-censorship problem, that's an additional modelling concern we'd have to take into account.",1565284503,{},ewcgmwe,False,t3_cnnaca,False,True,t3_cnnaca,/r/television/comments/cnnaca/your_favorite_netflix_shows_are_more_likely_to_be/ewcgmwe/,1565284507.0,1,True,,False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike typical television networks, Netflix has complete data regarding viewer behavior. So while a lot of their shows might have a small and dedicated following, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they won’t be cut. 

A few years ago there was an AMA from someone at SyFy, and I asked a question about how science fiction was a little bit of a niche genre that is usually accompanied by high production costs. And the response I got was interesting, and relevant to this discussion. Basically, the SyFy exec pointed out that every so often a science fiction TV show will hit a nerve and become incredibly popular. And that’s what they were looking to produce. 

The reason that’s relevant is that SyFy also got a lot of shit for canceling pretty good shows. But that’s the thing. These networks aren’t just looking to produce under-appreciated shows. They want to hit the zeitgeist.

Ok, I'm in the same boat, although I've had it a bit easier I'd assume. I ended up in a boarding home around 16(parents split at a much younger age).

I worked odd jobs, at one point I was doing 90 hour weeks for a sales job, but only got paid 40 bucks(cheeky contract), got out of that and used my credit card for some steel cap boots for the next job, but my manager stole those and wouldn't return them.

Did some study around 18-20 but didn't manage to graduate. Did more odd jobs, and eventually got some stable work at a casino doing night shifts. 5 years into that, went back into university while doing casino nightshifts to pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. Graduated. Couldn't find work though for about a year(that'd use my qualification), casino took me in for under the table work doing my hobby of programming.

Wrote software and designed the UI(my studies were in 2D/3D graphics for film and games) for a learning app on PC and mobile devices with interactive simulations and tests that'd train croupiers with new skills. A digital improved version of the paper manuals. Finished that after a year and it was successful. I did that for under 10 grand, vendors had been bidding in the six figure range. IT department took my software from there and said I was useless, got sent back to the floor to deal blackjack again without being able to defend myself. I quit.

I used my savings to get by, but eventually ran dry and ended up getting government welfare support. Did a short course over 3 months on Software Testing / QA, did the exam and got certified. Again not much luck finding work for that, most roles were intermediate or above, I went to meetup groups monthly to network and engaged with online community. Took night classes on C# with another short course, this one didn't require upfront payment, they'd take a cut of your pay once you were working. At the end was a volunteer project for a TEDX event sponsor to create a video wall that'd display tweets in real-time with the events hashtag, and a mood that would meet the clients request for reacting by changing colour and playing some sound, at the end of a talk, the speaker could see the tweets replied(at a faster pace) and see how the audience engaged with their talk. It was my first time working with web technology, I lead a team of 4, did an 80 hour week, flew down to the city the event was at for on-site support.

Next role I'm at an IoT startup earning minimum wage. I handle the website, write some mobile apps and backend services among some other tasks(mentoring less experienced staff, contributing towards the direction of the business, saving the company money etc). A client needs to get smartphone app to wirelessly replace the wired touchpad device to their product. Some reverse engineering is done, I've never used C before or worked with embedded hardware but pick it up over 6 weeks and deliver an MVP, the client is ecstatic, apparently they've had trouble finding a company that could pull it off for several years now, we land a six figure contract. Later on, my employer betrays me and continues to push more expectations and demands on me(I'm already work 11am-9pm mon-fri and only getting paid 40 hours min wage), resulting outcome is I quit(I was also being badly treated/harassed).

They refuse to give any positive reference, I don't have a degree, finding work proves difficult in the field but I keep at it and keep upskilling and improving my CV. Eventually I get work at a photogrammetry and VR company, I use my 3D skills as well as my programming skills(this time with Rust and Python). I make it possible to process data at levels that were previously not reachable by the company allowing much bigger client projects to be taken on, I handle technical art and troubleshooting when other artists have issues, improve the pipeline with better approaches and tools, train up the artists, provide my own insights towards growing the business and briefly  help co-run it and managing the finances, I'm given directorship. I later step down and leave the company due to the founder not keeping to their terms of agreement, a condition was not met like it should have been to retain me at the company and I was not happy with how the company was being run(not enough influence to change it), staff weren't treated as well as they should be. Fun fact, I didn't make any money while there, I had money allocated to keeping the business going and growing and seeing other talent was paid, when it came to a point that I should have been paid, I was given bullshit excuses and belittled.

I've volunteered my skills towards several other communities, given back to the community, etc. I keep at it, further developing my skills and value and doing my best to overcome any obstacles. I'm 33 now, and the most money I've ever made was 20/hour dealing blackjack. I've made more money unloading trucks of lumber or working in a warehouse than I've made doing far more complex and mentally exhausting technical work with technology, because on paper I look like quite the failure. 

I didn't complete highschool(worked at burger king to keep myself fed and pay rent), I had quals but they weren't degrees so they didn't matter, I've had long bouts of unemployment and no employer at the tiny startups I worked at and helped considerably have anything nice to say(they got nasty towards me when I chose to leave due to circumstances). Doesn't matter how good my skills are, I'm a big risk vs alternative choices(it's not like the industry isn't competitive with talent), so other candidates get chosen. When I do land interviews I do well and typically reach the final few candidates for a role. One had a 3 month process and was 3 hours of transit each way, I'd have to be up by 4am to arrive at 8am start, then not be home until around 9pm, I would have taken the role too.

&gt; I know lazy when I hear it, and yeah, you're lazy.

**What am I doing that makes me lazy? **

What are you suggesting I should do that would not count as lazy other than learning something that you approve of vs learning something that makes more of a difference in my life and can change my situation?(knowing about dark matter isn't going to get me out of poverty)

&gt; But so what? I didn't say you're stupid, I didn't say you're a bad person, 

You called me anti-intellectual earlier, just because I have a different stance towards what knowledge should be pursued, not that I was against expanding knowledge and self-improvement/awareness, but just because I gave priority to knowledge in other domains and deemed knowing about topics such as dark matter as irrelevant / low-value to most people.

&gt; I said you're lazy. Which fortunately is an utterly fixable condition.

If I'm so lazy, wtf are the people that don't even try? 

Do you not remember what it's like to be poor / homeless(I've briefly been in that situation but nothing too serious thankfully as I had access to a shelter). 

&gt; For those people, what you're posting isn't a slippery slope, it's a fucking cliff dive.

If a person can't think for themselves, and some how manages to ruin their life from reading a comment from me on a subreddit about television and a fictional tv show, I don't really care. That's not my fault, there's already enough wrong with them by that point for my comment expressing a viewpoint to be the apparent cause that fucks them over.

Media is already well known to bend the truth, even when it's not fictional. I'd love it if a show was more factually accurate, especially when it comes to all the pain points I have with how technology is often misrepresented, far more prevalent than things like dark matter is in shows.

There's enough wrong with the world, more than I could impact and change. I help others where I can, but I also have to consider my own future and wellbeing. For any ""moron"" that would read what I've said, I'd hope that they actually benefit by realizing that being informed is a great thing, but don't waste time learning about things that aren't relevant to your life in the now and going to make any real difference to you, not when you're in a situation where you should prioritize your time to acquire knowledge that is of greater personal value. Nothing lazy at all in that.

[],OwnRound,,,[],,,,text,t2_20zwi854,False,,"&gt; Im sorry but season 8 was nowhere close to being game of thrones.

At no point did I say that it was so I don't know what you're apologizing for.  Its not a controversial opinion.

&gt;Its almost like they did the opposite of everything preceding it just to piss everyone off. Thats not having a bad day, thats plain sabotage. Maybe even subconsciously they hated the show because they were the worst parts of it and they didnt like it when people made fun of their dorne storyline. 

This is just way too conspiracy theory-ish to me.  I've sat in those writers rooms trying to develop a script.  A blank page is way more intimidating than you can imagine and exponentially more intimidating when you're stressed out of your mind, when you have rabid fans that expect perfection and the rest of your career on the line.  You sit with it for months, for literally hours a day.  It consumes everything you do.  Its all you get to think about.  The idea that they wanted to sabotage it is as bad writing as Game of Thrones season 8.  You're not really doing the critical thinking to actually think about what it means to take your lifes work, others lifes work(actors, production, everybody involved) and sabotage it for little to no gain.

So if you're willing to get over the hump that this idea of self-sabotage is literally insane, we can start acknowledging that we literally just don't know.  You and I weren't there on set.  We weren't in the writers room.  We weren't present for literally 99.999999999999% of the hours spent putting this thing together.  And that .000000000001% that we were, is that sliver of behind the scenes footage that is carefully curated to not damn the show or its creator.  There's no point in pontificating the why's because we're just never going to know until like 10 years from now when they do some off-the-cuff interview and explain what happened but until then, you're just theorizing on something you have little to no data on, so its pointless.  But close to the last thing you should be thinking is that they *actually* sabotaged the show.  The bad decisions that *seem* like sabotage are more likely the result of trying to subvert expectations and trying to zig when the audience thinks your going to zag and very poor planning.  Again, I think if they gave themselves more time, more resources and slowed down, it'd be very different.  They would have criticized their own work and realized how awful it was.  I mean, the greatest evidence of that is the pilot back in season 1.  They literally talk at lengths about how awful the pilot was and how they recut it and made a ton of changes before it aired.  So its entirely possible they made the same mistakes with this final season and perhaps if they had the time nad resources to take a second look at it and look at the final product, and make changes.  

Again, you just don't get how intimidating a blank page is.  Literally anything is possible.  It can be daunting with something the scale as Game of Thrones because once you start, you end up locking yourself in, especially when your production budget is as big as it is or if you've spent resources flying your cast and crew out to some remote location and now you have some footage you're committed to, whether you want to change it later or not.  The blank page aspect is scary because there's no guides.  Its so easy to sit back and watch a season of a show and have all the pieces in front of you and say ""well i wouldn't have made that decision"" but when none of that exists and someone asks you to make it up on a blank page, it becomes scary.  And to be clear, I'm not excusing season 8 and I'm not excusing their actions but if you're a rationale human-being and you don't assume these guys were mustache twirling villains that wanted to piss the entire world off, the most *likely* scenario is that they were overworked, they made bad mistakes, they rushed it out and it wasn't malicious, it was just *bad*.

I'm not saying it's dying tomorrow, but the industry decline is hovering around 20% year over year.

If it's not entertaining or creatively conceived it doesn't 'cut through the noise'.        

As these promos are getting more creative and 'entertaining', the companies now have to spend more to develop &amp; shoot them.   If they spend that money for content creation, the next step is to spend more on media placements that control when, where, and how they're seen.  Bang for your buck.

With big data - networks and sponsors can see when viewership drops off, usually after Act 2, and usually after the first ad in every break.  That means that sponsors want to ensure primary placement not only within programming, but also within ad breaks to ensure optimal impressions.

The issues you're facing are part and parcel of the shift in this industry.

[],ViskerRatio,,,[],,,,text,t2_iugup,False,,"&gt; I don’t have a source for that but it’s obvious that gas mileage has increased in a large way.

Actually, it *hasn't* increased in a big way.

Take a look at the chart here: https://www.mpgomatic.com/2007/11/04/toyota-corolla-gas-mileage/

That's 30+ years of mpg data on the Toyota Corolla (which would have been considered a small, fuel efficient car back in 1979). You'll notice that while it fluctuates back and forth, it hasn't actually gotten any better. It has roughly the same performance now as it did back then.

It might help to recognize that automobile engines were already a fairly mature technology back in the 70s. There's only so much energy you can extract from gasoline, so there never was much potential upside for efficiency.

CAFE standards did lead to the creation of the SUV category and they're responsible for significant money transfers from certain automakers to other automakers. While the average mpg across all cars operated in the U.S. has steadily increased over time, a large part of this effect is simply that older, low efficiency cars have been removed from the mix.

&gt; Companies have to be incentivized to pay that hidden cost and we have to figure out those incentives.

When the chemical plant upstream is killing your lawn, you charge the chemical company a fee to fix your lawn. That makes sense.

However, that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about globalized industries producing goods/services for globalized consumers that have a universal side effect. Everyone both benefits and bears the costs, so there's no externality to address.

Now, you can potentially create punitive conditions that incentivize more efficiency. However, as I noted, the normal response to such conditions is to simply outsource the pollution. It's a lot easier to move a plant to Malaysia and ship the products back than it is to meet onerous regulatory compliance costs.

Likewise, you can potentially spend money to spur development. However, the track record here has been abysmal as well. When you look at targeted solutions for the problem, they have marginal effects at best (and, indeed, as I've noted elsewhere, often counter-intuitively negative effects).

so this is the old/traditional method with networks: ""We canceled Show X after 3 seasons because its ratings were &amp; falling further."" And everyone understands how that works; the networks pay money to air and/or produce shows, then make their money back (and hopefully more) by selling ad space. And how much they can get for the ad space depends on the ratings, which get reported out publicly and quickly e.g. through Nielsen or Arbitron. And if someone's a huge fan of Show X, they can gnash their teeth about the cancellation, but they'll understand that their private passion for Show X isn't enough to move the ratings needle &amp; save their beloved show.

By contrast this is the new/streaming service model: ""We cancelled Show Y after 3 seasons because, reasons.""

,closingbell,,,[],,,,text,t2_401ol,False,,"Netflix Inc. NFLX -1.40% may soon have to contemplate life without its No. 1 show. It’s “The Office.”

NBCUniversal, which owns the show, licensed reruns of the comedy to the streaming-video giant years ago. Now NBCUniversal is launching its own streaming service, and has begun internal discussions about removing “The Office” from Netflix when the contract expires in 2021, according to people familiar with the situation.

This is about to become a recurring headache for Netflix.

Three of its biggest programming suppliers—AT&amp;T Inc.’s WarnerMedia and Walt Disney Co. in addition to Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal—are entering the streaming-video arena. After licensing content to Netflix for years, happy to cash its checks, they are looking to take their hit content back to feed their own platforms.

Netflix has an air of invincibility in the entertainment world, with a huge audience, a hefty war chest and a sizzling stock. But the moves by its Hollywood rivals are a gathering threat, raising the prospect the service could lose some of its most-watched programming or have to pay a steep price to keep it.

The three companies launching new streaming services have created TV shows and movies that make up nearly 40% of the viewing minutes on Netflix, according to data compiled and analyzed for The Wall Street Journal by Nielsen.

Although Netflix has burnished its brand with a flood of original programs such as “Stranger Things” and “The Crown”—and spends most of its time on quarterly earnings calls discussing that content—nonoriginal “library programming” made up 72% of the minutes people spent watching Netflix as of October, according to the Nielsen data. That means reruns, and most of them are made by Netflix’s rivals.

Eight of the 10 shows people spent the most time watching on Netflix in the U.S. last year were reruns, including old hits such as NBCUniversal’s “Parks and Recreation,” WarnerMedia’s “Friends” and Disney’s “Grey’s Anatomy,” the data show.

Netflix discloses little information about its viewership. A Netflix spokesman said the company doesn’t comment on third-party data.

In an earnings call last week, Chief Executive Reed Hastings said the company has long expected to lose some of its library content and is “ready for it, anticipating it, and in fact we are eager to have more and more of our money to be able to do spectacular new titles.”

Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on the same call that Netflix originals are “the shows that our members most value us for, and the things that we really pay a lot of attention to.” He added that the amount of time subscribers spend watching original programming continues to grow.

Still, the next phase of growth for Netflix will likely be more challenging, producing more pressure to develop original hits. In some cases, Netflix might have to relax its traditional insistence on acquiring exclusive streaming rights for classic shows, say industry executives.

“There are a select number of properties that are so meaningful that they will cause someone to revisit that position,” WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey said in an interview earlier this year.

It cost Netflix $100 million to keep reruns of “Friends” in 2019, roughly three times the fee it had been paying, people familiar with the terms of the deal said. After WarnerMedia launches its streaming service, it can take the sitcom back if it chooses, or offer to share it with Netflix.

Netflix will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to share shows, Mr. Sarandos said in a recent interview.

The company, with nearly 149 million customers, is expected to spend about $12 billion this year on entertainment content, excluding commitments for future outlays. For years it has been pouring resources into originals to be ready for when big studios would stop licensing their wares.

Netflix believes original programming propels sign-ups. It doesn’t drive viewership, however. Of the 10 shows Netflix subscribers spent the most-time watching in the U.S. last year, only two were original: the sci-fi horror drama “Stranger Things” and the crime drama “Ozark,” the Nielsen data show.

Top originals provide a burst of viewing right after new episodes, but blue-chip reruns are more consistent, according to the data Nielsen compiled for the Journal. Viewing of “Stranger Things” zoomed in autumn 2017 when its second season was released, but fell back steeply afterward.

Over a 12-month span ended last July, it was watched for 27.6 billion minutes, the Nielsen data show. Viewers watched “The Office” for 45.8 billion minutes.

Brian Fuhrer, senior vice president of product leadership at Nielsen, said sometimes viewers are overwhelmed by a sea of options. “When you open a drawer and you have all these shirts to wear, but you have this one broken-in comfortable sweatshirt, you tend to grab that,” he said. “That’s what people are doing with programming.”

Meanwhile, younger viewers who never saw old shows such as “The Office” on regular television treat them like new programming.

Marta Kauffman, co-creator of “Friends,” the sitcom about six young Manhattanites that went off the air 15 years ago, said it was a “glorious surprise to me that the show has lasted and has this whole new other life.” She attributed its endurance to its heart-warming tone: “It’s not dark, it’s not twisted, it’s not about corrupt people. It’s comfort food.”

Part of the advantage of older shows is their sheer tonnage. There are 235 episodes of “Friends” to choose from.

“Even if you were a passionate fan, you probably have one hundred episodes you missed,” said David Poltrack, chief research officer of CBS Corp. , which also licenses shows to Netflix.

Media executives have been threatening for several years to remove programming from Netflix or otherwise restrict how they license it. The money was too good, so they were slow to act. Some shifted licensing deals to Netflix’s chief rivals, Amazon.com Inc. and Hulu, to avoid relying on a single player for rerun sales.

Now the landscape has changed. The traditional TV business is declining as consumers cut the pay-television cord in ever-greater numbers. The biggest companies are betting their futures on selling online subscriptions to consumers just like Netflix. To do that they can’t keep licensing their content elsewhere, although contracts mean they also can’t remove it in one fell swoop.

Meanwhile, the media companies will face Netflix-like dilemmas of their own, to some degree, since they all source outside programming as well. AT&amp;T’s HBO relies heavily on movies from Comcast’s Universal Studios and Disney’s 20th Century Fox, for example.

Media companies face risks in pulling content from Netflix. If they pass up the licensing revenue and their own streaming services don’t gain traction, they could both hurt themselves and alienate the talent who have financial stakes in shows and get a cut of the cash from Netflix.

NBCUniversal has said little about its planned streaming service. Reruns of many shows the company produces are on Netflix, including the afterlife sitcom “The Good Place.”

As it decides which to bring in-house, the major flashpoint will be “The Office,” a comedy about a Pennsylvania company’s hapless employees and bumbling boss, which ran on NBC until 2013. It accounted for nearly 3% of Netflix’s U.S. viewing last year, or some 52 billion minutes.

The show wasn’t an immediate hit on NBC—in fact, it was in danger of being canceled—making its success on Netflix sweeter for the creators.

""Some shows are watched for nostalgia. ‘The Office’ is being watched by their parents and kids. It is resonating so much with the next generation,” said Ben Silverman, a former NBC executive who was an executive producer of the show.

Greg Daniels, who was its lead executive producer or “show runner,” compared it to other eventual hits, such as “Seinfeld” and “Cheers,” that had slow starts. “It’s a character comedy. It only gets better and better the more you learn about the characters,” Mr. Daniels said.

NBCUniversal executives are still debating whether pulling “The Office” from Netflix and forgoing the licensing revenue makes sense, said a person close to the company.

Netflix paid around $100 million for exclusive streaming rights to “The Office” over several years, according to people familiar with the terms. To keep the rights, Netflix would probably have to offer a substantial premium. Some at NBCUniversal have argued the studio should offer to share the show with Netflix and accept slightly discounted payments.

Also up for debate is programming from the CW Network, a joint venture between WarnerMedia and CBS Corp. Netflix pays between $150 million and $200 million annually for the rights to stream reruns of shows including “Riverdale,” “The Flash” and “Black Lightning” soon after they air on the network, according to people familiar with the terms. That deal expires at the end of April.",1556120983,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",elnyezi,True,t3_bgw81f,,True,t3_bgw81f,/r/television/comments/bgw81f/netflix_fights_to_keep_its_most_watched_shows/elnyezi/,1556120993.0,1,True,,False,television,t5_2qh6e,,,,,1556279132.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, you may get big bumps in premieres and first weeks for shows, but each season that is released has less watchers over the lifetime of a show.

What Netflix (and other streaming services) have done is taken all that data in and made a cutting point for when the number of viewers doesn't justify the price anymore.

,Neo2199,,,[],,,,text,t2_cyqdz,False,,"* For decades, the success of a TV series had been measured by its longevity. The standard series regular contracts are for six years, which has been considered a threshold for a show to be deemed reasonably successful. Netflix may be rewriting the rulebook with a business model that involves shows often running for two to three seasons.

* The Internet network also is assuring its series will remain Netflix exclusives even after their cancellation, with a moratorium allegedly built into deals that prevents axed shows from moving to a new home. That is despite the streamer readily taking in series canceled elsewhere, like Lucifer and Designated Survivor.

* I hear there is **a standard clause in the deals for Netflix series from outside studios that prevents the shows from airing elsewhere for a significant period of time, said to be 2-3 years, making a continuation on another network/platform virtually impossible**. That is probably why we haven’t seen CBS TV Studios’ comedy American Vandal — a breakout hit for Netflix when it launched but canceled in October after two seasons — move to CBS All Access.

* Netflix’s deals include bump/bonuses after each season that are getting progressively bigger. White the payments are relatively modest after Season 1 and a little bigger after Season 2, I hear they escalate after Season 3, especially for series owned by Netflix — sometimes from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars — as the studio starts to pay off the shows’ back-end.


* Netflix is unabashedly data driven, with many of its decisions based on algorithms. **That’s how the network reportedly switched from the initial (and traditional) 13-episode seasons to seasons of 10 episodes or less.** Word is that those shorter seasons are considered optimal for consumption, and any additional episodes beyond 10 a season do not add value, so they are an unnecessary expense for the network.

Of the ten films nominated for best picture in 2016, eight were over two hours long. And even the longest movies don't approach the runtime of classical epics before 1965.

&gt; For reference, here's a look at the length of the ten best picture nominees for 2016:

""The Big Short"" - 130 mins
""Bridge of Spies"" - 142 mins
""Brooklyn"" - 112 mins
""Mad Max: Fury Road"" - 120 mins
""The Martian"" - 144 mins
""The Revenant"" - 156 mins
""Room"" - 118 mins
""Spotlight"" - 129 mins

The conclusion that the average film length is 90-120 minutes comes when only selecting the top 25 most popular films since 1931 but not films. When all films are analyzed, then average comes to around 81 minutes.

The reason that they have become like this is because the focus for antitrust for the last few decades has been impact on the consumer. Did the consumer suffer? Ironically, we're reliving the end of the Rockefeller years. Buy everything, and undercut whatever you can't buy until it's dead. This process has been slow, and for a while (during the undercutting/ consolidation phase) we received cheap services. Youtube with free content and almost no ads, truly unlimited data with phones, and so on. There were a lot of perks. Slowly things have also changed for the worse. Every media company suddenly has a paid service. Companies routinely pull their movies off of Netflix now so that they can make their own version.

,Chicken2nite,,,[],,,,text,t2_4hsah,False,,"I really think they're toning down the advertising for returning shows in general.  If I strain my brain, I can remember paid ads for the last season of House of Cards and probably seasons two for both Stranger Things and GLOW, but otherwise for the last year I've only been seeing promoted ads for new shows and movies from Netflix.

Over the past year on Facebook, I saw ads for Outlaw King, Kurt Russell's Christmas movie, Sabrina, Maniac, Titans, and probably a few other originals, but House of Cards is probably the only returning show that I remember seeing.

I think this is driven by a few different reasons, none of which are inherently wrong, even if it might backfire.  

I think they might be trying to allow for fans to evangelize about their favorite shows coming back as driving people to watch rather than them making it more astroturf than grassroots, and part of that might also be driven by a desire for clean data not tainted by their own advertising to see what the natural demand is for the shows so they can use that as a metric for how much people want to see it.

Because they're spending so much on content and coming out with new shows so often, they might figure they're better off focusing on those new shows to increase awareness of them and make sure that each impression they're paying for is towards something that the viewer likely didn't already form an opinion on elsewhere.

I'm not sure whether we can really say how big of a consistent hit that Daredevil and the other Netflix shows was because Netflix doesn't release much in the way of data.  The best we have from third party analytics has to do with whether people were watching a show that week and whether they were talking about it on social media.

,Rather_Unfortunate,,,[],,,,text,t2_i8fh0,False,,"Many of the Star Trek episodes that people remember are the ones that make pointed, often clumsy commentary about controversial social issues of their day. TOS made a big thing of racial issues at a time when people got violently angry about things like desegregation, including of course the first interracial kiss.

Indeed, the very fact that the bridge crew was multiethnic was a massive thing back then. A Russian, a Japanese man and a black woman, all in positions of respect, all on equal footing (as people, if not in rank). It was very deliberately provocative.

TNG featured lots of social commentary. It talked about climate change in possibly its best episode, The Inner Light, and the ruinous effects of unfettered capitalism and religion in others. But more pertinently to your grievances here, it featured an episode that refers to gay conversion therapy, showing the immorality of such a thing (even if it did really work, unlike its real world counterpart). It also would have featured an openly gay member of the bridge crew, but the studio intervened because it was still the '80s. The episode where Data has a child features nods towards concepts of gender identity, and the script was changed slightly by Whoopi Goldberg to make it more LGBT friendly.

DS9 features one of the first female-female kisses on television and shows characters baffled at why it's not totally fine for them to be together (an alien taboo, rather than a taboo against LGBT relationships). It also features another episode where two unambiguously female characters are in a relationship, kissing on-screen.

No, not every episode was about something like that. But making deliberate, progressive social commentary by allegory is just about the most Trek thing to ever Trek in Trek.

In that case they'll work with you to see what is reasonable to find, ""Three beds and a garage is going to be tricky.  We might find that in another town, though two beds and a garage or three beds is reasonable.""

In parallel you'll get pre-approved for a mortgage if you need one.  This is a bank saying ""If what you told me is true I'll give you a loan.""

When you find a place you put in an offer as well as some earnest money (term may be a bit off).  This is a small piece, usually a couple hundred, that goes towards your down payment.  Your offer depends on a lot of terms, and is where a realtor can help if it's not a standard transaction.  Usually you have a series of ""outs"" such as ""house has to pass inspection, my loan has to be approved, and I need a buyer for my current place."". If any of those fail you get your money back, if you fail to do what's needed from you they keep that money.

Once that's all squared away you get the bank to approve your loan.  Usually that's just them running a credit report and taking documentation about your income.  They'll usually do an appraisal on the house, and you'll have an appraisal clause in your offer.  That's just to ensure you don't spend $250k on a place that's worth $175k.  Appraisals are no big deal as if the house comes in under you just go back to the seller and say ""hey, appraisal came in at X, I can't get a mortgage at Y price, but I'll be happy to buy it at X.""

Next comes the purchase and sale agreement and more money into escrow.  The P&amp;S is the contract that details specifically what you're buying and sets a date for the actual sale.  It's a terribly boring document full of legalize.

On the sale day you meet at a town building, mine was the registry of deeds, with your lawyers.  You spend about 15 minutes signing a ton of documents, the lawyers leave to file the paperwork, and you get a set of keys to your new home.

That's how it worked in my state (MA).  Might change slightly depending on your state but I've been told it's about the same everywhere in the US.

Oh, and around the time you finalize your mortgage you setup insurance.  They usually work with your mortgage provider so that the cost is added to your mortgage and the bank pays the mortgage company.  Bit of a win-win as you only need to pay one bill and the bank requires you to keep a certain amount of coverage to keep your loan (if something happens and the place is lost they want to make sure they still get paid).",1569797285,{},f1xeio0,False,t3_dau1vp,False,True,t1_f1wcbhy,/r/television/comments/dau1vp/for_20_years_house_hunters_has_been_reliable/f1xeio0/,1569807440.0,2,True,[],False,television,t5_2qh6e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],farmerwouldsay,,,[],,,,text,t2_fdwwy,False,,"There is no national clearinghouse for cases of infant hyperthermia, no government agency charged with data collection and oversight. The closest thing is in the basement office of a comfortable home in suburban Kansas City, Kan., where a former sales and marketing executive named Janette Fennell runs a nonprofit organization called Kids and Cars. Kids and Cars lobbies for increased car safety for children, and as such maintains one of the saddest databases in America.
Fennell is on a sofa, her bare feet tucked under her, leafing through files. Amber, her college intern, walks up and plops a fax of a new wire service story on the table. “Frontover,” Amber says. “Parking lot, North Carolina.”
There’s a grisly terminology to this business. “Backovers” happen when you look in the rearview mirror and fail to see the child behind the car, or never look at all. “Frontovers” occur almost exclusively with pickups and SUVs, where the driver sits high off the ground. There are “power window strangulations” and “cars put in motion by child” and, finally, “hyperthermia.”
In a collage on Fennell’s wall are snapshots of dozens of infants and toddlers, some proudly holding up fingers, as if saying, “I’m 2!” Or “I’m 3!” The photos, typically, are from their final birthdays.
Fennell has met or talked with many of the parents in the hyperthermia cases, and some now work with her organization. She doesn’t seek them out. They find her name, often late at night, sleeplessly searching the Web for some sign that there are others who have lived in the same hell and survived. There is a general misconception, Fennell says, about who these people are: “They tend to be the doting parents, the kind who buy baby locks and safety gates.” These cases, she says, are failures of memory, not of love.
Fennell has an expression that’s half smile, half wince. She uses it often.
“Some people think, ‘Okay, I can see forgetting a child for two minutes, but not eight hours.’ What they don’t understand is that the parent in his or her mind has dropped off the baby at day care and thinks the baby is happy and well taken care of. Once that’s in your brain, there is no reason to worry or check on the baby for the rest of the day.”
Fennell believes that prosecuting parents in this type of case is both cruel and pointless: It’s not as though the fear of a prison sentence is what will keep a parent from doing this.
The answer to the problem, Fennell believes, lies in improved car safety features and in increased public awareness that this can happen, that the results of a momentary lapse of memory can be horrifying.
What is the worst case she knows of?
“I don’t really like to . . .” she says.
She looks away. She won’t hold eye contact for this.
“The child pulled all her hair out before she died.”
For years, Fennell has been lobbying for a law requiring back-seat sensors in new cars, sensors that would sound an alarm if a child’s weight remained in the seat after the ignition is turned off. Last year, she almost succeeded. The 2008 Cameron Gulbransen Kids’ Transportation Safety Act -- which requires safety improvements in power windows and in rear visibility, and protections against a child accidentally setting a car in motion -- originally had a rear seat-sensor requirement, too. It never made the final bill; sponsors withdrew it, fearing they couldn’t get it past a powerful auto manufacturers’ lobby.
There are a few aftermarket products that alert a parent if a child remains in a car that has been turned off. These products are not huge sellers. They have likely run up against the same marketing problem that confronted three NASA engineers a few years ago.
In 2000, Chris Edwards, Terry Mack and Edward Modlin began to work on just such a product after one of their colleagues, Kevin Shelton, accidentally left his 9-month-old son to die in the parking lot of NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The inventors patented a device with weight sensors and a keychain alarm. Based on aerospace technology, it was easy to use; it was relatively cheap, and it worked.
Janette Fennell had high hopes for this product: The dramatic narrative behind it, she felt, and the fact that it came from NASA, created a likelihood of widespread publicity and public acceptance.
That was five years ago. The device still isn’t on the shelves. The inventors could not find a commercial partner willing to manufacture it. One big problem was liability. If you made it, you could face enormous lawsuits if it malfunctioned and a child died. But another big problem was psychological: Marketing studies suggested it wouldn’t sell well.
The problem is this simple: People think this could never happen to them.

“I was that guy, before. I’d read the stories, and I’d go, ‘What were those parents thinking?’ “
Mikey Terry is a contractor from Maypearl, Tex., a big man with soft eyes. At the moment he realized what he’d done, he was in the cab of a truck and his 6-month-old daughter, Mika, was in a closed vehicle in the broiling Texas sun in a parking lot 40 miles away. So his frantic sprint to the car was conducted at 100 miles an hour in a 30-foot gooseneck trailer hauling thousands of pounds of lumber the size of telephone poles.
On that day in June 2005, Terry had been recently laid off, and he’d taken a day job building a wall in the auditorium of a Catholic church just outside of town. He’d remembered to drop his older daughter at day care, but as he was driving the baby to a different day care location, he got a call about a new permanent job. This really caught his attention. It was a fatal distraction.
Terry, 35, wasn’t charged with a crime. His punishment has been more subtle.
The Terrys are Southern Baptists. Before Mika’s death, Mikey Terry says, church used to be every Sunday, all day Sunday, morning Bible study through evening meal. He and his wife, Michele, don’t go much anymore. It’s too confusing, he says.
“I feel guilty about everyone in church talking about how blessed we all are. I don’t feel blessed anymore. I feel I have been wronged by God. And that I have wronged God. And I don’t know how to deal with that.”

The fact that it isn't 100% now goes to show there is no strong substitution effect in situations where an equivalent substitute isn't available. Likewise, there is no equivalent substitute for guns to provide a strong substitute effect for gun homicides in the event of a ban. 

The closest substitutes are knives in terms of availability, but they're far less lethal, or homemade bombs and guns in terms of lethality, but they're far less available or practical. Car attacks might come closest to guns in both categories, but they're easier to mitigate in areas that are anticipated to be crowded, and they're almost useless for criminals. So no matter what, the lack of a close substitute moderates the substitution effect and reduces overall violence by reducing overall access to lethality. 

I'm not ignoring other factors. I promise I've thought about them before we ever talked. It's simply that there are no factors that I see that could possibly explain anywhere close to the 40x, 4,000% difference in frequency between defensive homicides by firearm and criminal homicides by firearm except that criminals are far more advantaged by the wide availability of firearms due to the frequent strong-arm nature of crime.

Those football deaths are worthy of consideration but there's a big difference between 10 deaths a year due to direct injuries from playing football and 10,000 deaths caused by guns violence. Just because defining a single number for acceptable deaths is arbitrary, that doesn't mean that large difference in deaths is also arbitrary. As an analogy, 17 vs 18 for voting age is kind of an arbitrary line, but just because it no single objective inflection point can be identified between their ages, that doesn't mean 4 vs 54 is an arbitrary age difference in deciding which of two people can vote. 10 deaths versus 10,000 deaths remains a similarly meaningful difference.

Football is also different because efforts are continuously made and adopted to increase safety despite the negative effect on enjoyment, all fatalities are limited to volunteer participants (players) and not bystanders, and football lethality can't be weaponized by criminals. These football deaths are quantitatively and qualitatively different than gun deaths.

A hard basis in empirical data is always superior to inference alone and I explained the significance of my choice of data (apples-to-apples, etc.) Tell me why that's wrong if you think I'm making the wrong assumptions. Do you have a theory besides ""kills-prevented"" to share that would explain the huge difference in criminal versus defensive gun homicides, or why that gap isn't representative of the impact of firearms? 

By the way, I've read [the actual CDC paper](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18319/priorities-for-research-to-reduce-the-threat-of-firearm-related-violence) your link talks about. The numbers it provides are just a summary of existing studies and surveys performed by others. It's not a reference to CDC research and the low estimates given for total defensive uses are [actually only 60,000,](https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3?term=defensive#45) not 300,000.

Australia alone doesn't demonstrate the effect of gun control well because they already had relatively low levels of violence and gun ownership and the initial buybacks and bans were slow and modest. Like I said, the effect is clear in aggregate. I only used first world EU countries for total homicides because it was easy to find and because we can both agree the general rate of gun ownership is lower in the EU than in the US. My chart shows the general rate of homicide there is lower than in the US as well. I accept and acknowledge that's not a clear and detailed regression like my first image relating to firearm homicides. If you have one handy please link it. 

But like I said, what other factors explain the difference if not lax gun laws? I bet you none of them correlate nearly as strongly as ease of gun availability. But like with our substitution debate, it's not incumbent on me to recognize other relevant factors. My conclusion is based on already eliminating them as a possibility. If you have something you think is explanatory that I missed then you are going to have to provide it. 

Can you rephrase what you mean in the last bit about cars? I'm not getting it yet. My point was that the regulation of cars is tougher than guns because of how those regulations relate to the actual use of cars compared to how gun regulations relate to their use. In real terms, it's undeniable that there are thousands of people (let alone millions of your hypothetical 14 year olds) who have never been able to have normal access to cars because they can't get their license or pay for insurance as mandated by law.

What we agree on:

There are too many guns, there is unlikely to be some form of ban on them. There especially wont be anything resembling Australia's ban. 

The solution is America is very very unlikely to be banning guns. There may not be a 'solution' at all.

Just because two things seem to coincide, doesnt necessarily mean they actually do (Australia having a reduction in shootings while banning guns; America having reduced crime while increasing the amount of guns)

Australia and America are very different, its extremely hard to draw definite conclusions from them. Just because a gun ban worked in Aus doesnt mean it will in America.

Politicians dont necessarily represent our thoughts, nor does any political movement. I will not lump you in with Reddits garbage view of Trump, thats not fair to you as an individual.

I dont have a definitive solution to the gun problem and I dont claim to. 

What we disagree on:

Your initial source being bad (if you actually go back to my first reply, thats all it was saying. Simply pointing out that an article that says 2 shootings have occured since 1996 doesnt support your claim very well.)

That I think we should ban guns in America (I dont know where you got this idea from??? from my second reply I am clearly saying that it wont work in America like it did in Australia)

That, fundamentally, having no guns is better than arming everyone. But, like, thats just a general belief my guy. Please, for the love of god, dont interpret this as me saying we should ban guns in America... this is a belief, not a thing that we should apply everywhere. Its really no longer applicable to America.

So, to break it down for you even further;

To many guns, ban will never happen (big thing you talked about that we actually agree on)

There may not be a reasonable solution other than continuing down the current path of arming everything (You really think I disagree with you here, I dont.)

America != Australia. (Ive never claimed it, nor have you. We both agree that data from Australia doesnt necessarily apply to America.)

Politicians != me or you (you really tried to lump me in with a group before and tried to assume what I think based on that group. Please dont do that :)) 

Idk how to fix any of these problems (and thats not a bad thing to admit. You keep asking how Id carry out the ban when I have clearly said, multiple times, I dont think a ban is the right way to do it if anyway at all.)

No guns &gt; lots of guns (the actual thing we disagree on)

Initial source = bad (the initial thing we disagree on)

Beyond that, we havent actually talked about much.

Go back and read your own damn reply where you say that the insult is bad. It was intended to be bad, because its not really an insult. I will not take your internet words personally, you may say anything, and I think its weird that youre taking everything I say personally, but thats up to you, my friend.

[],kamikazecow,,,[],,,,text,t2_4sdgj,False,,"&gt;Unfortunately the UCR data do not distinguish between
burglaries to occupied versus unoccupied homes, and thus cannot support a separate analysis of
hot burglaries. 

Seems like an important sentence to leave out. 

&gt;Almost all of these
reports (98.9 %) indicated that the intruder had been scared off (in defensive use).

&gt;For example, in one 1982 convenience sample of 1,823 state
prisoners, 35 percent of respondents “strongly agreed” and 39 percent “agreed” that “one reason
burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot.”

So most burglaries probably happen when no one is home, since the mere sight or sound of a firearm kept intruders out. If you're interested in personal safety, having a firearm will be incredibly helpful. So long as you have a good insurance policy your property will be protected too. 

&gt;Another respondent in the same study expressed a preference for
working in neighborhoods with high proportions of white residents since households in these
areas are likely to have “the basics,” include guns

So being in a nicer neighborhood has a higher incentive to rob, and those neighborhoods tend to have more guns. They're after money, whether it be jewelry or firearms. That seems to point to a pretty big omitted variable bias, in that their targets are nicer homes which also tend to carry firearms. It would be great to find a study that used both data points.

&gt;The issue of reverse causation is also addressed by use of “instrumental variables” (IV)
estimates. The specific instrument employed in these estimates is the percentage of the state
population living in rural areas in 1950, an indicator of rural tradition in the state to which gun
ownership is closely tied. The resulting estimates are compatible with the ordinary-least-squares
estimates in suggesting a non-negative relationship between gun density and burglary rate


Due to the endogenous behavior of the variables observed it makes sense to use two staged regression analysis.  However using population data from the percent of rural population in the 1950s as the z variable seems highly suspect, especially with the significantly changing trend to urbanization.

[],__prison__mike__,,,[],,,,text,t2_1up0jwxr,False,,"The United Automobile Workers union went on strike at General Motors, sending nearly 50,000 members at factories across the Midwest and South to picket lines on Monday morning.

With the two sides far apart, U.A.W. regional leaders in Detroit voted unanimously on Sunday morning to authorize the strike, the union’s first such walkout since 2007. It began at midnight, after the union’s current bargaining agreement expired on Saturday.

“Today, we stand strong and say with one voice, we are standing up for our members and for the fundamental rights of working-class people in this nation,” Terry Dittes, a union vice president, said after the meeting.

The U.A.W. is pushing G.M. to improve wages, reopen idled plants, add jobs at others and close or narrow the difference between pay rates for new hires and veteran workers. G.M. wants employees to pay a greater portion of their health care costs, and to increase work force productivity and flexibility in factories.

Although the company has been earning substantial profits in North America — and it made $8.1 billion globally last year — it has idled three plants in the United States as car sales slide and overall demand for vehicles weakens.

The strike is unfolding as President Trump’s trade war with China wears on manufacturers and has stirred fears of a slowdown.

It could disrupt local economies in factory towns in several swing states like Michigan and Ohio, where President Trump has promised to increase manufacturing jobs. But any impact on the broader economy will depend on how long it lasts.

The auto industry, even if it is far from its employment heights in the 1970s, remains crucial to the economy, counting some 220,000 people who work to manufacture cars. According to the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, the broader vehicle industry supports 9.9 million jobs and historically accounts for about 3 percent of gross domestic product.

Even as the unionized share of the nation’s work force continues to fall, down from a peak of one-third in the 1950s, labor has become more assertive in recent years.

The number of people who participated in work stoppages involving over 1,000 workers rose last year to its highest level since the 1980s, buoyed by teacher walkouts and a multicity hotel workers strike.

Polling data shows that the public has become increasingly supportive of organized labor. A Gallup poll in late August found that 64 percent of Americans approve of unions, up from below 50 percent a decade ago.

Even so, some have been critical of the labor movement’s ability to capitalize on these trends, and of the U.A.W.’s failures in particular. In June, the union narrowly lost a vote to organize a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee.

And the talks between G.M. and the union have been shadowed by a federal corruption inquiry that has been looking into U.A.W. officials and at least two Fiat Chrysler company executives. The investigation has detailed the use of union funds for lavish travel and personal spending by senior U.A.W. officials, including the president, Gary Jones.

In a statement, G.M. said it had offered to make more than $7 billion in new investments in plants in the United States, add 5,400 jobs and increase pay and benefits.

“We presented a strong offer that improves wages, benefits and grows U.S. jobs in substantive ways, and it is disappointing that the U.A.W. leadership has chosen to strike at midnight tonight,” the company said on Sunday. “We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency. Our goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business.”

It is a challenging time for the industry over all, with auto sales slowing in the United States, China and other major markets, and new technologies such as electric cars and self-driving vehicles requiring billions of dollars in investments.

“Carmakers’ profits today distract from two challenges,” said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows the auto industry. “The makers will be going into a down cycle of demand in their two most important markets and they will have to make the biggest technology investments in their history to change to electric propulsion.”

One of the union’s aims is getting G.M. to reopen an idled car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, a goal that President Trump has endorsed. The plant had made the Chevrolet Cruze, a compact car whose sales plunged nearly 40 percent between 2015, when the previous labor contract was signed, and 2018. The factory ceased production in March.

A person with knowledge of the talks said G.M. was reluctant to reopen the Lordstown plant, but it was willing to discuss building a new battery factory in that area of Ohio as it shifts to electric vehicles.

G.M. has also expressed willingness to keep open a car plant in Detroit that had been targeted for closure, this person said.

The strike will immediately halt production in the United States, and a prolonged stoppage could affect G.M.’s Canadian and Mexican operations, crimping its bottom line and the fortunes of thousands of its parts suppliers.

G.M. operates 12 vehicle assembly factories in the United States and 22 parts plants. Workers at 12 parts distribution centers and two engineering locations are also represented by the U.A.W. Just under half of G.M.’s unionized locations are in Michigan. The rest are in six other states: Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and New York.

The company has enough inventory on dealer lots to last 77 days at the current rate of sales, according to Cox Automotive.

A long shutdown could prove painful for union members, who would have to get by on strike pay of $250 a week while out of work. Any hit to G.M.’s North American profits would also lower the annual profit-sharing checks union members receive each March. Those checks have averaged $11,000 over the last three years.

“Workers will feel it immediately because if they move to strike pay, that’s miserable,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.

The union may also be wary of depleting its strike fund. It is delaying talks with Ford and Fiat Chrysler while focusing on G.M., a standard practice in the every-four-year talks between the U.A.W. and the Detroit automakers.

The auto industry has been transformed over the last 30 years as foreign automakers have built their own nonunion factories in the United States employing tens of thousands, and taken market share from Detroit’s Big Three.

The U.A.W. did not resort to nationwide strikes against G.M. when it negotiated contracts in 2011 and 2015. Its members — it had 73,000 at G.M. at the time — walked out of General Motors plants for three days in 2007 before a deal was reached, as a recession loomed. The company lost $23 million in 2007.

G.M. has bounced back after its 2009 bankruptcy and government bailout and now employs 49,000 full-time and temporary U.A.W. members. G.M. has a smaller U.A.W. work force than its Detroit rivals because larger portions of the vehicles it makes in North America are assembled in Mexico and Canada.

While the prospect of a strike has temporarily taken the spotlight off the union’s legal troubles, the scandal has made members suspicious of the U.A.W. leadership, said Paul Wohlfarth, a retired U.A.W. member from Toledo who is still active in the union.

“It seemed like a few bad apples at first, but it’s not,” he said. “It’s a whole bushel.”

Since 2017, nine people have been charged in connection with a variety of schemes in which union money was allegedly used for extravagant personal spending. In one case, Fiat Chrysler’s top labor executive bought a Ferrari sports car and renovated his home using funds earmarked for a training center run by the union and the automaker.

Late last month, federal agents raided Mr. Jones’s home in Canton, Mich.; a Hazelwood, Mo., regional office that Mr. Jones previously headed; the union’s Black Lake retreat in Onaway, Mich.; and the Corona, Calif., home of Mr. Jones’s predecessor, Dennis Williams.

On Thursday, Vance Pearson, a senior union official who worked closely with Mr. Jones, was charged with embezzlement, money laundering, wire fraud, conspiracy and other offenses. The prosecutor’s complaint said Mr. Pearson and other senior U.A.W. officials spent union funds on luxury villas in Palm Springs, Calif., golf clubs, clothing, expensive champagne, liquors and cigars.

This could make several points difference with my peeps. My southern baptist peeps woudl draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.”   


in response to the above e-mail,  Amy Dacey, CEO of the DNC responded with: ""AMEN""

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, in multiple e-mails between DNC colleagues, stated that  Jeff Weaver, Sanders' Campaign manager was ""a damn lair"" and ""an ass""   


DNC National Secretary Mark Paustenbach wrote to National Communications Director Luis Miranda on May 21 the following:  
""Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess?""  


Miranda responded with:

""True. But the chair has been advised not to engage. So we'll have to leave it alone.""   


In April, Wasserman Schultz responded to an e-mail she received on April 24 with an article describing the ways Sanders felt the DNC was undermining his campaign. 

She wrote: ""Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.""   


Oh, and then there's the 2015 memo from the Hillary Campaign where she basically signs a contract with the DNC that she will transfer money from her campaign directly to the DNC if they nominate her in 2016:  
 

""This Memorandum is intended to memorialize our agreement regarding the creation and operation of Hillary Victory Fund (Victory Fund), a joint fundraising committee of Hillary for America (HFA) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

""HFA is prepared to raise and invest funds into the DNC via the Victory. In return for this financial support, HFA requires the appropriate influence over the financial, strategic, and operational use of these JFA-raised funds.

""Commencing on September 1, 2015 HFA agrees to raise funds for the Victory Fund sufficient to fund the DNC's data, technology, analytics, research, and communications operations. Specifically, HFA will agree to raise and to instruct the Victory Fund Treasurer, Beth Jones (who is employed by HFA) to transfer from the Victory Fund a minimum of one million and two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000.00) to the DNC from its share of the net proceeds under the allocation formula on the first day of every month (beginning October 1, 2015) for these activities (the ""Base Amount""). In the event that the Victory Fund is not in possession of adequate net proceeds allocable to the DNC on the first of the month to make such transfer, it shall make the required transfer as soon as adequate funds are available.

""HFA's obligations under this agreement, and the release of the Base Amounts each month are conditioned on the following:

1. With respect to the hiring of a DNC Communications Director, the DNC agrees that no later than September 11, 2015 it will hire one of two candidates previously identified as acceptable to HFA.
2. With respect to the hiring of future DNC senior staff in the communications, technology, and research departments, in the case of vacancy, the DNC will maintain the authority to make the final decision as between candidates acceptable to HFA.
3. Agreement by the DNC that HFA personnel will be consulted and have joint authority over strategic decisions over the staffing, budget, expenditures, and general election related communications, data, technology, analytics, and research. The DNC will provide HFA advance opportunity to review on-line or mass email, communications that features a particular Democratic primary candidate. This does not include any communications related to primary debates – which will be exclusively controlled by the DNC. The DNC will alert HFA in advance of mailing any direct mail communications that features a particular Democratic primary candidate or his or her signature.
4. If asked by a State Party, the DNC will encourage the State Party to become a participant in the Victory Fund.

""Once HFA has raised the first $1,200,000 and it has been distributed to the DNC, HFA will be granted complete and seamless access to all research work product and tools (not including any research or tracking the DNC may engage in relating to other Democratic candidates).

""The parties also agree that they will enter into an agreed upon voter file licensing agreement. As consideration for that agreement, HFA will raise an additional $250,000 into the Victory Fund that will be distributed to the DNC no later than March 31, 2016.

""In addition, HFA will also raise funds for the Victory Fund that will distributed to the DNC in excess of the $1,200,000 monthly base amount (Excess Amount). The Excess Amount raised by HFA that is distributed to the DNC will be spent on the DNC's data, technology, analytics, research, and communications operations as directed by HFA (Special Projects). Although the DNC will remain responsible for the day to day execution of those Special Projects, HFA will determine (in consultation with the DNC) the Special Project's scope, strategy, staffing, budget, and manner of execution.

""Finally, HFA agrees that on a monthly basis the Victory Fund will provide the DNC a list of receipts and disbursements from the Victory Fund. The DNC agrees to provide monthly financial reports to HFA as it relates to the use of the funds distributed by the Victory Fund to the DNC.

""In the event that there is a disagreement in the operation of this agreement or the use of the Base Amount, the DNC department head and their HFA counterpart will meet and confer to resolve the matter. If that fails to resolve the disagreement, then you and I will resolve it. If there is still no resolution the DNC Chair and the HFA Chair will resolve.

""Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC's obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process. All activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary. Further we understand you may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.

""The attached Joint Fundraising Agreement will be entered into by HFA and the DNC (as well as by State Parties).

""This agreement will be reviewed on March 31, 2016 and either party may terminate any prospective obligation at that time.

""If this memorandum correctly summarizes our agreement, please reply by email with the text – 'Agreed by DNC'.""

1) AMP isn't a requirement for any site. News sites were likely the early adopters because they're text heavy and shifting to AMP is easy. AMP is mostly (not entirely) a standard for web pages. The big thing it does is limit the amount of CSS in a page so it loads faster. Google can't, and wouldn't, require sites to format in a certain way to be listed.

2) Ads don't have to be specifically designed for AMP. AMP supports banner ads, the most basic of all types of online advertising. Any publisher is already capable of supporting AMP advertising if they can run banner ads.

My take on AMP:

I've seen the complaints about it, not the ones you've listed but mostly that publishers see decreased revenue from AMP ads (though some have reported no change). I wouldn't be surprised if their revenues went down, I frankly hate AMP pages and spend way less time on them. But overall it doesn't provide anyone in advertising an advantage or disadvantage, it just makes the page size smaller and the ads supported more basic (something that actually makes more advertisers capable of supplying ads if they have shallower offerings). If the end of this anti-trust suit is that Google has to stop pushing the AMP framework I bet they'd easily agree, the advent of 5g has made AMP a moot point, since it was likely intended to decrease web page size so people could browse more on limited data plans.",1568122000,{},ezt5p4r,False,t3_d1y9pg,False,True,t1_ezt318j,/r/news/comments/d1y9pg/48_us_states_launch_antitrust_investigation_into/ezt5p4r/,1568122002.0,1,True,[],False,news,t5_2qh3l,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In part their reason why their stock keeps going up in value is because investors see their ability to grow and make more money so it's more valuable than say Walmart.

It's true Amazon is the big player now but what about 8 years ago? What has Ebay been doing since 1995? Newegg and Rakuten are the only others that came to mind but they didn't invest in themselves like Amazon did here in the US. It honestly just looks like Amazon made good investments at a good time despite losing money for yeeeears with long term investments into the company. They sacrifice short term growth for long term.

I disagree. Overall trends are all that matters and I weigh the cost of policies with marginal gain in said trends. 


&gt; Joey Stalin may have been fond of saying ""One death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic,"" But that's not the way we roll. For instance, the US has all in all not had much of a problem with mass deaths due to vehicle born bombs, but we still made changes to the purchase of high nitrate fertilizer after OKC, and we've had even less of a problem with people flying planes into buildings,  but post 9/11, we did tweak a thing or two.
&gt;Since gun law changes in Australia in 1996 due to the Port Arthur Massacre, do you know what the highest body count due to a firearm related attack was? 7. Osmington, May 11th, 2018. In 22 years. And just because you'll say ""Well, they'll find another way, yanno..."" the worst massacre since Port Arthur was 15 people, and that was an arson attack. How does that compare to the nightmares that have happened in the US since 1996? But your argument is ""Well, kindergarteners' packed in their classroom like sardines is bad and all, but if you look at the overall trend..."" No. Just. No.

I guess we will just have to agree to disagree because we fundamentally disagree here. I don’t care for statistical outliers because *that’s what they are*. There’s no way you can make random massacres an issue without some sort of emotional appeal.

&gt; Okay, so you'd approach it in a multifaceted way. First, put a moratorium on the manufacture of certain designs of weapons, and their components. and unlike your facetious statement, when it comes to mechanical engineering, legislation can be tailored very, very specifically. Be a bud and read some legislation regarding aircraft design or automotive safety. In the 1980s, the production of all-terrain cycles was banned. They weren't banned or confiscated, but I haven't seen one since after MC Hammer was big.

And that would be unconstitutional right from the getgo. Wouldn’t pass scrutiny. A production ban, is a de facto ban. 

&gt; But to combat methamphetamine, we put restrictions in place regarding bulk pseudoephedrine purchases, and we're are suing the living shit out the makers of Oxycontin who recklessly promoted it. We've enacted legislation regarding advertising of alcohol, but even more so tobacco.

Restrictions in bulk purchases would be unconstitutional and wouldn’t pass any sort of scrutiny. And good thing PLCAA is a thing. Judging from your previous replies, it seems you’d consider *any* promotion of firearms to be “reckless.”

&gt; You could enact legislation that allowed a buyer to to only purchase say 10 rounds of high calibre ammunition from a store every 24 hours. Oh I know, they can go to a different store, but you know what, it'll have an effect. And in the adult world, lessening atrocity is not as good as ending atrocity, but it is better than ignoring atrocity.

Unconstitutional and will be immediately challenged in court, and your personal attack has been noted and dismissed. 


&gt; We could approach the advertising of firearms the same way we did tobacco companies, and honestly, I think this is the where the problem lies. The NRA and gun manufacturers are absolute experts in marketing their product, they are so good at it that they have convinced grown men, like yourself, to willingly, and without any sort of compensation, repeat the advertising points their marketing and PR firms came up with. You do it and you don't even realize it. Every single person like you always has the exact same arguments, phrased the exact same way, that are easily remembered, catchy, and on first glance make sense. That's by design.






It’s that damn pesky Bill of Rights standing in the way again. Sorry man, I just can’t see how every step of the way would pass in congress *and* survive the inevitable court challenge. And what’s with you all wanting to trample all the other amendments because of your hatred of the 2nd? Seems like a common occurrence. 




But do keep making baseless assumptions about me as a person, it holds no water. Where exactly have I repeated “NRA advertising points”? I don’t particularly like the NRA, but on the chance I happened to agree with one of their arguments, calling it a “NRA talking point” is not a refutation of said argument. I hear it all the time, and it’s nothing more than an ad hominem. Everything I’ve said is statistically true and backed up with reason. 



&gt; Now since I know you don't really have an understanding of the subject matter, and you're really just saying ""Just do It"" for large companies, I do not expect any sort of intelligent response, but there's your answer.

Another baseless personal attack. Instead of actually using logical and statistical data to justify, your side uses emotional appeals, underhanded PR tactics, and disingenuous portrayal of data that is borderline propaganda. So I know you all have no case.

It depends on the other person's exact position. If they're stating that it's a fact that we don't have 100% certainty that the Big Bang happened, then that's an argument that can be resolved immediately because that's a true statement - we don't know with 100% certainty. Now, if their position is that they don't *believe* the big bang happened, despite the 99% certainty that empirical evidence gives us, then you're careening into the realm of the philosophical and a traditional argument using facts that anyone can easily find probably isn't going to persuade them anyway.

In this case, the person saying that they don't *believe* the big bang happened still has a tenable position - there's a small percent chance we're entirely wrong about the nature of what happened at the birth of the universe. It's not a very strong position, and one that is unlikely to be correct, but there is still a percentage chance of that person being right.",1567633938,{},ez0agxw,False,t3_czkt7u,False,True,t1_ez03t1j,/r/news/comments/czkt7u/sf_board_of_supervisors_declare_national_rifle/ez0agxw/,1567633970.0,1,True,[],False,news,t5_2qh3l,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's assume there is some position on an issue that is ""correct"" and there is a specific 5 minute argument that proves it, I can then create an arbitrarily more verbose or nuanced argument in favor of that position that takes longer than 5 minutes to espouse. Does the increased time scale to that specific form of the argument now make it incorrect? The time it takes to state a given position is independent of its correctness, and often in real world systems it is not that gut reaction, simplest and easiest to state case that ends up being the valid one. If someone wanted to argue that the big bang never happened, it would take me more than 5 minutes to explain and examine the pertinant empirically gathered data that leads us to believe with near certainty that it happened. Sure I could come up with a quick argument, but it would inherently end up relying on unstated or hidden information that if not included and thus not considered, would make that argument flimsy and not stand up on its own. Someone might have their mind changed and be satisfied with that quick discourse but any poking at that shallow argument would show that it does not logically hold true and needs the additional nuance to actually be a logically consistent view on the topic. Also, that example I gave is for a science topic in which there is one correct answer at the scale of examination, while human social systems and issues like guns and abortion dont have an exact empirical correct answer meaning that you really will need a very nuanced discourse about the topic to make any kind of strong claims one way or another and hopefully then use that strength to pursuade them to change their opinion.",1567630069,{},ez03t1j,False,t3_czkt7u,False,True,t1_eyzu9xj,/r/news/comments/czkt7u/sf_board_of_supervisors_declare_national_rifle/ez03t1j/,1567630071.0,1,True,[],False,news,t5_2qh3l,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then as demand arises they see which people in their concentration camp have the appropriate organs and kill them off without any sort of due process to begin with. And of course people shrug their shoulders, distance themselves from the people being murdered, and think instead about the lives being saved.

Thats why the issue of punishing criminals should be separated from the goal of saving lives; linking the two creates a feedback loop with extremely questionable incentives where the system itself becomes rotten. OTOH, No doctor is ever going to intentionally kill off a patient in a quest to save lives.

Preventing this feedback loop necessitates wasting the organs of the executed. *The whole point of executions is that they should be wasteful and done with great deliberation.* That’s why millions of dollars are spent on appeals and hearings before any execution is performed here in the United States, more money than it costs to imprison them for life! Thinking about how to turn a profit from dispensing of criminals runs directly contrary to the established sentiment that society must be willing to sacrifice significant resources to kill people off.

Edit: in the case where there is only one criminal ever, you’re correct that organ harvesting is fine! But real life is a case of repeated games (ie we must deal with more than one criminal), and in the case of repeated games we have to think about this feedback loop.

The IPCC has a bunch of them. In fact, NONE of them accurately mirrored the temperature rises.

“a model is not a guess, you using your feels to decide this research is not valid is a guess.”

If you try to model something and it does not accurately reflect reality, your model is wrong. If you do it 40 or 50 different times with different weighting of the variables and they all come out wrong, I think it is fair to say they are guesses. This is not denigrating the scientists, this is pointing out that modeling our planetary atmosphere is so complex that it cannot yet be accurately accomplished.

Never said they were lying for money. I said their predictions vary a lot. Depending on which scientists you talk to, we will have catastrophic warming even if all CO2 emissions stopped today. Others say we can avoid it. Every prediction is different. But once again....scientists do research to get paid. If the data doesn’t support the goals of the person paying them, they stop getting paid. This isn’t some shocking revelation, it’s literally business as usual.

“does it include all the animals and plants that died? how about all the oil that couldnt be cleaned and spread across the ecosystem?”

It’s as cleaned up as the signs and trash left by the pipeline protesters, except the protesters didn’t pay to clean up their mess, BP did.


“I think comparing a pipeline to an ocean floor well is pretty much the same as comparing the trash protesters leave to a fucking pipeline spill.

3. I never said the pipeline itself was bad, just the argument that the protesters did just as much damage was stupid.”


Let’s examine the potential impacts, shall we?

Pipeline spill into the aquifer: based on current pipeline tech, probably between 20-100 gallons would spill. (Biggest spill recorded was 168 gallons).  Company pays fine, comes in and cleans the aquifer on their own dime. Cost: probably around $500,000-800,000. Mostly depends on how much water and soil they have to clean.

Protester garbage into the aquifer: There were 800+ dumpsters of garbage. If 1% got leaked in, that is 8 dumpsters of garbage. Each dumpster probably holds a volume of around 500-700 gallons (this is mental math. Picture how many 55 gal drums could fit in a big dumpster. I guessed 8-10) This included feces, rotting food, and animal corpses. There is no company to be held responsible. The U S government had to clean it up.

As most churches/religious sects are tax exempt and typically don't want their customers to know how much money they already have, as it might discourage donations, it's hard to find reliable data.

Germany is an exception, as here the tithing is calculated abd carried out by secular tax authorities. We know that the Catholic and main Protestant church in Germany took in 12.4 billion Euros in 2018.

Germany has 83 million citizens, of an estimazed 7.7BN perople on the planet, But only about half of them are members of the two main churches.

But let's disregard that, as a safety buffer, as other countries and religions may tithe at a different/less consistent level, and pretend that 12.4 was the number for all of religious tithing in Germany.

Even then, the order of magnitude of the income of churches/mosques/temples/other religious organizations would be around 1000 billion USD per year, or one million million USD.

 Lets talk about climate science fraud. There was a discussion once concerning Michael Mann. I believe he once was party to a conversation where the Medieval Warm period was regarded as a problem because it showed warmer temperatures than the present. 

Shortly thereafter he created a study that got rid of the MWP. 

He had this study presented as a graph on the front of an IPCC report. People wondered why the IPCC would go from a reort that showed the MWP to one that suddenly did not.

People asked for the data and algorithms that were used in this report.Mann refused to show them.. You know sort of like you when you copy answers off another person's test paper. 

Mann had his ass called before Congress and it was determined that he would not re;ease the information there either. The persons looking into his work were able to determine that he both used data that skewed the results to make the MWP disappear, AND used math equations that did the same. It was a big shitshow with Mann repeatedly claiming that he came by his results honestly.

Consensus: Mann then tried to claim to be cleared by consensus.He set about with a group of cohorts to get a number of them to repeat the experiment using his same banned proxies and same improper math operations. 

Why do I say banned? Because the National Academy of Science reviewed his sources and made the claim that they should never be used in temperature reconstructions because they did not indicate temperature change but instead showed moisture change.

And MANN knew it. He had been warned at one point that tree ring cores were not proper for this use by an arborist.

Yet Mann gathered all these allies to repeat the same fraudulent process and they obliged printing out study after study claiming to have found a hockeystick shape. 

Mann himself tried to repeat his folly. He again used the banned tree ring proxies and said See? the same result!
When called on this he then tried  to do the same without the tree rings. He failed. So he looked for a proxy that was not a tree ring. Mia Tiljander had a sediment proxy from Korrtajarvi that she had used in a study. Mann wanted to use it because by looking at it he could see that the shape would result in a hockeystick. Mainly because he had an algorithm that would multiply that proxy by 300 times and override other neutral proxies. 

SO he used it but Ms. Tiljander warned him that one end of the proxy was contaminated and should not be used for his purposes. 

What was a poor dishonest climate scientist to do?????

 He had to clear his name!!! He determined that the proxy could be used upside down and give the same result....So that is what he did. his destroyed the timeline accuracy of the study but Mann had his hockeystick shape back.

Gavin Schmidt at RealClimate was the point man for defending Mann. After it was pointed out repeatedly in print at that blogsite Schmidt quit discussing Mann and his frauds. The damage to the other climatologists and the reputation of the site was getting larger and larger.
 To This day Mann pushes the use of these banned proxies . PAGES 2K and PAGES 2017 are using them blindly although NAS still prohibits them for temperature reconstructions.

I guess the REAL CONSENSUS is that you can lie and cheat over and over in producing a study if your buddies go along.

[],Pylgrim,,,[],,,,text,t2_74gvx,False,[],"&gt;to you I shouldn’t ask anything like that! How dare I question the subject..with a straight face.

How have I said that you may not question? I've many times stated that science evolves by constantly iterating and taking into consideration new data. My criticism was pointed at your use of ""selective"" taking into account that you pretend that one or a few studies that corroborate your position are the ""correct"" ones while you dismiss the literal hundreds of other studies that contradict your beliefs and which you haven't even read.

&gt; No politics in science comment 

Are you actually reading what I'm writing or just skimming? I didn't say that there are ""no politics""; I said that the fact that an issue is politicized is not a disqualifier for the science itself. Anybody can take science and make it into a political talking point but that doesn't mean that all of a sudden the science becomes fake for it. It's not like there's nothing *else* to the topic other than kids and politicians making sob speeches about it. If you dislike politics so, why do you pay so much attention to them? Read the scientifical studies instead! (and not only those who seemingly support your conclusions). You'll find them deliciously dry and cut in comparison.

&gt; What if it hasn’t stopped? Sorry I should question that and trust your opinion.., 

As I said at the beginning of this conversation, the difference is that now most of the scientific body concurs with the predictions. It was not the case 20-30 years ago.

&gt; Science ‘works’ by not making blanket statements that the debate is over, no longer worthy of discussion, move along now. This most recent study refutes many claims in your creed and there are many more. 

It doesn't ""refute"" anything. You just have no idea how the scientific method works at all. Literally *anybody* can make a study. I myself could strap a thermometer to the top of my head for a month, and then graph my ""findings"" across a chart in which I plot a curve using semi-related data, maybe sprinkle some good correlation-causation fallacies, and then draw conclusions that may seemingly ""refute"" some of the current scientifical consensus. Would you trust my ""conclusions""? (and as an exercise on self-reflection, would you trust them *more* if they align with your established beliefs?) 

Studies have to be submitted to the scrutiny of the scientific community and if the one you keep mentioning is *only* 2 months old (newest doesn't equal better, btw) it clearly hasn't been given enough scrutiny yet. Give it some more time and either, its claims will be proven true and the whole scientific consensus will change to admit it, or you'll start seeing people posting essays and possibly other studies actually refuting its conclusions (by proving that results cannot be replied, logic is faulty or incomplete, sample sizes disallow conclusiveness, etc).

&gt; Maybe they will have some big revisions coming soon. I don’t know but neither do you. 

I invite you to reread our conversation so far. In it, you'll find out that at every point I have admitted the possibility of the current consensus to be wrong and that if it is, science will find it out and science will correct course. On the other hand, it is you the one who uses absolute, loaded terms such as ""worship"" or ""religion"" to show the profound bias and contempt you feel for the consensus and your inability to even *consider the possibility* that it may be right. I've been talking to you at every point on scientific terms while you try to refute me with unrelated fluff. I've told you that since the mass use of fossil fuels the temperature on Earth changed thrice as much as it had done it during the previous millennium in only a tenth of the time... and you talk to me about the house that Obama bought.

&gt; Scientist who question the religion of global warming are ridiculed and marginalized by politicians and media and some cohorts 

A question for you: Do you call the theory of gravity a ""religion""? Quantum Physics? Relativity? Because all of those are established consensuses which are NOT hotly debated every day by acknowledging that some random people have come up with their own far fetched theories to explain those phenomena. So *again*, why single out this scientifical consensus? It seems to me that if you dislike the existence of accepted consensus in academia, you should be equally against them all, in order to keep yourself intellectually honest.

&gt; If you question the narrative, your pushed out. 

That is inaccurate. More accurately, ""If you question the narrative and your counterargument cannot withstand scrutiny, you're pushed out."" As I said previously, not every single position with relation to a topic deserves the same kind of attention or consideration. Some are simply false and deserve to be ""pushed out"". You cannot with any degree of seriousness argue that being ""pushed out"" is proof of a theory being true and unfairly disqualified unless you want to suddenly find yourself batting for people like the flat-Earthers.

&gt; If you live in the 3rd world and struggle to live with food, how will we ship goods and medicine world-wide? How will we feed an ever growing population? How Will commerce and trade continue? 

I am really not sure why you are bringing this up? Where have you heard that we're planning to ""ban"" hydrocarbons to the point where it could disrupt essential stuff like the food supply chain? That's ridiculous, no wonder you seem so against it if you believe that. The measures that are already planned and developed towards diminishing emissions are either cuts to non-essential stuff or lateral moves into ""greener"" alternatives (which, in many cases, have proved to also be more efficient.) 

&gt; Couldn’t argue with Lysenko and his bogus agricultural research... Other scientists questioned the validity of the studies but...millions starved. 

Nice try there to compare Lysenko and Soviet Russia to the global scientific community! It wouldn't be a real discussion with a red-blooded American if at any point we didn't try to introduce some good ol' pinko scaremongering, would it? If any, your ruggedly individualistic rogue scientists who ""dare"" question the ""religion"" of the *overwhelming majority* of scientists would be a much more immediate parallel to Lysenko.

&gt; strangely the environmentalists goof balls never want to talk nuclear

Lies, lies, lies. Every environmentalist knows and claims that nuclear energy is a step forward. I have no idea where in the world you are getting that they do not. Do you want to know why nobody wants to speak about nuclear these days? Because your precious overlords, the fossil fuels industry has desperately been fighting for their survival for decades and nuclear power was at one point the biggest opponent they were facing. So they created a massive campaign of fearmongering and disinformation to sell the idea that nuclear is massively dangerous and not worth the risk for all its absolutely undeniable benefits. So successful was their campaign that the topic became career-ending for state politicians who attempted to bring nuclear energy into their states and we basically have to wait until that generation dies off before trying again. In the meantime, they are now pushing a campaign of fearmongering, lies and disinformation against global warming, their latest enemy. They seem to be having great success again! But hey, let's blame the ""goofball"" environmentalists! They want to make us into Soviet-era communist gulags, or something.

Not at all. You would know that if you looked into this even a bit. 

Lets look at the data used instead.

This is the type of data we are looking at:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance

&gt;Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) is a measure of the solar power over all wavelengths per unit area incident on the Earth's upper atmosphere. It is measured perpendicular to the incoming sunlight.[2] The solar constant is a conventional measure of mean TSI at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU).

This is the data recorded - set date range to entire of 2017.
http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/data/sorce_tsi_6hr_l3/

The big spike down occured during the suns most active period in terms of high powered flares in over a decade now. The X9.3 flare supercharged hurricane irma (funny how energetic solar events coincide with extreme weather - the most recent hurricane to hit the news forget the name coincided with a week or so of geomagnetic storm conditions).

See this for reference:
https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/solar-activity/top-50-solar-flares/year/2017


Now if I take the liberty of simplifying the solar flares and coronal mass ejections - I will refer to them as sun farts as they are emissions from the sun.
The data you see above is literally indicating that sun farts are cold.

The biggest nuclear explosions in our entire solar system are assumed to be cold. These events even impact the rotation speed of earth!!! You can find that paper with google easily enough.

They assume that X/Gamma ray radiation has ZERO impact because its absorbed in the ionosphere and does not cause direct thermal forcing.

This is a really strange point. You can still eat and lower your carbon emissions. What does driving a big pick up truck or SUV, flying on vacation, eating meat every day, running your coal powered AC in a poorly insulated house, etc have to do with having enough food? The problem is excess consumption without having to pay all the external costs, and then getting angry when the bill finally arrives. 

Look at who's denying climate change, it's almost universally the far right. They don't do it because they know better than the scientist, they do it because their politicians tell them that the subject is too politicized, so they can say that the other team (since politics are divided into teams now for some reason) want's you to believe all these scientists to get more power. It's the denyers that politicizing the issue, the science and the data is clear. And why does the politicians to the far right (including American republicans) not want to accept climate change and do something about it? Because it would cost money for their companies, and it would take new regulations and economic restructuring.

[],Rhenic,,,[],,,,text,t2_dwiif,False,[],"First of all; Thank you for your reply!

You pointed out that ""defeatism is toxic""; And I'd like to respond to that first:

I'd like to point out where I'm coming from; 

I acknowledge that global warming is real, and caused by humans. I also acknowledge the consequences we are facing. I just have some trouble with solutions being thrown around, along with a level of ad hominem attacks on anyone trying to point out flaws in those solutions.

I'd say I'm closer to being on the side of the climate activist, than on the side of most humans who still have doubts about climate change being real, let alone caused by humans (I also acknowledge that this is caused by the misinformation campaigns funded by big oil etc.).

If people already aren't willing to enter the dialogue with someone like me; To show me how I'm wrong and try to get my support for these solutions; Than what chance do we have of convincing the majority required for actual change?

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the trees!

The ""trees solution"" that's been very popular the past few months, is based on research that showed there is room available to grow 1 trillion trees worldwide.

This research points out these trees would be able to store 205 gigatons of co2.

At current rates; that's about 6 years of pollution (we're at 37 gigatons/year right now)

It would take about 30 years for these trees to grow, and actually store that carbon.

&amp;#x200B;

This means that at current rates; If we planted 1 trillion trees today (and a lot of these areas are completely inaccessible areas like Siberia or the north of Canada, planting those trees could prove very, very challenging; There's oil in these areas that Big Oil doesn't care about because of the tremendous cost involved with reaching these areas). In 30 years we would still be looking at an additional 905 gigatons of co2 put into the air, and that's assuming the worlds carbon footprint doesn't increase even one gram from what it is now, which doesn't seem very likely.

This would still put us at 4 degrees of global warming in 33 years, with no area left to plant more trees on.

&amp;#x200B;

And all of that is assuming the numbers are as positive as the original research claimed; which, seems to be anything but guaranteed:  [https://newatlas.com/trees-reforestation-climate-change/60446/](https://newatlas.com/trees-reforestation-climate-change/60446/) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Eating less meat and buying a new vehicle (with a giant carbon footprint associated with its production), when looking at the actual numbers, feels to me like someone standing at the edge of the burning amazon, spitting in the fire once, and screaming ""why isn't anyone helping!?"".

If we actually want to solve this situation; we need to make concessions that even those at the forefront of this battle aren't willing to make, concessions that will have an impact close to what the actual climate change would bring about a couple decades later; Mass unemployment; Giant reductions in quality of life (no vehicles, no heating/air-conditioning, no new electronic devices, no data-centers, no modern healthcare, the list goes on).

To me; It comes across as hypocritical superiority, when people talk down the ""realists"" who aren't willing to join the fight by buying a new electric car (with a production carbon footprint of about 30-40 years worth of what our carbon footprint should actually be if we want to stay under 4 degrees by 2100 (which is still catastrophic).

The person buying that EV just did their part in setting humanity back 30-40 years in terms of climate-progress, and at the same time has the audacity to talk down to other people for ""not doing their part"".

I agree that I have a defeatist position on the situation; But I find it hard to take a different one, when looking at the actual numbers behind the whole thing. I would love for someone to point out the errors in my reasoning, or in the numbers involved; Because as it stands; To me it feels like that defeatism is justified :(",1569454582,{},f1fwhux,False,t3_d8g0e6,False,True,t1_f1frfrr,/r/worldnews/comments/d8g0e6/climate_change_hitting_harder_and_sooner_than/f1fwhux/,1569454583.0,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],ServetusM,,,[],,,,text,t2_iy71r,False,,"&gt;It was a three pronged assault on our elections. First prong was multi-site social media attack. Twitter accounts including TEN_GOP, with over 150k followers, retweeted by Presidential candidate Trump himself. 

Oh wow, 150k followers? Oh MY GOD! Hey buddy, can I ask...What was illegal about this? Like why is this bad? Are...evil Russians not allowed to tweet? 

&gt;Targeting facebook ads in key battleground states by county to maximize votes (polling data was given by Manafort himself).

Russians spent 200k on Facebook ads. Around 40% of them were Pro-Hillary (Because the point was to cause dissension regardless of who won and literally cause the hysteria you're buying into).  Tell me, are American elections so vulnerable that some Russian trolls on Facebook can destroy them using .1% of the money spent on ads in the campaign? You realize other foreign nationals produces A LOT more political rhetoric that could be construed as ""affecting the election"" within social media right? 

But lets focus on the core of your ridiculous argument here. That a couple dozen or so Russians, trolling facebook, brought down a nation wide election where BILLIONS were spent and campaigns ran entire 'troll farms' to affect them? Shareblue's troll farm was hundreds of people. This was a hysterical reaction, especially from the pro-""globalist"" party.

I guess globalism good...until others speak. 

&gt;2nd prong was with Russian intelligence agents coming to America in person. They held rallies, hired actors to portray political figures, and helped create grassroots movements. 

You realize this has been happening for decades right? A lot of the Civil Rights movement was run and funded by Communist agents...from Russia. 

Blaming those evil, evil Russians is a way to do what McCarthy attempted to due during that era...Which is distract from WHY those movements resonated. What failure in policy in America allowed grass roots political movements to form. And just because a ""russian"" started them, does that mean the thing those movements care about didn't exist? 

This is called poisoning the well. Its switching the frame from the problem, to the person. The fact is, the number of ""rallies"" held by Russians were minuscule, only one even got media attention and that rally was copying the rhetoric ALREADY present in the campaigns of the political opponents. Saying this had a ""big effect"" on anything is utterly ridiculous. 

&gt;3rd prong was IMO the most successful. They hacked the DNC and RNC servers through phishing attacks and stole all their data. They took the DNC data and handed it over to wikileaks. They released the wikileaks data on the same day one hour later after the ""grab them by the pussy"" Trump video came out. 

Oh, those dastardly Russians, telling Americans the truth is such a destructive tactic! 

lol. On this point...how the fuck is this Trump's fault? Leaks happen, everyone is under cyber attack ALL the time by both friendly and antagonistic foreign governments (Yes, our ""friends"" spy on us). A private citizens/organization computer system got hacked. This organization didn't even turn over the crime scene to the FBI, and used an agent in its own employ to turn a failure on their part into a national hysteria--blaming someone that had NOTHING to do with it. 

And all this...to once again poison the well. To somehow invalidate the damning information that came out which was true, by blaming the source. 

&gt;The Internet Research Agency Indictments from the Special Council Office. There's more detail in the Mueller Report but its 500 pages long.

Yes, Mueller charged a group of men he knew would never go to trial and thus no evidence of what ""wrong doinng"" there was would never need to come to light. 

You know what ALL of those charges are? Almost none of it has anything to do with election fraud. Its almost solely ID theft. Why? Because most of what the Russians were doing in regard to the election...was not illegal. 

That's why the government had to resurrect FARA, which had not been enforced [criminally and civilly in 4 decades. 
](https://oig.justice.gov/press/2016/2016-09-07.pdf). A law which NSD, the agency which runs FARA, gave PUBLIC guidance was not being criminally OR civilly enforced, because the LDA (Lobbying Disclosure Act) largely replaced it. The FBI literally charged some poor fucking woman with this law just to show some precedence, so they could use it to bully people again. The amount of underhanded shit the DOJ has undertaken in this hysteria should sicken people. 


&gt;Except it tells us they are using the same tactics as 2016, they just moved the fucking building. It's shitty. The US has no reason to go outside the country to ask other countries to hack us and spread propaganda to win an election. It's a national security issue, it's immoral, it's unethical, it weakens us and destroys the sanctity of the electoral process.


You realize Hillary Clinton had Fusion GPS buying intel from Russian agents right? Opposition research is an essential part of any campaign because most people who run for President have extensive experience overseas. 

Are you saying there is NO reason for Americans to be informed of such activities? I wonder then how you explain the ""Dossier"" which had that ""information"" on Trump? Was that ""okay"" because it was the ""good kind"" of information you enjoy? 

Immoral...Unethical? This is America, we have free speech here. We can talk to who we want, when we want, including those ""evil Russians"". Which is why what Hillary did was legal. Its why what Trump doing is legal.  Whoa unto the society that begins to think information is immoral and unethical. No sir. Knowing as much as we can is ethical, its moral--its *necessary*.

It's funny that your weird screenshot articles have no verifiable source, and yet the data itself is misleading. But I did some digging and it comes from the ultra-right wing Daily Caller, so I'm not surprised it's horseshit. 

&gt;The first is a comprehensive study issued every year by the energy company BP,  called the Statistical Review of World Energy. It uses a different methodology but produced similar findings as the EPA data — a 0.5 percent decline in emissions for the United States in 2017 (Trump’s first year) over 2016 (Obama’s last). The study found that it was the third consecutive year that emissions in the United States had declined, ""though the fall was the smallest over the last three years.""

&gt;In other words, emissions declined under Trump, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the late Obama era. (The BP study was released on the same day as Bloomberg published the EPA statement, so it’s not clear that the agency could have known about it when it made its statement.) A second set of data from the Energy Information Administration, a data-collecting unit of the federal Energy Department, showed a similar pattern.

&gt;The EIA data covers 2017 and the first two months of 2018. However, it totals only the emissions from the energy sector, which is a significant source of emissions, but not the only one. Like the BP report, EIA found that that carbon emissions from energy declined between 2016 and 2017.

&gt;But the annual decline slowed on Trump’s watch in the EIA data, too. In 2017, when Trump was president, emissions fell by less than 1 percent. That was a smaller decrease than for either of Obama’s final two years. In 2016, emissions fell by 1.64 percent from their 2015 level, and for 2015, they fell by 2.68 percent over their 2014 level. In addition, the EIA estimated that emissions will actually rise over the next two years. In 2018, the agency forecasts a 1.1 percent increase, and in 2019, it projects a 0.2 percent increase.

But wait, there's more actual science and not bullshit right-wing talking points!


&gt;A new report has found that US carbon dioxide emissions rose by 3.4% in 2018 after three years of decline. The spike is the largest in eight years, according to Rhodium Group, an independent economic research firm.  While the Rhodium report notes these figures - pulled from US Energy Information Administration data and other sources - are estimates, The Global Carbon Project, another research group, also reported a similar increase in US emissions for 2018.

“Freak yachting accidents do happen…”

That was how British businessman, Trump ally, and Brexit bankroller Arron Banks responded to the news that Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen who inspired the school climate strikes movement, was sailing to America to attend the UN Climate Action Summit. His scorn was not unique.

Many people have already spilled thousands of words of commentary explaining how personal attacks on Greta — often lobbed by old white men, sometimes mocking her Aspergers — are unacceptable. But understanding where those attackers come from, ideologically and professionally, casts an important light on some of their dark statements.

That’s because a large subsection of the commentariat driving the abuse of Greta is part of an established network of radical free-marketeer lobby groups — a network that has firm ties to the fossil fuel industry and funders of climate science denial.

European Attacks
Greta first shot to prominence in Europe, and that’s where the earliest mudslinging emerged.

https://twitter.com/Arron_banks/status/1161747086616010752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1161747086616010752&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.desmog.co.uk%2F2019%2F09%2F15%2Fattacks-greta-thunberg-right-wing-free-market-network

Banks’ tweet was one of the most high-profile. He is among the most prominent funders of Brexit, with long-standing ties to the UK Independence Party and its former leader Nigel Farage. UKIP’s politician, Neil Hamilton, was one of the first to be called out for posting what was perceived by many as a bullying tweet directed at Greta, who is 16 years old.

Farage has now set up a new outfit, the Brexit Party, also bankrolled by Banks. The party has 29 members in the European Parliament, many of them climate science deniers, thanks to winning 30 percent of the vote in May’s elections.

While resisting calls to form an official alliance, the Brexit Party MEPs join other far-right populist parties in Brussels, including Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (formerly the Front National) and Alternative for Germany (AfD). All are united in their hatred for Greta. Two National Rally MPs recently boycotted her visit to France, and AfD representatives have made coordinated attacks on social media.

Those aggressions were orchestrated by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) — an organization known for co-sponsoring events with U.S. free-market think tank, the Heartland Institute.

Trans-Atlantic Potshots
It’s perhaps unsurprising to find that many of the U.S. commentators verbally assaulting Greta also have ties to the Heartland Institute, given the organisation’s Big Oil funding and long-history of promoting climate science denial.

Greta Thunberg Fist-Bumped Obama Before Her Congressional Testimony
BY LUCY DIAVOLO
The institute’s website published a long blog post by one of its ‘policy experts’, Gregory Wrightstone, who attempted to refute many of Thunberg’s arguments for climate action. “It is time for her to go back to school to learn what she doesn’t know and to unlearn so much of what she has been taught,” he concluded.

Many other critics of Greta in the U.S. are tied to another of Heartland’s funders, the Koch family, owners of the U.S.’s largest private energy company.

Marc Morano, communications director of campaign group Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and a regular speaker at Heartland Institute events, has a long history of spreading misinformation about climate change.

He was also one of the loudest critics of Greta’s visit to the U.S., appearing on Ezra Levant’s Rebel Media to describe the young activist as “bait” to entrap critics of climate policy. Levant was an intern at the Charles Koch Foundation and later worked for the Koch-funded Fraser Institute.

Morano’s arguments were echoed on CFACT’s website by Joe Bastardi, a meteorologist who worked for AccuWeather, a private forecasting company that in the 1990s was involved with the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) — a now-defunct fossil fuel industry front group that strongly opposed global greenhouse gas reduction policies.

CFACT has received significant donations from oil companies including Exxon and Chevron, as well as oil billionaire Richard Scaife.

One of Greta’s most prominent critics has been Steve Milloy, a self-styled “pioneer” fighting against “faulty scientific data used to advance special, and often hidden, agendas.” Milloy is, among other things, an adjunct scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).

The CEI’s director of energy and environment, Myron Ebell, was part of of President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency transition team, and is infamous for making regular media appearances spreading oft-debunked misinformation on climate change.

Says the person hurling around ad hominem attacks.

&gt;and anything that doesn't fall into your narrow little view of the world, you just shrug it off as propaganda.

What are you talking about? Baseless rhetoric that repeats decades of propaganda is definitely a form of propaganda.

&gt;You ignore all of the small businesses that were saved by Trump's tax cuts. 

Do you honestly believe these small businesses would have died without the breadcrumbs Trump tossed at them while he was fulfilling the wishes of the wealthy elite?

His trade war has cost the working class consumer *and* small businesses way more than his tax cuts gave them, you're spinning a defunct narrative borne from actual right wing propaganda.

From your source:

&gt;Lana Pol’s small businesses are enjoying big savings under the new tax law — **at least for now.**

&gt;Views on the benefits of tax reform have also waned somewhat, despite the boost it’s given to sentiment, according to data from CNBC and SurveyMonkey. **In the first quarter of 2018, 46 percent of small business owners said that government tax policy would have a positive effect on their business over the next year. By the fourth quarter, that number fell to 31 percent — the lowest recorded in the two years since polling began.**

The effects of Trump's trade war on manufacturing, retail, tech, agriculture and more:

&gt;These articles talk about how Trump's policies are a step in the right direction, and how these businesses were able to hire more workers and increase wages as a result. 

And those benefits have been completely wiped out by Trump's trade war, but the wealthy still get their disproportionately large windfall, the breadcrumbs Trump wiped off the table for the working class or small business pale in comparison to what his real goal was.

&gt;If you're this uninformed about Trump's tax cuts, and how much of a disaster the ACA was, what else are you clueless about? What's worse, instead of learning, you refuse to learn, and just shrug facts off as propaganda. You've built your own jail cell using bricks fashioned from willful ignorance. You refuse to see the sun shine, while everyone else is outside playing, all because you have so much hate inside of you. Eating you up like acid. I can tell you're already less of a person than you were yesterday.

The ACA wasn't a disaster, my man, it was sabotaged by the GOP who refused to buy into markets so it would *look* like a disaster.

So you claiming that the ACA was a disaster is absolutely borne of GOP propaganda.

All of your rhetoric is baseless projection, and the fact you have to rely on ad hominem attacks just shows how baseless it all is.

We have data going back much further than a few hundred years. Here's just one example:

https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2540/tree-rings-provide-snapshots-of-earths-past-climate/

It is also scientifically agreed upon.

&gt;The green house theory doesn't not hold water as there are many flaws in regards to it.

List the flaws. You've made a claim, but it hasn't been backed up.

&gt;For starters the narrative that the leading reason for the increase of GHGs is human industrial activity is completely and utterly ridiculous as such a measurment has never been properly done.Nodoby knows for a fact weather the increase of GHGS is 99% or 10% influenced by man.

Are you not aware of how statistics works? There's a ridiculous trend that shows it is anthropocentric. The exact percentage is unknown like with everything else in the universe, but it clearly points to climate change being influenced by man alone.

&gt;The result of a flawed measurment analysis is a whooping 1 degree global increase over 100 years. That's a value less then the statistical error of a flawed analysis.

An increase of 1 degree globally is massive. Your subconscious is confusing impact in temperature for weather as opposed to climate. A ""statistical error"" depends on the values themselves. 

&gt;Do you even know on what data these computer models are based upon?And how this data is collected?

Yes. I've answered both questions up above.

&gt;If vast majority of the data is collected arbitrarily and not meticulously because we have no means to do so then how can you expect the results to be anything but misleading?Which is why they have been off time and time again.

Oh boy. You're not supposed collect data meticulously, that's called cherry picking. Data for analysis is strictly meant to be collected in an arbitrary manner to reduce bias. They have been correct time and time again.

&gt;The reason it is necessary to have a bigger frame of reference is because you lack any of the data that shows regular or extreme natural or cosmical occurrences that had affected the planet before.

False. We have much of that data thanks to dendroclimatology and ice cores. Please learn what climate proxies are.

&gt;it doesn't help that most GHG advocates refuse to acknowledge that sun activity poses a bigger threat to global warming then we ever could with our current technology.

It's a good thing then that the Sun isn't going anywhere or doing any _new_ process within our lifetimes. They don't refuse to acknowledge it by itself, they refuse to acknowledge that it is relevant.

I'll try to dig them up. I'm in the midst of trying to get better organized, so maybe now's the time to better organize all my random bookmarks lol

&gt;One other thing I’m not sure I understand is the extent to which machines are capable of developing theses or underlying fundamental understandings that humans have yet to develop or even ponder.

Its weird, and even as a programmer who's kinda watched the tech emerge and kind of understand... I still really don't. But IMO the scariest part of the modern age is that even as someone who doesn't understand, you can still get incredibly powerful models out of the open source tech that exists. 

The TL;DR is that different problems can be categorized by the type of problem they're aiming to solve. Maybe its a classification problem where you want to group things around known labels, or a clustering problem where you want to group things based on key indicators but don't yet know what the labels are. Or maybe its some kind of regression modelling that tries to look at past results and plot some kind of linear curve that describes them which could then be used to project future results given whatever variables. While each model could likely individually be generated by humans, machine learning rapidly increases the rate at which you can develop those models, and expands the reach of the technology. Think how much more accessible product development is with 3D printers, vs the oldschool way where you have to research &amp; find manufacturers and pay out the nose for each iteration... except the feedback loops are faster and ultimately more far reaching. 

&gt;To date, I’ve heard of machine learning and AI that produce astounding results within the general parameters and assumed conclusions given to them by human beings, but nothing truly and/or independently “out of the box,” so to speak.

I think this depends on what your definition of out of the box entails. Personally, I'm still amazed constantly by what technology can do now that it couldn't 10 years ago. Models being overfitted is definitely a big concern, but its gotten better, and is ultimately at the control of the team developing the models so its not really a computer limitation. 90+% of the work now with ML development is in compiling, cleaning and preparing the data for training. If you want to see a truly mind boggling piece of tech that will open your synapses, check out [Amazone Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). Amazon had all their AWS tech already which included various sets of ML tooling, and realizes most of the work was in the preparing, categorizing and cleaning of data stage, so they released SageMaker which uses ML to prepare your data for training your ML... I shit you not. All of this future tech sounding stuff is now becoming so turnkey its almost approaching being LEGO. 

&gt;Are you saying we’re right on the cusp of those “outside the box” sort of insights? I assume you are. And if so, how exactly does that translate to AI figuring out how to interface with our biological makeup, namely our brain matter and nervous system in general?

Yes. Not necessarily just because of quantum computers, but just in general 100x yes. Technology is an exponential curve, and we're living through the heel of it where we're just now starting to realize how fast things have changed over the past 100-200 years. The next 100 years will be truly insane, and the next 10 years will be transformative, while the next 3 (Canada's election, the US election, and Germany's election in 2021) will be critical IMO. 

Re: how ML helps with BCI, modern neuroscience is being propelled by machine learning enabling it to make sense of the uncountable number of circuits in the brain. The older school brain breakdown of all the gyruses is increasingly dated while we've managed to map specific circuits in higher res, and some teams have applied machine learning to the data resulting from increasingly high res scans of the brain. The entire field is admittedly incredibly crude compared to most other modern sciences. The best description I've heard is that our understanding of the brain is at around our understanding of medicine when we still practiced medicinal cannibalism lol. But the missing ingredient is ultimately computational engines capable of computing faster than our meat computers, which despite being remarkably stupid, are also orders of magnitude more efficient computers per energy cost than any device you've ever touched, and given our exponential tech curve and ML in general being at the precipice of controlling everything, IMO neuroscience is going to see staggering developments over the next 20-30 years that will easily enable an implant driven cyber borg.",1569128370,{},f11okki,False,t3_d7ego2,False,True,t1_f11jx2n,/r/worldnews/comments/d7ego2/microsoft_chief_brad_smith_says_rise_of_killer/f11okki/,1569130813.0,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; 
&gt; Bob Mercer has accepted is that climate change is not happening. It's not for real, and if it is happening, it's going to be good for the planet
&gt; 
&gt; Among other things, Mercer said the United States went in the wrong direction after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and also insisted the only remaining racists in the United States were African-Americans, according to Magerman.
&gt; 
&gt; they believe that nuclear war is really not such a big deal. And they've actually argued that outside of the immediate blast zone in Japan during World War II - outside of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - that the radiation was actually good for the Japanese. So they see a kind of a silver lining in nuclear war and nuclear accidents. Bob Mercer has certainly embraced the view that radiation could be good for human health - low level radiation.

&gt; White supremacist about Thiel's race views to Milo Yiannopoulos: ""He’s fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.""
&gt; 
&gt; Some of his other new world order views:
&gt; 
&gt; Thiel has become a national figure of controversy for, among other things, claiming that “the extension of the franchise to women [women's right to vote] render the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,” saying, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” funding a fellowship that specifically tries to get undergraduates to drop out of college, and donating $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s campaign a week after a tape was released in which the then-candidate discussed how he could grope young female actresses and get away with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thiel was long perceived as a libertarian, but in recent years, as his support for Trump illustrates, his politics have taken a nationalist flavor that critics have described as bordering on authoritarian and white nationalist.
&gt; 
&gt; In Oct. 2016, shortly after Thiel donated $1.25 million to Trump, Thiel publicly apologized for passages in his 1995 book The Diversity Myth, such as claiming that some alleged date rapes were “seductions that are later regretted,” ... But three months later, during the after party of the 30-year anniversary event at Thiel’s home, Thiel stated that his apology was just for the media, and that “sometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear.”

&gt; The Republican Koch family billions:
&gt; 
&gt; David and Charles Koch, the fabulously rich brothers who turned an oil and manufacturing empire inherited from their father into a cash cow for rightwing causes
&gt; 
&gt; Even in his 20s, David Koch was attending a “Freedom School” where he learnt about “anarcho-capitalism” and the virtues of small government and abolishing taxes. Low taxes would be personally appealing to someone with a vast and growing fortune like his.
&gt; 
&gt; So too would countering any effort to penalize toxic corporations in the fight against climate change. By Greenpeace’s reckoning, in the 20 years to 2017, the Kochs ploughed about $127m into 92 groups that were involved in rebuffing climate crisis solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; “David Koch won’t live to see the worst of climate change but the legacy of denial and the intensified delay caused by his funding will live on,” said Kert Davies, director of the Climate Investigation Center.
&gt; 
&gt; Through AFP, the Kochs spawned a nationwide web of impassioned conservative volunteers, empowered by the new voter technology they supported through the political data firm i360. Among the key targets of their campaigning: the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which brought healthcare to millions of Americans but which the Kochs saw as big government interference. But it also took on climate crisis regulations, public education and taxes and championed the nascent 2010 Tea Party movement.
&gt; 
&gt; “A substantial part of David Koch’s legacy was the utter distortion of American democracy, which should be based on one person, one vote but was grossly twisted when he used his vast wealth to buy himself an influence that was out of all proportion.”
&gt; 
&gt; (it is well known that the Koch brothers support Republican candidates, but it is less well known that over two decades they spent not a single dime on any Democrat.)
&gt; 
&gt; Take Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which cost $1.5 trillion to the benefit of the rich above all others. The cuts follow a script very similar to the plan put forward by the Koch brothers – which helps explain why they went on to spend more than $20m promoting the legislation.
&gt; 
&gt; Koch Industries can also claim the distinction of being one of the country’s most highly polluting companies, behind only ExxonMobil and American Electric Power.

[],StoicAviator,,,[],,,,text,t2_409tiu92,False,,"That's just a weak form of whataboutism though. Very weak. An irrelevant. And that's why it's rejected.

If you consider it, all homicides start off as an attempted homicide; you can't be successful if you don't try. People have a 97% chance of surviving a knife attack, but only a 67% chance of surviving a gun attack. So even if we assume for a second that every single attempted murder with a gun would also be an attempted murder with a knife, we would have, statistically, roughly 30% less deaths. In practicality, those numbers probably wouldn't hold exactly and we wouldn't quite see a 30% higher survival rate, but we would almost certainly still see a significantly higher one. 

But that's a big if. There's a certainly psychology with guns. They're quick, they're easy, they make you feel confident and powerful. Guns are enablers. Aside from vehicular homicide, other forms are a lot more personal and so require more commitment. And vehicles just aren't that popular as a weapon, possibly because it's hard to target one person and because unless they are on or near a street it's hard to get at them. In either case, guns are certainly a unique case from that perspective.

Lastly, there is no evidence to support the claim that gun control increases knife crime. Trump and the pro-gun crowd have often used ""knife deaths are so high in London, there's so much more than New York!"" as their rallying cry to show this is true, but the rate of knife deaths in London are practically identical between London and New York. They are usually within 0.01 or 0.02 per capita of each other, and usually it's New York that's higher.

To my other point, t's irrelevant and off-topic because gun control is about more than just reducing murders. If I was making an argument in favour of increasing funding for heart disease research and your counter-argument was ""what about cancer?"", I'd say that's a different issue and there's nothing the precludes us from going after better funding to both, but heart disease is personal to be and do that's the one I chose to focus on. Likewise, if someone is chosing to focus on gun control, any sort of ""what about knife deaths"" argument may not be something they are passionate about.

An increase in gun control had been shown in every study (with one exception which is from the 80s, using data from the 70s, and since rejected even by it's own author) to reduce suicides. Not just gun suicides, all suicides. It turns out when gun control is increased, the number of gun suicides goes way down an the other forms of suicides do not go up significantly. There's a few theories on this. One is that other methods are less lethal, which is true. The number of attempted suicides goes up a little, but not as much as the number of attempted gun suicides goes down. The other theory digs deeper into the psychology of gun use and had found the trend that gun suicides are generally committed by people with no history of mental illness or depression but have recently suffered an emotional trauma. More importantly, from those who survive, gun suicide seems to be preferred by people who wanted something quick, didn't care about disfigurement and acted on a whim without looking into other methods. In contast to these other methods which seem to have different reasons and psychology behind them.

Increased gun control also improves investigative methods... A recovered murder weapon has a better chance is being traced to the perpetrator or someone who enabled the perpetrator with better gun control. Compare the US, where there are a few instances of a handgun being recovered and, through background checks, traced to someone who sold it legally in a private sale stopping the trail cold, vs Canada where all handgun transfers are required to be reported so you know who the last legal owner was provide the gun wasn't smuggled across the border. That can help crack down on things like straw purchases but also helps identified those who engaged in crimes of passion using legally insured guns. Sure, lots of criminals aren't going to use a legal gun, but those engaged in crimes with little planning or forethought might, and the objective isn't the impossible apprehension of all criminals that use guns, but rather the reduction in gun deaths and increasing the apprehension of some number of criminals that use guns in their crimes is just an ancillary benefit, but one with mentioning.

Lastly, just as it's impossible to prove causation in most cases including gun ownership vis-a-vis gun deaths, it's impossible to prove causation between gun control and an increased death in other methods. Let's just assume for a minute that increasing gun control does result in an increase in knife deaths (which again, is extremely unlikely given the higher survival rate of knife attacks and the reduction in overall suicide rates)... then good! We have successfully reduced the amount of deaths with one tool! The objective has been successful. Gun control has effectively reduced gun deaths. It was effective at what it was designed to do. It wasn't designed to reduce knife murders, so the discussion of knife misses is irrelevant and off-topic. To go back to my earlier analogy, if we are about to significantly reduce the amount of deaths from heart disease only to find that cancer deaths have spiked, now we can look at what to do about cancer. I know you'll be tempted to explain how this is different than diseases, but at the end of the day look at how long it has taken me to explain why the knife death argument is weak whataboutism and you'll see no one wants to go through that every single time. ""I'm not talking about knives,"" is much easier and an equally valid counterpoint, especially for those who are only personally passionate about gun deaths.

So, in conclusion, when it comes to discussing gun control, ""what about knives?"" is weak whataboutism and off-topic. Knives are not guns, the statistics on knives are not the same as the statistics on guns, and so bringing up knives in a gun debate is as futile as bringing a knife to a gun fight.

Therefore, having your knife argument rejected isn't because people think knives can't be used as murder weapons, but rather because that's not the topic at hand and even a cursory investigation should show it's irrelevant.",1569088964,{},f0z8ec2,False,t3_d6yi43,False,True,t1_f0yyj8d,/r/worldnews/comments/d6yi43/trudeau_vows_to_ban_militarystyle_assault_rifles/f0z8ec2/,1569088965.0,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**John Ehrlichman, who worked with Fox News cofounder Roger Ailes on these strategies**:

&gt;[We] had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying?

&gt;We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

&gt;We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.

&gt;Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

Atwater, who partnered with Roger Ailes on the ""Southern Strategy"" to get the South to vote Republican:

&gt;You start out in 1954 by saying, ""N----r, n----r, n----r.""

&gt;By 1968 you can't say ""n----r"" — that hurts you. Backfires.

&gt;So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy

&gt;""He was the premier guy in the business,"" says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. ""He was our Michelangelo.""

&gt;Ailes repackaged Richard Nixon for television in 1968, papered over Ronald Reagan’s budding Alzheimer’s in 1984, shamelessly stoked racial fears to elect George H.W. Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993.

&gt;Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting “real people affected by taxes.”

[],Splinka77,,,[],,,,text,t2_ywr20,False,,"Alright, so here comes the rabbit hole...

The short answer is that I'm a social sciences student with a multidisciplinary background, who works in social services. My employment background spans education, corrections, coaching, and again, social services. My educational/training is a mix of formal and independent learning... I'm a life long learner and I'm also a curious soul. In the end, I only want to help my clients and society (altruistic motivation), as well as keep my kids safe and learn more about things (egotist motivation).

The quote you reference about being interesting speaks about a behavior known as ""self-medicating"", and it is common within the demographics who have concurrent disorders... That only means those who have one or more conditions which develop an interplay/synergistic effect. An example might be someone who has insomnia drinking to fall asleep... In turn they become alcoholic... Which causes more anxiety, which prevents sleep... Which leads to more drinking. (It doesn't have to be addictions/mental health, it can be any mix of anything really... But these are more common pairings).

In all things, skepticism is required... Sciences most of all. The quote you mentioned does provide this skepticism, but also obfuscates the facts of how such things work. Odds are that this was based on the ""limitations section"" of the study from which it came. And this is all well and good. The only issue is that these types of reports are often made from people in a singular discipline, and seldom from people with a multidisciplinary background... And in the case of the government document, they have to put in some form of plausible deniability in order to allow them to continue making it legal... If it was framed in the definitive, they couldn't justify it and would make themselves liable to future compensations.

The stats are tricky, and the paradox is not a real consideration... That is because they are only looking at the hard data, and not the psychological component which accompanies this data. What I had previously mentioned in my last post, along with self-medicating, are two things they overlook... And really, given what we are talking about, the fact that the chicken came first, or the egg really isn't as big an issue as the fact that the chicken exists and lays more eggs which in turn become chickens themselves.

As for research and children, there is a HUGE correlation.

[],iblostinthesauce,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lwlqllp,False,,"The 3 running positive feedback loops, warming oceans, melting glaciers, and thawing permafrost are the sign that we've already gone past the point of no return.  

Climate science was co-opted by big business back in the late 80's they flooded climate research with corporate money, funding research that gave them the answers they wanted, climate change was happening, it was happening slowly, and we had a lot of time to act.    The scientists that disagreed with the ""corporate"" position were financially frozen out, and shouted down.  The corporate money was also spent on very narrowly focused, specialized research, and the resulting data was used to make broad assumptions about the climate.  As a result most climate scientists left standing by the time of the Paris agreement, had zero experience with complex systems, or anything that had been excluded from the corporate money.  Permafrost is a key example.   

Up until about 20 years ago most climate scientists didn't think the permafrost could ever thaw on a large scale.  So when it started happening on a small scale it largely went unnoticed, but then some scientists recognized what was happening and started to study the permafrost, thinking the thawing was an anomalous  event.  It wasn't, in fact it's so bad that the thawed permafrost is now burning on a large scale.   Thawing permafrost is releasing significantly more CO2, Methane, and Nitrious Oxide then expected, with Methane and Nitrious Oxide being between 80 and 130 **times** worse than CO2.    

The nature of positive feedback loops is that they every cycle the change gets bigger, so that means every change from Winter to Summer the oceans warm, the glaciers melt and permafrost thaws more than the last cycle, and more CO2, Methane, and Nitrious Oxide get released which means the climate gets warmer, causing the the next cycle of ocean warming, glacier melting and permafrost thawing to be worse than the last cycle, and on and on and on.   

Soon the CO2, Methane, and Nitrious Oxide output from the earth will catch up to the human output.  Which means the Paris Agreement numbers are a joke, even if we could reduce human output, which we can't, we still can't control the positive feedback loops that are running.     If human greenhouse gas output were reduced to zero tomorrow, it won't stop the positive feedback loops.  We've triggered something we can't stop.    

Positive feedback loops don't stop until they exhaust the resources that fuel the loops, CO2, Methane, Nitrious Oxide, and the Oceans, glaciers and permafrost hold a considerable amount of greenhouse gases, enough to keep the loops running for thousands of years.    Unless something like a Super volcano erupts, or the earth is struck by a very large meteor, the warming of the climate **CAN'T** stop at 2c, we are heading to a hothouse earth, where temperatures could be 12c higher, which means most of the earth would be uninhabitable for humans, not to mention the radical sea level rise which would significantly reduce land available for habitation.

Jost reviewed 40 studies on differences in this need for cognition between liberals and conservatives. Of those, 25 showed a ""significant, negative"" association between need for cognition and right-wing orientation. In all but three of the others, there was a similar negative association but it wasn't statistically significant.

[**Circuit Court: North Carolina Law Targeted African-Americans “With Surgical Precision”**](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/07/circuit-court-north-carolina-law-targeted-african-americans-surgical-precision/)




&gt;The [original] version of SL 2013-381 provided that all government-issued IDs, even many that had been expired, would satisfy the requirement as an alternative to DMV-issued photo IDs….**With race data in hand, the legislature amended the bill to exclude many of the alternative photo IDs used by African Americans. As amended, the bill retained only the kinds of IDs that white North Carolinians were more likely to possess**.



&gt;….Legislators also requested data as to the racial breakdown of early voting usage….**The racial data provided to the legislators revealed that African Americans disproportionately used early voting in both 2008 and 2012….After receipt of this racial data, the General Assembly amended the bill to eliminate the first week of early voting.**




&gt;**….Legislators similarly requested data as to the racial makeup of same-day registrants….SL 2013-381 eliminated same-day registration….Legislators additionally requested a racial breakdown of provisional voting….With SL 2013-381, the General Assembly altogether eliminated out-of-precinct voting….African Americans also disproportionately used preregistration…. Although preregistration increased turnout among young adult voters, SL 2013-381 eliminated it.**




&gt;….As “evidence of justifications” for the changes to early voting, the State offered purported inconsistencies in voting hours across counties, including the fact that only some counties had decided to offer Sunday voting. **The State then elaborated on its justification, explaining that “[c]ounties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black” and “disproportionately Democratic.”**





&gt;**It’s not just that every provision coincidentally happens to affect blacks disproportionately. In at least a couple of cases, provisions were added only after the legislature had racial breakdowns in hand so they could make sure they weren’t accidentally targeting whites too.**




The aim of Republicans is very clear. You can claim they weren't successful, but it wasn't from a lack of trying if they weren't

[],-Trimurti-,,,[],,,,text,t2_3o7b0qzr,False,,"&gt;I still don‘t think that there is a sufficient amount of scientific data suggesting that the human brain works that way.

You are correct without my having to prove it - and I hope you shall be happy in that ascertation. No - science cannot penetrate the veil of the brain (or consciousness).

&gt;I meant to say there is a scientifical [sic] reason

You're not getting the underlying point here. Science is an approximate; if you believe what science dictates you are robbed from seeing what it *actually is* as pay for that by being told what it is. So - of course science can't explain it because science can't really explain it - it can *approximate* it. But with that being said, all final instances of the results are snap decision of quantum action as far as we're concerned and can prove - so pick one.

&gt;A fact is something that is unreasonable to believe otherwise based on the current scientific data.

Scientific data again. We're not seeing eye to eye here and I cannot possibly explain enough in this space (without you doing some of the reading already mentioned) for me to be able to have a conversation about why this is absolutely *bollocks*. You fell right into the trap and I may address it tomorrow if you reply to this.

&gt;Well yes, the emotion came first (chronologically) but just because it occurred  earlier, doesn't necessitate that the rational thought process is logically based on or influenced by that emotion or that it happens to explain the emotion. 

So - why would you think through an emotion that didn't exist? It would have to exist *in order for you to think about it*.

&gt;I think that there is an objective reality that we subjectively perceive. So it is different for everyone, but there is still an objective truth and some people are closer to it than others. Science exists for the purpose of coming closer to that objective truth.

I agree that ""objective reality"" is being percieved subjectively and so it is different for everyone - we agree on that absolutely. I don't feel that science can bring us to an objective truth for the reason that the objective truth is *shared* and 'The Truth' is always subjective. We can talk about this, but it'll deviate - fair warning.

&gt;Oh, so you want to go back to the times when the plague was ravaging through europe and people whipped themselves in order to cure it because they thought they had somehow angered god and the plague was his punishment? They were pretty far away from the objective truth from today's perspective.

I understand what you're getting at - but no - I *don't want* that happening again. Interestingly this next point you made is *really* juicy though:

&gt;Sure, we still have our problems, but all in all there has never been a time where humans have lived as comfortable as they do today. And that is taking all of humanity into account, including the poorest countries and regions.

Hard times make strong people, strong people make easy times, easy times make weak people, weak people make hard times. Get back to me when you've read enough history and you'll see the vibration and pattern of human interaction with knowledge more properly.

So you've got into it on Hitler. I'm just not going to respond, because I don't think it's worth my time. That being said if you really want to push it and fight those points we could get into it and I could quote you (from my library) a lot of direct, factual, sourced information that would cause some real problems to what you've put forwards. So I'm going to sidestep this and leave you to what I've already put out.

I will say this - you are close to understanding the link between science and statement, of fact and reason etc. (with regards to ""fake science"") I'd just rather you grasp it without me putting it down your throat.

The numbers are real fishy.

&gt;But there is widespread scepticism about the official estimates, which were abruptly raised without explanation from 170 billion barrels in 1987 to 260 billion in 1989 (tmsnrt.rs/29fzTm3).

&gt;Official reserves have remained constant every year since then at 260-265 billion barrels, even as the country has consumed or exported another 94 billion barrels (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2016).

&gt;If the government data is accurate, the kingdom has managed the remarkable feat of exactly replacing each produced barrel with new discoveries or increased estimates of the amount recoverable from existing fields.

&gt;But most of the country’s giant and super-giant oil fields were discovered between 1936 and 1970 and no comparable discoveries have been made since then.

&gt;The implied increase in reserves must therefore come from enhanced estimates of the amount of oil recoverable from existing reservoirs.

&gt;The problem is that field-by-field production profiles and reserve estimates are state secrets known by only a small group of insiders, making it impossible to test or verify them.

There's a link to the study in the article. 

Canada (and other countries) has a bunch as well. There are countless studies showing that the studies commissioned and executed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are faulty, at the best, and downright improperly conducted, at the worst. Remember,  the IPCC has a mandate to FIND that climate change is an issue. They are NOT there to study and determine IF it is. The conclusion has already been decided.

Another one: The famous Hockey Stick chart of the 90s that really propelled this whole global warming thing (now simply climate change or climate uncertainty) is a downright lie. A Canadian scientist sued for the raw data after trying to replicate the results. (That's how science works. If you can't replicate the results, the original study is dismissable). It has been 8+ years on court and the original scientist refuses to divulge his data.... once again, that is the antithesis of how science works. Google Mann vs Ball.

Last point: results. Almost every climate study makes a prediction, yet not one prediction has come to pass. 

Kilimanjaro has lost NO snow. Sea rise has not happened. Islands have not disappeared. Ice sheets are lost in one area and gained in another...like it has happened for millennia. Temp increase, despite that the news tells us, has not increased. You have hot days and not so hot days; cold winters and warm winters; etc. 

Honestly, remember the absolutely dire consequences they said we'd face? Name 1 of them that has come to pass. 

This has turned into a rant a bit...and I didnt mean for that to happen but I'll just add one thing. I invest in real estate... real estate/real property/land is the most stable and coveted of investments. The amount of data and information banks and investors commission will amaze you. That said, look at the properties some of the most vocal climate change promoters are buying.

Obama: just bought a coastal property   
Gore: has lived in one for 15+ years while telling us we will lose our shores by 2015  
Investors: beach front condos, New York, Cali, Florida, Mexican resorts.and not just north America. All the big investments are on picturesque shorelines in Europe and Asia.

Time and time again experts recommended policy changes of increased immigration and to a lesser effect ending sexism in the workplace, but Japanese leadership was unyielding and instead focused on monetary policy and hopes the technological lead of the 70s and 80s would manifest again. It didn't. In the 80's and 90s, my dad would only buy Japanese consumer tech, save for computers. Today, save for cars, neither my father or I own any Japanese brands. And with the Japanese gambling big on hydrogen instead of all-electric, it looks like they will eventually lose their primacy in cars. Korea usurped them in consumer tech, and in the decades to come China should eventually usurp both. This economic backdrop for a country that lives on export manufacturing is not a good one. Not to mention the rising exports from Southeasten Asian countries and India. There are people here in Tennessee who use Mahindra tractors on their farms - Mahindra is an Indian company. Never thought I'd see that.

Japan will have to make radical changes to their society, which involves massive immigration just to stay afloat, and that is just not happening with an insular, xenophobic culture. Because of the rapidly aging workforce, more and more educated women will be needed in the workforce, and that is not conducive to a birth rate explosion, but instead the opposite, no matter what incentives the Japanese govt will provide.

For example it is more difficult to poll mobile phones than landlines, but there are substantial demographic differences between mobile phone only people and landline only people.

[],eric_he,,,[],,,,text,t2_9fh9lii,False,[],"Well an idea commonly suggested here is that China is taking all sorts of biometrics data from prisoners of conscience and the Uyghur population. Then as demand arises they see which people in their concentration camp have the appropriate organs and kill them off without any sort of due process to begin with. And of course people shrug their shoulders, distance themselves from the people being murdered, and think instead about the lives being saved.

Thats why the issue of punishing criminals should be separated from the goal of saving lives; linking the two creates a feedback loop with extremely questionable incentives where the system itself becomes rotten. OTOH, No doctor is ever going to intentionally kill off a patient in a quest to save lives.

Preventing this feedback loop necessitates wasting the organs of the executed. *The whole point of executions is that they should be wasteful and done with great deliberation.* That’s why millions of dollars are spent on appeals and hearings before any execution is performed here in the United States, more money than it costs to imprison them for life! Thinking about how to turn a profit from dispensing of criminals runs directly contrary to the established sentiment that society must be willing to sacrifice significant resources to kill people off.

Edit: in the case where there is only one criminal ever, you’re correct that organ harvesting is fine! But real life is a case of repeated games (ie we must deal with more than one criminal), and in the case of repeated games we have to think about this feedback loop. Hence your starting premise (that the prisoner is already on death row) trivially makes your original argument correct because it reduces the problem to the case of one game/one prisoner, but the premise itself is really missing the big picture view of what factors are considered by our justice system, which deals with the repeated games case.",1569798389,{},f1xhghn,False,t3_daiysm,False,True,t1_f1wv1xj,/r/worldnews/comments/daiysm/china_harvesting_organs_of_uighur_muslims_the/f1xhghn/,1569808854.0,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0.0,1569799098.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This entire problem is a result of us making the internet more and more accessible to people who truly do not understand what it is they are using.

The result is what I tend to end up calling 'siloing.'

The internet is great at helping you find what you want, [but it puts you there and then essentially keeps you there](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) - we are currently in a situation where that has gotten further along.

Every single person they have disagreed with along the way they have kicked out to the point that it is just an echo chamber of opinions, which has resulted in escalations of their feelings and beliefs as there is no one to tell them otherwise - those people were kicked out long ago.

It is pretty dangerous, the fact that these people are just sitting out there in these groups together with no input from the outside world. Then people like [Steve Bannon comes through and starts targeting them for voting blocks.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/18/steve-bannon-learned-harness-troll-army-world-warcraft/489713001/)

[Filter bubbles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) is part of what I am talking about. But this is beyond that, this is social networks and groups inside of them isolating them further beyond just what your search filters show you. This is removing anything from their world that disagrees with their current reality that they have built and ignoring things in front of their faces to do so.

This is effectively a feedback loop of the worst kind - hate, anger, and fear are what motivates them and they all pat each other on the back when these things are discussed. They are normalizing those patterns of behavior as their norm.

The fact that they started to get there through filter bubbles makes sense, but they congregated into places and formed groups and kicked out anyone who didn't fit their reality and then kept moving forward for years. This is beyond search filters at this point and into the realm of social blocks that he is targeting by going into those areas and influencing them through more fear and more hate and more anger for his agenda.

Filter bubbles can put you into a search engine loop, actively ignoring and dismissing reality to justify your search engine loop is a behavioral problem, an education problem, and a problem with being able to sanity check information online - not just a search engine problem (At least IMO)

Here's my take: Odds are very good the House votes to impeach before the end of the year- probably even before Thanksgiving.

Yeah, yeah- that's not exactly Nostrodamus-level prognostication.

The really big question right now, which no one- including me- knows the answer to: Where does the Senate land in all this?

Right now the prevailing wisdom is that the Senate either simply won't hold a trial because McConnell would subvert the Constitution like he did with Obama's SC nominee, or that the Senate would simply hold the trial, then would not vote to convict.

But... and this is where we get into speculation- there are cracks showing in the GOP facade. There's a lot of Republicans who have quietly disapproving of Trump while publicly voting with him and toeing the Trump line... until this last week.

Some Republicans of both greater and lesser notoriety in their party have begun making noises that either signal tacit or even overt support for the House impeachment inquiry. There's been allegations that about 35 Senators would vote to impeach if the vote was secret.

This leads one to believe that the GOP is no longer firmly united behind Trump. The key will be what happens in the GOP rank and file over the next week or two, as more information comes out and the House holds more hearings. The GOP base isn't a monobloc and while there's a solid core of Trump supporters who will never abandon their racist, fascist wank fantasy, there's others who aren't quite as hidebound.

In the end, the GOP will go where their voters go. If support for Trump softens, the GOP will fold like a cheap suit and burn the Trump administration to the waterline if it means saving their political fortunes, or minimizing their losses in the wake of Trump being shown in stark detail for what he is, in a way that can't be denied or deflected.

What says to me that this scenario is more likely than not is that the Trump surrogates in the media have lost control of the narrative. They keep trying their old playbook and it just keeps dying on them. The media isn't playing along and more who were ambivalent in the past are leveling more pointed criticism by the day.

And Trump himself is showing signs of fear, if not abject terror. His tweets and public appearances are getting even more bugfuck, and his lickspittle surrogates like Giuliani can't seem to keep from stepping on their dick.

It's getting very interesting now, and I think we're moving toward an inevitable clash.

[],PeelerNo44,,,[],,,,text,t2_hbhx1,False,[],"Sure, investigative organizations under the US Federal government investigate stuff.  I can see that you're a big fan of investigations which uncover oral sexes in certain offices.  That is the specificity of that particular instance; no one playing the role of president, with sound mind, would be interested in being investigated during their term, regardless of innocence or guilt, as it would greatly hamper their ability to execute the responsibilities of their office.  For the record, I'm against sketchy investigations under Hoover, and I question the Constitutional legitimacy or having such organizations in the first place; I am not the voice of the U.S.A. though.  As far as I am aware, the criminal implications within the Mueller report were explicitly directed at the president and involved his actions to end that investigation as quickly as possible--since the investigation was allowed to continue, seemingly indefinitely, if no evidence was found that directly implicated the president in operating with foreign agents in a coordinated effort to undermine USA elections, then it seems reasonable he, the president (referring specifically to the office rather than the current individual occupying it), would be interested, and arguably should be, active in closing such an investigation as quickly as possible.  I consider this even further with the odd details surrounding this specific events, such as FBI agents sending text messages that certain individuals will be stopped from becoming president, demonstrating clear political biases.

At least one of the counts of obstruction within the Mueller report, as far as I am aware and feel free to correct me if I am incorrect, is the president's decision to fire an individual within the government in order to prevent the investigation from occurring.  There isn't clear precedent that that's a crime--the organizations we're discussing operate within the executive branch of the federal government, of which the president is the head of that branch, which allows him the power and authority over under the U.S. Constitution.  Such firings are Constitutional, where as such investigations are not specifically Constitutional.

It also is a far-fetched idea that the president is the same as any other individual, while holding the responsibility of that office.  Again, even the Constitution clearly defines specific parameters concerning the president which do not apply to average citizens--or else they wouldn't require specification.  Under the Constitution, and even by reason of rationalization, it is necessary that different roles be treated differently; this isn't necessarily fair, and perhaps presidents now or in the past have enjoyed such privileges in an abusive manner, but the differentiation to some degree is quite necessary.  This is especially true in a global landscape unforseen by the Constitution with nuclear weapons, as the president becomes the de facto decider of nuclear launches as the commander and chief in matters of war.

I didn't address that because I am not aware of it.  From my perspective it looks like many individuals were interested in not only preventing Trump from becoming president, but also in removing him from office by all means necessary.  The Mueller investigation looks very much like an extension of that sentiment, and I imagine I'm not the only one who considered that possibility.  If someone isn't willing to reasonably consider that, not necessarily agree that that is the case, then I suspect that their focus is biased and will have trouble in convincing others that that is in fact not the case.  Perhaps the Mueller investigation wasn't an investigation to soft coup the president, but disregarding that as a potential possibility disallows explaining how and why that isn't actually the case.

So if it was in bad faith for me to discuss instances where the president was accused of obstruction in cases that didn't involve him (surely the president cannot pardon individuals convicted of crimes by courts, or order investigations under the executive branch to be stopped), then I confess that I wasn't aware that that was a specific point of interest in our discussion.  I did ask what your considerations were in the specific instances of obstruction, that I might better learn your perspective and information surrounding these specific counts of obstruction.  The fact that you didn't doesn't reek of bad faith to me though; what I asked for was both personal and a lot to ask for someone to explain; furthermore, you did provide me with a link about them, but I have yet to read that.  You can consider me lazy on that end, though I might make up excuses like my lack of free time due to an excessive work load to wade through large volumes of organized data on the interwebs--even that being the case, I know it's an excuse, and you could rightly and fairly call it that.  I wouldn't agree that I'm acting in bad faith though, as my intention is to have an honest discussion about these subjects with other individuals in a somewhat intimate manner.

That's fair, you didn't say it was the best evidence for impeachment--I get the impression many people did at the time, and what I do know about it seems like it's a stretch (perhaps a reasonable one) to equate these obstruction accusations with crimes or impeachable offenses.  I am a bit wary that someone might suggest a sitting president be exorcised from office in such a short period of time after being elected, as suggested it seems by your statement; however, I admit the current USA president is not generally comparable to the normal of past presidents, including the election which put him there--depending what specific points you were alluding to, I might find it reasonable that a Constitutional legislative branch would have impeached him much sooner.  It does, however, come across that you are biased against the individual--I do not say this as a negative against you, nor as a means to prove you are absolutely incorrect, but rather as a suggestion that if your aim is ever to help others draw similar conclusions to your own, it may be more profitable to operate in as non-biased a manner as you may.  You were being honest though, and I appreciate that, and you are not necessarily wrong in your thinking.  

I think it's beyond fair for you to state that a president that outright commits crimes is a legitimate target for impeachment; though I said the role of the president is defined differently than your average citizen, the intention of the Constitution does not appear to be that the president have free reign to operate with criminal intent, especially not against the Americans.  

However, I think we've established that we may disagree what constitutes obstruction within the purview of the president--presidents of USA can and have altered investigations, as well as, processes by which the law is executed; that's kind of the point of the executive branch.  Had Bill Clinton did something similar with the investigation into his private life, I'd feel the same way, though arguably the other party may have played the obstruction card as well.  If the evidence for the suspicion which created the need for the environment been so apparent and damning though, I feel there's a possibility it would rise to public knowledge regardless of investigations--investigations are not the determining factors for guilt of a crime, but rather evidence is, and it's very important that that is where the distinction lies under that law.  In this case, the Mueller investigation, it appears more like drawing the cart before the horse--the investigation proves the president is guilty, so any action against the investigation double proves the guilt, regardless of any evidence discovered by the investigation.  I think you've failed to convince me that obstruction crimes were committed and well laid out within the Mueller report.  If they were so well laid out, it seems it might be simple to give a summary about them and how clear cut it is against the president.

Perhaps this Ukraine stuff may be more clear cut, as crimes under US law.  I read something about government information being moved to private servers recently, and as far as I am aware, that actually is now explicitly against the law, after Hillary Clinton did it.  I didn't like it when Hillary did it, though someone pointed out to me it was not explicitly illegal at that time, but as far as I am aware it actually is now.  So I'm not happy with Trump doing it either, and that seems a far more clear cut avenue toward impeachment, as well as, a clear precedent for something elected officials and government employees should not do.  We'll see how this plays out.

WRONG. If you had maybe listened to what the right was saying in 2016, the issue was with the security of her server and the question of whether that was intentional so foreign bodies could access information for cash or other quid pro quo. There was also several proven instances of storing the highest classification of data on those servers and having people that were not given classification, accessing the server. 

It’s all in the emails (well, what she didn’t totally destroy). Maybe you can have a better perspective on why we were all whipped up in a frenzy now. And of course Comey even came out and said she was guilty but that “no reasonable prosecutor” would do anything (because she’s Hillary Clinton and above the law). 

Yeah, there’s a lot she was hiding - but the issue wasn’t about what she was hiding on her server. That’s totally inaccurate. 

&gt;trying to hide information 

The request was for the President to work with Barr, who has publicly stated that he is investigating the origins of the Russia Probe. The call was sensitive in nature because it involves an ongoing investigation of several formerly high ranking members of the government. They were also aware of CIA spying (the “whistleblower”, if we can even call him that since he had no first hand knowledge, was CIA).

Exhaustive list of pathologies that Ranked Choice Voting solves in our electoral system:

1. Voting for a hopeless candidate hurts candidates who aren't hopeless who the voter would agree with mostly and helps candidates who aren't helpless who the voter would disagree with mostly. (What people think of when they image a 'spoiler effect', though not quite the whole story)
2. It's possible for the worst candidate to win due to vote splitting.

Basically, RCV prevents Florida 2000 scenarios where a small group of voters voting for a candidate with a tiny minority of people's support throws the election to the wrong candidate from the two major parties.

That's about all it does though, and what people want out of voting reform is much more expansive usually.

Inexhaustive list of pathologies that Ranked Choice Voting doesn't solve in our electoral system (that are already part of the current system):

1. Giving candidate A a certain level of support is mutually exclusive with giving candidate B that same level of support. This is ultimately the root of most problems in our voting system and systems that don't address this can fix some of its symptoms but not the root cause. (Systems that don't have this problem are known as *cardinal* systems)
2. Mutually exclusive support means candidates are incentivized to portray their opponents in a negative light to ensure they be ranked above them.
3. Candidates are incentivized to spend enormous sums of money convincing voters that they deserve to be ranked above other candidates.
4. The presence of two ideologically similar candidates in a race can still cause both of them to lose when if only one of them was in the race they would have won - meaning that there still is a form of the spoiler effect (though it works somewhat differently and comes into play in more specific conditions in ranked choice voting - namely when, of two candidates A and B of ideologically X, A is more popular with voters of ideology X but less popular with voters of ideology Y compared to B, to the point where B is eliminated prior to the final round of voting but would have gotten more votes in the final round than A).
4. Due to the spoiler effect, voters are incentivized to dishonestly say that they prefer candidate with a stronger chance of winning X compared to candidate that they like more but has a smaller chance of winning Y.
5. Due to the spoiler effect, political primaries are forced to use primary elections to ensure they only have one ideologically similar candidate in a general election.
6. The opinions of everyone who ranked candidates of ideology B over candidates of ideology A are ignored (eg if 51% of voters rank the republican above the democrat and 49% of voters rank the democrat above the republican, the 49% of voters had no impact on the result and their voices are ignored).
7. Candidates are incentivized to focus their campaigns on wedge issues where they disagree with their opponents (and thus can draw support away from them) rather than on consensus issues that most everyone (including their opponents) agrees on. This results in these consensus issues taking a backseat to wedge issues in candidates' agendas once elected.
8. Focus on wedge issues results in elected officials frequently enacting one policy towards them before being voted out and elected officials from the other side undoing those policies - this is inefficient.
9. Focus on wedge issues polarizes voters into two groups, leading to voters filtering themselves into media bubbles that frequently miss the big picture.
10. The spoiler effect results in most rational voters sorting themselves between one of the two main parties, leaving mostly those who view both main parties as being equally bad to form the membership of third parties. This results in ideologically extreme third parties that alienate most voters.

Ranked Choice Voting doesn't do much to solve any of these issues. It also introduces some new issues of its own:

1. Contrary to almost all other single winner voting systems, ranked choice voting is not precinct summable - you have to have all the ballots in one central location to count them, rather than letting precincts sum their own results and send those results to the central location for further summing. This is a non-trivial expense and security liability.
2. Ranked Choice Voting can create extreme spoiler-effect scenarios where it's better to not vote at all than it is to vote honestly. (This is known as a No-Show Paradox)
3. Ranked Choice Voting can create bizarre scenarios where a winning candidate can be made a loser by gaining support, or a losing candidate can be made a winner by losing support. (This is known as non-monotonicity)

Here's an example scenario that demonstrates these issues. After eliminating the non-top 3 candidates, vote totals stand as follows:

Voters | Rank Order
---|---
26.6% | Progressive &gt; Moderate &gt; Conservative
1.4% | Progressive &gt; Conservative &gt; Moderate
21.6% | Moderate &gt; Green &gt; Conservative
5.4% | Moderate &gt; Conservative &gt; Progressive
45% | Conservative &gt; Moderate &gt; Progressive

The Moderate is eliminated, 27% to 28%, to the Progressive candidate. The Progressive candidate advances to the final round and loses to the Conservative, 49.6%-50.4%. Note that the Moderate would have beaten the Conservative 53.6%-46.4%.

However:

* If a single percentage point of P&gt;M&gt;C voters dishonestly voted M&gt;P&gt;C, the Liberal would advance to the final round and beat the Conservative 53.6%-46.4%. This means that the Progressive is a spoiler, since they're a losing candidate that helps their voters least favorite win. Progressive voters are incentivized to lie on the ballot and say they prefer the Moderate, betraying their favorite.
* No-Show Paradox: If two percentage points of PMC voters don't vote at all, then the Moderate advances to the final round and beats the Conservative 52.7% - 47.3%. Not voting is literally a better strategy than voting honestly for PMC voters.
* Non-monotonicity: If the 1.4% PCM voters decide the Conservative is better than the Progressive candidate and vote CPM instead, then the Moderate advances to the final round and beats the Conservative 53.6%-46.4%. A shift in support toward the Conservative from the wrong voters can cause the Conservative to lose.

This means voting for your favorite candidate can still be riskier than voting for a more universally liked moderate candidate in Ranked Choice Voting, and probably means that we're still left with a two party system. This is backed by the results of elections in Australia, which has used RCV in their house elections for 100 years. 97% of the Australian House is still controlled by one of the main two parties* and the number of third party members in the 150 member house hasn't risen above the single digits since the great depression.

^(*The Liberal and National parties in Australia have been in coalition for 70 consecutive years, rarely contest the same elections, and thus are functionally the same party even if they aren't nominally. Liberals are 29.3% of the Australian house, Nationals are 9.7% of the house, and an additional 14.7% of the house are liberal-nationals from Queensland, where the two parties have fused completely).

So what are the alternative systems that don't have these weaknesses?

* Approval voting is a simple improvement over one-choice plurality/FPTP that simply allows voters to vote for multiple candidates for the same office. It's less expressive than RCV but vastly simpler and cheaper to implement.
* Score voting is a somewhat more complex system: voters rate each candidate that they have an opinion about from 1-10. These ratings are summed, and the candidate with the highest total is the winner. This retains most of approval voting's strengths while also being more expressive than ranked choice voting (since you can say that you like two candidates equally, or enumerate how much more you like your second favorite candidate compared to your third favorite candidate). Note that score voting with a scale of 1-2 is basically the same as approval voting, and if voters strategically choose to ignore the numbers between 1-10 (eg only give candidates either a 1 or a 10) then Score voting becomes approval voting.
* **S**core **T**hen **A**utomatic **R**unoff (STAR) Voting is a variation of score voting that adds a final step to elect the candidate out of the top 2 most scored candidates who's preferred by a simple majority of voters. This probably gives worse results with mostly honest voters but may be more resistant to strategy than Score voting.

Established theory and simulations shows that all of these systems should far outperform ranked choice voting in every conceivable election scenario, though real world data from high stakes elections is lacking - most places in the world use multi-winner elections and most single-winner elections are still ran either with choose one plurality or choose one plurality then runoff. Fargo, ND enacted approval voting last year and there are ongoing campaigns in St. Louis, MO for approval and Lane County, Oregon for STAR right now but other than that current political use is near-nonexistant. Increased momentum for RCV over the last few years isn't helping there - people tend to assume that if you're against RCV you're attacking it from the right and they stop listening to you, or they view the momentum of RCV as not worth going against even if it means not fixing nearly as much - as a state house member here in Utah that I talked to a few months ago said.",1569536514,{},f1kjurk,False,t3_d9oxf1,False,True,t1_f1k5nl4,/r/politics/comments/d9oxf1/rep_raskin_house_democrats_introduce_ranked/f1kjurk/,1569537538.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#History
&gt; FNC was created by Australian born American media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former Republican political consultant [Roger Ailes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ailes) is the founding CEO. Roger Ailes was forced to resign in 2016 amid multiple accusations of sexual harassment. 

&gt; As of October 2018, Fox News has added to their terms of use that they are an [entertainment company](https://www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use): “Company furnishes the Company Sites and the Company Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment.”

#Analysis

&gt; According to a Pew Research Center [survey](http://www.journalism.org/2017/01/18/trump-clinton-voters-divided-in-their-main-source-for-election-news/) “Fox News was the main source for 40% of Trump voters” during the 2016 election. Further, another Pew [Survey](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/) indicates “When it comes to choosing a media source for political news, conservatives orient strongly around Fox News. Nearly half of consistent conservatives (47%) name it as their main source for government and political news.”  

&gt; Fox News typically looks at the issues from a conservative perspective and also has a number of on air personalities that are strong supporters of Trump, such as [Sean Hannity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity), [Tucker Carlson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson), [Laura Ingraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham), and [Tomi Lahren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomi_Lahren). FNC typically skews conservative as there is less criticism of Trump, therefore the majority of stories are pro-Trump.

&gt; When it comes to sourcing they typically utilize pro-Trump pundits such as Rush Limbaugh who has a [very poor record](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/) with fact checkers, as well as credible sources such as the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). Fox News is also known to publish [right wing conspiracy theories](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/business/fox-news-seth-rich-lawsuit.html), although after being sued they retracted the story. FNC has also been deemed the [least accurate](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jan/29/punditfact-checks-cable-news-channels/) cable news source according to [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/).

&gt; A factual search reveals several failed fact checks by hosts.

&gt; - [Says John Bolton “fundamentally was a man of the left.”](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/sep/13/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-falsely-claims-john-bolton-was-man-/) – PANTS OF FIRE

&gt; - [“The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country.”](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/26/sean-hannity/250000-syrian-refugees-us-fact-check-trump-hannity/) – PANTS ON FIRE

&gt; - [“Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns.”](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/15/tucker-carlson/carlson-guns-dont-kill-people-bathtubs-do/) – PANTS ON FIRE

&gt; - [“NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming.”](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/25/steve-doocy/foxs-doocy-nasa-fudged-data-make-case-global-warmi/) – PANTS ON FIRE

&gt; - [Obamacare is “one big fat VA system.”](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/22/kimberly-guilfoyle/guilfoyle-obamacare-one-big-fat-va/) – PANTS ON FIRE

#Conclusion
&gt; Overall, we rate Fox News strongly Right-Biased due to editorial positions and story selection that favors the right. We also rate them Mixed factually based on poor sourcing and the spreading of conspiracy theories that later must be retracted after being widely shared. Further, Fox News would be rated a Questionable source based on numerous failed fact checks by hosts and pundits, however straight news reporting is generally reliable, therefore we rate them Mixed for factual reporting.

Why is it that every single prediction of doom and gloom that has been made in modern history about the big bad climate monster has been completely wrong and unfounded?

&gt;
&gt;Some of his other new world order views:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thiel has become a national figure of controversy for, among other things, claiming that “the extension of the franchise to women **[women's right to vote] render the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,”** saying, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” funding a fellowship that specifically tries to get undergraduates to drop out of college, and donating $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s campaign a week after a tape was released in which the then-candidate discussed how he could grope young female actresses and get away with it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thiel was long perceived as a libertarian, but in recent years, as his support for Trump illustrates, his politics have taken a nationalist flavor that critics have described as bordering on **authoritarian** and white nationalist.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In Oct. 2016, shortly after Thiel donated $1.25 million to Trump, Thiel publicly apologized for passages in his 1995 book The Diversity Myth, such as claiming that some alleged date rapes were “seductions that are later regretted,” ... But three months later, during the after party of the 30-year anniversary event at Thiel’s home, Thiel stated that his apology was just for the media, and that “sometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear.”

&gt;The Republican Koch family billions:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;David and Charles Koch, the fabulously rich brothers who turned an oil and manufacturing empire inherited from their father into a cash cow for rightwing causes
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Even in his 20s, David Koch was attending a “Freedom School” where he learnt about “anarcho-capitalism” and the virtues of small government and abolishing taxes. Low taxes would be personally appealing to someone with a vast and growing fortune like his.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So too would **countering any effort to penalize toxic corporations in the fight against climate change**. By Greenpeace’s reckoning, in the 20 years to 2017, **the Kochs ploughed about $127m into 92 groups that were involved in rebuffing climate crisis solutions.**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;“David Koch won’t live to see the worst of climate change but the legacy of denial and the intensified delay caused by his funding will live on,” said Kert Davies, director of the Climate Investigation Center.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Through AFP, the Kochs spawned a nationwide web of impassioned conservative volunteers, empowered by the new voter technology they supported through the political data firm i360. Among the key targets of their campaigning: the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which brought healthcare to millions of Americans but which the Kochs saw as big government interference. **But it also took on climate crisis regulations, public education and taxes and championed the nascent 2010 Tea Party movement.**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;“A substantial part of David Koch’s legacy was the utter distortion of American democracy, which should be based on one person, one vote but was grossly twisted when he used his vast wealth to buy himself an influence that was out of all proportion.”
&gt;
&gt;&gt;(it is well known that the Koch brothers support Republican candidates, but it is less well known that over two decades they spent not a single dime on any Democrat.)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Take Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which **cost $1.5 trillion to the benefit of the rich above all others. The cuts follow a script very similar to the plan put forward by the Koch brothers – which helps explain why they went on to spend more than $20m promoting the legislation.**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Koch Industries can also claim the distinction of being one of the country’s most highly polluting companies,** behind only ExxonMobil and American Electric Power.

&gt;Billionaire Robert Mercer, best known for funding Steve Bannon, [Breitbart](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a52141/wildest-breitbart-headlines/), [Project Veritas](https://www.thedailybeast.com/erik-prince-set-up-intel-training-for-project-veritas-james-okeefe-report), and [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/facebook-cambridge-analytica-joseph-chancellor-gsr), which is in the Russia collusion investigation in addition to [corrupting several elections around the world](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/03/what-was-cambridge-analytica-doing-in-developing-countries.html) to the point that [one country's supreme court had to nullify the elections that Mercer's groups interfered in](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/africa/kenya-cambridge-analytica-election.html):
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Bob Mercer has accepted is **that climate change is not happening. It's not for real, and if it is happening, it's going to be good for the planet**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Among other things, Mercer said the United States went in the wrong direction after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and also insisted the only remaining racists in the United States were African-Americans, according to Magerman.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;they believe that nuclear war is really not such a big deal. And they've actually argued that outside of the immediate blast zone in Japan during World War II - outside of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - that the radiation was actually good for the Japanese. **So they see a kind of a silver lining in nuclear war and nuclear accidents.** Bob Mercer has certainly embraced the view that radiation could be good for human health - low level radiation.

&gt;
&gt;Some of his other new world order views:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thiel has become a national figure of controversy for, among other things, claiming that “the extension of the franchise to women **[women's right to vote] render the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,”** saying, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” funding a fellowship that specifically tries to get undergraduates to drop out of college, and donating $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s campaign a week after a tape was released in which the then-candidate discussed how he could grope young female actresses and get away with it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thiel was long perceived as a libertarian, but in recent years, as his support for Trump illustrates, his politics have taken a nationalist flavor that critics have described as bordering on **authoritarian** and white nationalist.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In Oct. 2016, shortly after Thiel donated $1.25 million to Trump, Thiel publicly apologized for passages in his 1995 book The Diversity Myth, such as claiming that some alleged date rapes were “seductions that are later regretted,” ... But three months later, during the after party of the 30-year anniversary event at Thiel’s home, Thiel stated that his apology was just for the media, and that “sometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear.”

&gt;
&gt;The Republican Koch family billions:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;David and Charles Koch, the fabulously rich brothers who turned an oil and manufacturing empire inherited from their father into a cash cow for rightwing causes
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Even in his 20s, David Koch was attending a “Freedom School” where he learnt about “anarcho-capitalism” and the virtues of small government and abolishing taxes. Low taxes would be personally appealing to someone with a vast and growing fortune like his.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So too would **countering any effort to penalize toxic corporations in the fight against climate change**. By Greenpeace’s reckoning, in the 20 years to 2017, **the Kochs ploughed about $127m into 92 groups that were involved in rebuffing climate crisis solutions.**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;“David Koch won’t live to see the worst of climate change but the legacy of denial and the intensified delay caused by his funding will live on,” said Kert Davies, director of the Climate Investigation Center.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Through AFP, the Kochs spawned a nationwide web of impassioned conservative volunteers, empowered by the new voter technology they supported through the political data firm i360. Among the key targets of their campaigning: the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which brought healthcare to millions of Americans but which the Kochs saw as big government interference. **But it also took on climate crisis regulations, public education and taxes and championed the nascent 2010 Tea Party movement.**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;“A substantial part of David Koch’s legacy was the utter distortion of American democracy, which should be based on one person, one vote but was grossly twisted when he used his vast wealth to buy himself an influence that was out of all proportion.”
&gt;
&gt;&gt;(it is well known that the Koch brothers support Republican candidates, but it is less well known that over two decades they spent not a single dime on any Democrat.)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Take Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which **cost $1.5 trillion to the benefit of the rich above all others. The cuts follow a script very similar to the plan put forward by the Koch brothers – which helps explain why they went on to spend more than $20m promoting the legislation.**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Koch Industries can also claim the distinction of being one of the country’s most highly polluting companies,** behind only ExxonMobil and American Electric Power.

&gt; FNC was created by Australian born American media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former Republican political consultant [Roger Ailes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ailes) is the founding CEO. Roger Ailes was forced to resign in 2016 amid multiple accusations of sexual harassment. 

&gt; As of October 2018, Fox News has added to their terms of use that they are an [entertainment company](https://www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use): “Company furnishes the Company Sites and the Company Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment.”

&gt; **Analysis / Bias**

&gt; According to a Pew Research Center [survey](http://www.journalism.org/2017/01/18/trump-clinton-voters-divided-in-their-main-source-for-election-news/) “Fox News was the main source for 40% of Trump voters” during the 2016 election. Further, another Pew [Survey](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/) indicates “When it comes to choosing a media source for political news, conservatives orient strongly around Fox News. Nearly half of consistent conservatives (47%) name it as their main source for government and political news.”  

&gt; Fox News typically looks at the issues from a conservative perspective and also has a number of on air personalities that are strong supporters of Trump, such as [Sean Hannity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity), [Tucker Carlson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson), [Laura Ingraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham), and [Tomi Lahren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomi_Lahren). FNC typically skews conservative as there is less criticism of Trump, therefore the majority of stories are pro-Trump.

&gt; When it comes to sourcing they typically utilize pro-Trump pundits such as Rush Limbaugh who has a [very poor record](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/) with fact checkers, as well as credible sources such as the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). Fox News is also known to publish [right wing conspiracy theories](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/business/fox-news-seth-rich-lawsuit.html), although after being sued they retracted the story. FNC has also been deemed the [least accurate](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jan/29/punditfact-checks-cable-news-channels/) cable news source according to [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/).

&gt; A factual search reveals several failed fact checks by hosts.

&gt; - [Says John Bolton “fundamentally was a man of the left.”](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/sep/13/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-falsely-claims-john-bolton-was-man-/) – PANTS OF FIRE

&gt; - [“The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country.”](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/26/sean-hannity/250000-syrian-refugees-us-fact-check-trump-hannity/) – PANTS ON FIRE

&gt; - [“NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming.”](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/25/steve-doocy/foxs-doocy-nasa-fudged-data-make-case-global-warmi/) – PANTS ON FIRE

&gt; Overall, we rate Fox News strongly Right-Biased due to editorial positions and story selection that favors the right. We also rate them Mixed factually based on poor sourcing and the spreading of conspiracy theories that later must be retracted after being widely shared. Further, Fox News would be rated a Questionable source based on numerous failed fact checks by hosts and pundits, however straight news reporting is generally reliable, therefore we rate them Mixed for factual reporting.

&gt; Factual Reporting: MIXED

&gt; Country: USA

&gt; World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180

&gt; FNC was created by Australian born American media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former Republican political consultant [Roger Ailes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ailes) is the founding CEO. Roger Ailes was forced to resign in 2016 amid multiple accusations of sexual harassment. 

&gt; As of October 2018, Fox News has added to their terms of use that they are an [entertainment company](https://www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use): “Company furnishes the Company Sites and the Company Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment.”

&gt; **Analysis / Bias**

&gt; According to a Pew Research Center [survey](http://www.journalism.org/2017/01/18/trump-clinton-voters-divided-in-their-main-source-for-election-news/) “Fox News was the main source for 40% of Trump voters” during the 2016 election. Further, another Pew [Survey](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/) indicates “When it comes to choosing a media source for political news, conservatives orient strongly around Fox News. Nearly half of consistent conservatives (47%) name it as their main source for government and political news.”  

&gt; Fox News typically looks at the issues from a conservative perspective and also has a number of on air personalities that are strong supporters of Trump, such as [Sean Hannity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity), [Tucker Carlson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson), [Laura Ingraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham), and [Tomi Lahren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomi_Lahren). FNC typically skews conservative as there is less criticism of Trump, therefore the majority of stories are pro-Trump.

&gt; When it comes to sourcing they typically utilize pro-Trump pundits such as Rush Limbaugh who has a [very poor record](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/) with fact checkers, as well as credible sources such as the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). Fox News is also known to publish [right wing conspiracy theories](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/business/fox-news-seth-rich-lawsuit.html), although after being sued they retracted the story. FNC has also been deemed the [least accurate](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jan/29/punditfact-checks-cable-news-channels/) cable news source according to [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/).

Some things he is doing very uniquely well in. 
Polls also tend to consider likely voters based on historical data. (I.E. old people.) 2018 proved historical views on elections are not valid.

Yes, there is an emerging consensus or narrative that the democratic primary is going to come down to just Biden or Warren. I was trying to make the point that the media isn’t doing a good job of helping people understand the level of uncertainty in the data. The fact that Biden could very well finish in 3rd or 4th in California is a big deal, which is why I made my comment on this article. 

Take a look at what Harry Enten wrote about the Selzer poll in Iowa that just came out:

https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-iowa-poll-09-22-2019/index.html

“Someone in Biden's polling position should win about 25% of the time.
Someone at around 10%, like Buttigieg and Sanders, have about a 10% chance of winning.
Everyone else has less than a 10% chance of winning. Even Harris, who is at 6% in our poll, has something like a 7% chance of winning.
If you add up the top 5, their cumulative chance of winning is only between 80% and 85%. That means, there's still a 15% to 20% chance that someone not in the top 5 wins Iowa.
In other words, this race isn't over by any stretch.”

Source?

And you think this was what made Bernie lose?

&gt; leaking the debate questions to her beforehand

Donna Brazile leaked a question from CNN about water for a debate in Flint.  She also claims she [sent many things to Bernie](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/11/08/brazile_on_giving_hillary_debate_question_you_never_saw_the_things_i_gave_to_sanders_or_omalley.html), and that as a member of the DNC she simply wanted to make sure any Democrat candidates appeared as good as possible in any public settings.  CNN cut her off as a correspondent for this.  Even *if* Donna is lying, and you seem to trust her with the other article, I don't think there was material damage done to Sanders here.


&gt;  a backdoor deal promising Hillary direct DNC decision veto control in exchange for fundraising.


This is completely untrue.

First, Donna Brazile put this out in the most bombshell manner possible, and then within a few days, *retracted the way in which she presented it*.

Read later articles about that.  Even [Brazile walked back the claim](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/05/politics/donna-brazile-primary-rigged/index.html).  Further, all evidence (including leaked emails) basically shows that the DNC tried really hard to run a fair campaign.

Her claim in the book that the Clinton campaign had veto control of hires [was false](https://www.thedailybeast.com/theres-a-serious-hole-in-donna-braziles-new-book).  Please review this article.  The Clinton campaign was not consulted on hires.  Also, Sanders was given the opportunity to also sign the same joint financing agreement.


Unfortunately, Brazile released her claims in the most bombastic manner possible.  Everyone heard the claim, no one heard the walkback.


And Sanders supporters are in such a state of outrage- *egged on by propagandists* - that the correction is never heard, and the permanent state of outrage continues.


The reality is that the DNC did not materially affect the primary.  Clinton won off of name recognition.  **This is even shown in the data.**  Polling data was actually very reliable in 2016, despite popular opinion.  Polling data said Clinton would win by +4, with a margin of error of 3, which the media interpreted to mean Clinton would win the election.  Well, Clinton won the popular vote by +2, but lost the electoral college due to the placement of the votes.  FiveThirtyEight was the only big one pointing out that Clinton's margin of error allowed her to lose the election because of the state distributions.



Do you know what happens when an election is rigged?  When you use voter suppression to favor your candidate?  *They outperform polls*, because their voters were suppressed at the ballot box.

Well, if you apply this to the primary; *Sanders* outperformed his polling in outcomes.  (Not by enough margin to imply cheating, of course; and his outperformance is mostly explained by enthusiastic caucus attendees).



In other words;  the data doesn't show it was rigged, and the facts don't show it was rigged, and the leaked emails don't show it was rigged.  The DNC sabotaging Bernie is legitimately a conspiracy theory, rooted in some facts, that won't go away.",1569262923,{},f18sz1h,False,t3_d7s6rx,False,True,t1_f15awku,/r/politics/comments/d7s6rx/mike_pence_takes_eightvehicle_motorcade_across/f18sz1h/,1569264915.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],HawkFloyd,,,[],,,,text,t2_nqh2s,False,,"&gt;Boy I hope that's not true, as she adopted several of Bernie's policies like the $15 minimum wage, and had the most liberal Dem platform in recent memory, more liberal than Obama. That would suggest we go back to Clintonian Third Way centrism if voters reacted negatively to that.

Clinton's platform also didn't emphasize healthcare beyond saying ""build on what worked with Obamacare,"" which is a disastrous strategy. There was no large scale infrastructure program, no concern for the decline in America's manufacturing sector (she championed the TPP before eschewing it then appointing Ken Salazar to her transition team), and voters didn't trust her to get America out of wars she helped to start in the first place. 

&gt;It isn't Stein's fault, at least not too much her fault. It's her voters' fault. They're ultra-liberal and live in swing states. Their votes would've made the difference. And they still voted for some anti-vaccine kook who had no chance of winning, and ushered in Trump. Real sound strategy if you're a ""progressive"" - electing Bush and Trump. Wait, whose side are you on again?

Once again, Democrats would rather voter-shame than critically examine their own approach. 

&gt;Hillary had limited time and resources. She campaigned in the places that the stats said she should campaign. She didn't campaign in Wisconsin because literally every single public poll (and presumably private ones) showed her easily leading there. Sometimes by as much as 11 points. The last RCP average there before the election had her up by +7. She made a mistake trusting the data too much.

It's the same mistake she made in Michigan before getting clobbered by Bernie in the primary there. She should have learned, and she didn't. 

&gt;And Obama was center-left at best. Anyone paying attention beyond the slogan knew he wasn't a socialist or whatever. He was a center-left technocrat.

His messaging mattered, though. He spent the entire election encouraging people to think big. In the middle of a recession, he ostensibly argued for massive, structural change. Hillary spent the entire primary saying Bernie's ideas were too big, and by the time the AP announced her the nominee the day before the California primary, that was her image. ""I'm a progressive who likes to get things done"" and ""Single payer will never, ever come to pass"" aren't exactly voter-energizing rhetoric. 

&gt;Maybe progressives would actually see progressive policy implemented if they weren't constantly staying home or throwing their votes away on third parties and ushering in the fucking worst Republican presidents of the last several decades.

I agree, voter disenfranchisement is the biggest roadblock to progressive policy. Making Election Day a national holiday and running candidates actually interested in improving standards of living would put a nice dent in that problem.

&gt;I don't know how you call yourself a progressive while justifying your vote (or lack thereof) enabling the Bush/Trump presidencies. You've done more for the conservative movement than almost anyone.

The graph is first of all from AAA, which is an old people group.

Next, the graphs are equalized at 100m miles driven, which would automatically mean that the older you are the lower your graph because your timeline is longer than a younger driver. Which, shocker, also means that most people do the lionshare of their driving between age 30-69 which is also why the graphs for those age groups are the lowest.

That data basically only shows that between 16-19 most people learn how to drive, with lethality and accidents dropping hard after 20. Of course the most accidents happen when you're first learning. I'll bet rates for job accidents are also higher for people when they're starting out too. If you changed the driving age to 25, the stats would probably also show that between 23-26 was the worst drivers - because that's the age most people legally learn to drive. Doesn't mean that 25 year olds are idiots or worse than other age groups.

*Edit* Went ahead and looked at those graphs and they are also misleading because they don't even keep consistent X axis. It starts with 2 year groupings then goes to 4+ year groupings, with the graphs showing a major spike in the 16-17 area, with a big drop down at 18-19. Are 16 year olds more likely than 17 year olds, or is the number equal and that's why the ages are put together there? Most states issue Learner's Permits to 16 year olds, which makes sense that they'd have more accidents, *they're learning*. I think it might be more interesting to look at how likely someone is to be in an accident of all kinds with what age they got their permit. My guess would be that everyone is very likely to be in an accident in their first 2 years regardless of age and the risks drop steadily afterwards.",1569205952,{},f169dr6,False,t3_d7zpxb,False,True,t1_f167kt7,/r/politics/comments/d7zpxb/young_people_have_a_stake_in_our_future_let_them/f169dr6/,1569207884.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,1569207005.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You’ve been extremely respectful in making your argument.

&gt; Well, let's use Mueller's phrasing: ""the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would  benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and  that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information  stolen and released through Russian efforts."" 

Agreed

&gt; Both sides had an interest in working together and took specific actions, such as the Trump Tower meeting, releasing private emails, organizing rallies on Trump's behalf, and on the other side actions like transfer of campaign data, Trump loosening sanctions on behalf of Russia, changing the official stance of the GOP to opposing Ukrainian protection, and later defending Putin's reintroduction into the G8, in order to facilitate what they perceived as mutual benefit. 

Nope, knowingly “taking specific action” together during the campaign would be a crime, which there was insufficient evidence of. Pretty sure some reports say the administration was “to stupid” to know they were working with Russia tho to be fair. 


&gt; Some of these acts were criminal, and some were not criminal. 

I’m pretty sure there isn’t some big coverup by the media hiding criminal acts discovered in the mueller report. 

&gt;As such, I can definitively say there was collusion. 

I’m pretty sure The mueller report doesn’t back up your claim that any of the interactions were criminal. In fact it says the opposite without the made up crime of “collusion”

If you have one glass manufacturing plant that makes a profit of one million a year then obviously your making more money if you had two. You'll eventually start seeing overhead costs catching up so like say if we had 10 glass manufacturing plants they might be averaging 800k instead of the one million per plant but obviously your making a lot more with ten plants then one.

In my opinion skilled labor does not need to be unionized in most parts of the private sector at this point. Low income jobs could really use unions but that's unlikely to happen. Their too replaceable for it to ever happen.

Secondly, if/when Trump declares the outcome of the election invalid for whatever reason, and it goes to the courts, there will be the greatest power struggle this country has seen in fifty years in a short span of time, kind of like 2000 Florida--the non-incumbent socialist and the female senator will likely not court the support necessary to win that fight against the tools of the far right, which are increasingly dangerous and growing in number, and it could be assumed that Biden *might* be able to gain support of certain elements of the judiciary, military, intelligence etc. that are *designed* to protect the status quo, not necessarily ensure democracy like we want to believe. **Yeah, I think it** ***could*** **potentially get** ***that*** **bad, as in coup bad, at election time; however, I'm not talking tanks rolling around, but something far less visible to the average voter.** Biden would presumably have a better chance in a fight like that, but the machinations of such a move are fairly not well understood in a country that has stably handed over power for two hundred years--the Trump conglomerate, consisting of everyone from disinformation agents like Lewandoski and his old firm to nation states like Israel, is likely counting on it as a possibility. *But let's disregard that chance and look at other problems we face...*

The worst of these powerful people and conglomerates don't care about morals or conduct, and will go with the candidate that serves their interest. All that binds them is greed, into a compact of a fluid hierarchical structure of businessmen, state actors, and criminal elements--see Mueller's 2011 [Iron Triangle](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/speeches/the-evolving-organized-crime-threat) speech to figure how long we have seen this emergent threat coming. Then there are some less aggressive actors, but they will always choose the Shock Doctrine of Trump and kleptocracy over a functional federal government that does not serve them totally--now that that cat is out of the bag with Trump, a kleptocratic and toothless federal government, there might not be any going back. This is an evolution of the Bush/Cheney ""unlimited executive"" 3.0, with the power of a fully fledged propaganda arm and foreign help (SA, Israel, Russia, and possibly China for now). So, even the neocons will begrudgingly get behind Trump--though some of them would support Biden in the name of power projection and national security, but never a socialist leaning president with this climate and the shown power of the executive, which if wielded by a socialist would be a pain in the ass for them--and the neocons are probably some of the weakest Republicans compared to this new strain of hyper aggressive multi-national syndicates. 

The Right--and this term should start losing meaning as the most aggressive of these rising multinational oligarch networks transcend peasant ideology in the name of power--has had a taste of almost unchecked power, all around the world, and there could be no return without taking back the White House and making serious changes. The lower rings of somewhat normal human beings are being indoctrinated so that the necessary power vested in the individual to stand up for institutional norms is eroded in the name of reactionary, anti-left dogma instilled via the propaganda networks--see the Boofer. 

Fox News and Republican Propaganda Networks have been priming the anti-socialism and anti-woman rhetoric forever. It will be easier to instill fear into people than I think a lot of the Left realizes, mobilizing the Right like they did against Hillary (who was a primed target for fear and hatred). Couple this with the power of the executive to sow chaos before the election, the insecurity of our elections, foreign intervention from Israel/Russia/SA/China and the machine power of Big Data Analytics like Cambridge Analytica and you have a Machine built to win.

Furthermore, a divisive candidate will serve the interests of Russia. Tear this country at the seams. And they will continue to shock the system--read Naomi Klein's *Shock Doctrine* to get a sense of the shift from the Rove playbook to something that has now fused with the Putin playbook--to the ultimate benefit of those who want to instill nationalist ideas upon the populace, but themselves live and make money sovereign from any nation or federal government, unless that government is a tool to steal money from the pool. They would happily tank the economy, divide the country politically, terrorize and psychologically manipulate the population with a constant stream of chaos (Fox News ran with this tactic under Obama, but now this playbook is run from the freaking White House every damn day, so be careful to how you react to the news these days because it is a barrage of intentional fear and confusion meant to immobilize and control; and this psy op is what they used to call Winning Hearts and Minds), and go to war if it further entrenches them as rulers of the world.

Yang is saying this problem is not going to go away with things like a FJG. It's not going to go away with a 2 cent Wealth Tax on billionaires (evne though that would be nice also).

But he's pretty well connected to lots of other problems and has a list of solutions. When he spoke to, say, Kara Swisher at Recode Decode, lots of the questions were about tech and the impacts of tech.

Like this gem just as an example:

&gt; SWISHER: One of the proposals has been going around related to tech and I think we can avoid is the breakup of big tech. I’m of the side that more competition is better. Breaking things up does create opportunities for others. And when you don’t have a government involved in helping seed this stuff, it’s up to these big companies to coalesce around two or three giants. And in this case, it used to be just Microsoft, now it’s sort of Amazon, Facebook, Google. How do you look at those proposals to break them up?

&gt; YANG: I think there are instances where we should look at having some of these companies divest parts of themselves, where there’s been excessive consolidation. And it’s also true now that the business plan for many entrepreneurs is just to get acquired. Like it’s not trying to build the next business that’s going to last for decades. It’s like, “If we become a big enough threat then Facebook is going to buy us.” And that’s bad, over time it’s bad for innovation.

&gt; I will say though that the lens that some of the other candidates are taking seem to be 20th century approaches to 21st century problems. Where it’s not like if we created four mini Googles, that would somehow resuscitate the Main Street businesses of Indiana or whether any of us would want to use the fourth-best search engine. No one here is Bing-ing anything and some of these markets naturally consolidate to one winner.

&gt; None of us would ever consciously use the fourth-best navigation app. It’s like, I want to use No. 4 to support them. It’s like, of course not. Like which one’s the best, with the best data and the best traffic? And so we do need to try and solve these problems. To me, the most human problem that [facebook] is posing is that the data clearly shows a huge rise in anxiety and depression among teenage girls in particular.

&gt; That’s coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use. And this is something that’s plaguing families around the country. And so, to me, that’s something we have to counteract as quickly as possible. And breaking up the ownership of the company may not make that any easier. It might even make it harder.

traveled to cities where homelessness is rampant and visible - which is pretty much any major city on the west coast. 

There are also a lot of reasons this is a really hard problem to solve:

1) people aren’t all homeless for the same  reason. It happens because of mental illness, substance abuse and simply falling on hard times, which means there isn’t a single, simple solution to the problem.

2) the problem is getting worse. For years states have defunded mental health treatment. Then there’s opioids and fentanyl. Housing prices are going up faster than incomes. Medical and student debt are making people more vulnerable.

3) this is a national problem that has been left to a few cities to solve. No single city has anywhere nearly the resources needed to solve all these problems.

OK. The combined population of all cities in the US with a population above 1 million is 25.5 million, or about 8.5% of the total US population. And four of those cities are in Texas and one’s in Arizona so it’s not all big city coastal elites.

It's not an open system, they leverage their market share to prevent competition. They also did pretty nasty things with planned obsolescence and ultra sensitive moisture detectors to screw regular folks out of hundreds of dollars in repair fees. And they locked down access to their products physically so that third parties cannot easily repair the hardware, leading to increased official repair fees or sales of new product. If you think they don't have incredible leverage, you are simply unaware. 

Google and Facebook leverage user data to make profit. If you don't think that is not powerful, look to the 2016 election. 

&gt; How do you define ""too much?"" Does Bill Gates have too much? What about Warren Buffet?

Bill Gates got there by literally doing illegal shit to monopolize the industry. He didn't win by making a product people generally wanted, they made sure they were the only reasonable product and then extracting what was essentially a Microsoft tax on literally every PC sold even if you didn't want the damn software. Of all your examples, this one literally lost in several courts as being an illegal monopoly which generated billions for the company. 

I don't know anything bad about Warren Buffet. However, he did make his money by investing in other companies. #1 in their holdings is Apple (see above). #2 is Bank of America, which is a terrible company that literally did everything they could to extract fees from low income customers. They are one of the worst offenders for that. And on top of that, he has the ability as a 10+% stakeholder in many of these companies, to encourage them to do less shitty things. But that's not a goal, the goal is only making money, even if it screws people over. 

&gt;  But what is scary is how people think there is just this unlimited supply of money out there and you can just take for the ultra rich and they will still be ultra rich when they gov't taxes them what they need to provide, medicare for all, free college, free housing, free (whatever the next big thing is)

You have no fucking clue what you are saying.

* Medicare for all is intended to reduce costs overall by routing the funds through a single entity that can analyze and negotiate prices. Amazon (and also Berkshire Hathaway tried ganging up to do exactly this, but were not able to make headway due to the sheer size of the insurance and healthcare industries. You can implement MFA with only the fees paid today by your average person by your average person

* Free college is provided by literally every other first world country besides the US. Even if it's not free, it's heavily subsidized and much lower base cost. There's a reason we have a ton of people coming to work in the US from elsewhere, we literally are not satisfying our need for educated labor. 

* We already provide free housing. Jail. Migrant detention. In those situations you pay more per inmate per year than the median person makes in a year. Instead, why not make it easier for those people to fit into society without resorting to illegal activities? What about the youth? [Why do kids join gangs](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/231116.pdf)?

&gt; Of these reasons, youth most commonly join gangs for the safety they believe the gang provides (Decker and Curry, 2000; Decker and Van Winkle, 1996; Peterson, Taylor, and Esbensen, 2004; Thornberry, Krohn, et al., 2003). Another important influence is family members (especially siblings or cousins) who already are part of the gang (Curry, Decker, and Egley, 2002; Thornberry, Krohn, et al., 2003), especially for Mexican American youth (Valdez, 2007).

It would save money in the long run by using those funds for prevention rather than incarceration. But of course, ""we have no money.""

&gt;...CNN was the first major news organization to give Trump’s campaign prolonged and sustained attention. He was a regular guest in the network’s studios from the earliest days of the Republican primaries, often at Zucker’s suggestion. (For a while, according to the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Trump referred to Zucker as his “personal booker.”) When Trump preferred not to appear in person, he frequently called in. Nor did CNN ever miss an opportunity to broadcast a Trump rally or speech, building the suspense with live footage of an empty lectern and breathless chyrons: “DONALD TRUMP EXPECTED TO SPEAK ANY MINUTE.” Kalev Leetaru, a data scientist, using information obtained from the TV News Archive, calculated that CNN mentioned Trump’s name nearly eight times more frequently than that of the second-place finisher, Ted Cruz, during the primaries.

&gt;It’s hard to imagine that either Trump or Zucker would be where he is today without the other. Trump’s foray into reality TV gave Zucker a prime-time hit when he badly needed one; now, Trump’s foray into politics has given Zucker a big story when he badly needed one.

What about them? Those theories are based on object facts too. That's what a theory is. 

&gt;You don't need to take too deep of a dive into what you call 'objective facts' until you find a layer that is already far removed from anything empirical.

I don't follow. Even a thick bedding of theories are all built on objective facts. Theories aren't built on hunches, suppositions, and subjective guesswork. 

&gt; Any change in the theory will change those numbers and their relationship to the reality observed.

But any changes to a theory aren't going to be arbitrary or emotional subjective tinkering. Any changes to a theory are going to include newly discovered facts, and they aren't going to negate previously discovered facts, the new facts will just further refine our understanding. This reminds me of the common mistake people make, in thinking that new theories replace older theories, as if Newton's laws were all proven wrong when Einstein came around. This is not true. Newton's laws are still accurate; Einsteins laws didn't replace them, they supplemented them, explaining the behavior of matter at extreme scales, and refining our understanding, not undermining &amp; replacing it.

&gt;Who decides where the instrument is pointed at? Humans do.

I don't think this makes nearly as big a difference as you're suggesting. No matter what star we're looking at, the spectroscopic analysis will be an objective analysis of that star's light signature. No matter what chemical we're looking at, we can determine its objective structure. 

&gt;There is a whole lot of human folly involved in doing science, no matter how hard of a field science it is.

The politics of a scientific field are not the same thing as the actual tools and measurements used to generate data. If someone misuses a tool, or fudges their numbers, this isn't indicative of the supposed inherent subjectivity of science, it's just bad science, and the institutional process of peer review is designed to root that stuff out and remove it. 

I think you're making a category error in these posts, by mistaking the predictive power and resolution of our instruments with the politics of publishing. These are separate things.

For example, anyone could have accurately predicted the position of Uranus, so long as they actually did the calculations correctly (which is not the same thing as saying math is ""subjective""). It doesn't matter what institution you belong to, how grumpy your professor is, or how many papers you've published. The math is the math, and if you do it right, and aim the telescope accurately, you'll see Uranus. The politics of universities, the politics of publishing, and the intra-department drama doesn't take away from the objective validity of the math, and the observed reality.",1569559918,{},f1ln222,False,t3_d9lmbv,False,True,t1_f1lly3d,/r/philosophy/comments/d9lmbv/science_has_never_and_will_never_achieve_a_point/f1ln222/,1569559919.0,1,True,[],False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],bobbyfiend,,,[],,,,text,t2_36gej,False,,"OK, this is potentially really cool, and the authors might be studying something never studied scientifically before, but there are some things to be concerned about, from the [stud](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0346-1)y this blog post-type article is based on:

*TL;DR: the study has red flags associated with ""impressive theory but unconvincing data"" situations*

1. It is really effing difficult to find out how many participants were in this study. Their write-up doesn't follow standard research report format, so (to me, used to reading such reports) it feels almost like they're hiding some key elements of their methods. They probably aren't hiding them, but they sure as hell aren't making them easy to figure out. They appear to maybe have 12 participants in their study. TWELVE.
2. They published this in a journal that is apparently OK with leaving out or obfuscating a few of the methodological details, and isn't a core journal for neuroscience research.
3. The specific method used for imaging isn't the most commonly-used method out there. To me, that suggests they tried a few methods, and when that happens the researchers almost always go with the method that gives them the results they expected. There are TWELVE participants. I would love to see results from a few different imaging methods presented together, for comparison.
4. Neuroimaging is itself under a lot of pressure right now to clean up its act RE: data fishing. The possibilities for p-hacking are built into the entire process, from the ground up: every pixel of an image used (even if it's processed and run through some statistics) is the result of an averaging algorithm, and the choice of which algorithm to use is, from what I understand, non-trivial. Then there's the statistical processes used to aggregate across images (averages of averages), also offering various choices. Finally, there are the statistical procedures used to estimate effect sizes or p-values or whatever, which also offer various choices. That, on top of the fact that there are multiple kinds of imaging techniques in the first place, creates an incredibly high likelihood that neuroimaging studies can represent, essentially, illusions created by the researcher's expectations. One way of reducing the chances of such an outcome is to have MORE THAN TWELVE participants (I keep putting that in caps, and yes I know that many neuroimaging studies are done with small N, but statistics says ""fuck your rationalizations; it's still a tiny N and your confidence interval is so big it can't fit into your mom's muumuu"").
4. I'm not super impressed by their ""nobody has ever studied this before"" line. Maybe they're right, but this is a claim about a personality trait. See the entire field of personality psychology. I don't know if most people have any idea just how many different theories and tests of personality have been created and studied (often with pretty reasonable empirical methods, though not brain scans) over the past 100+ years. I will bet 5 of my own actual dollars that someone else studied this. In fact, I'm going to try to find some time to search, later. Again, the authors' choice of journal seems fishy, and it seems unlikely that reviewers for ""communications biology"" or whatever would have any kind of in-depth knowledge of the personality research literature. **Edit: [of course this claim is bullshit](https://search.proquest.com/openview/47a2561455af6d80b4ff61c7ffb5b2bf/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=29096).**

The claim they make for #4 (above):

&gt;One also has the power to choose not to choose, deliberately to allow one’s actions to be determined automatically by surrounding events. Though other reflexive cognitive processes are the focus of intense attention3,4, such “volition-on-volition”—meta-volition, for short—**has not been previously investigated**. 

(My emphasis). Despite the fancy neuro-cognitive language, they're basically just describing something that would seem familiar to most people, possibly ""spontaneity"" or ""going with the flow"" or similar. It took me literally 10 seconds in google scholar (""personality spontaneity measurement"") to find the report linked above. I'm open to being wrong about this, but I really think these authors are full of shit when they claim they are the first people ever to study or even name this construct. They might be defining it slightly differently from past researchers, but that's really not the same thing as truly being able to comment ""first"" on some aspect of human cognition.",1569325103,{},f1b635j,False,t3_d85s9d,False,True,t3_d85s9d,/r/philosophy/comments/d85s9d/neuroscience_proves_nietzsche_right_some_people/f1b635j/,1569325104.0,1,True,[],False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;I appreciate the academic approach and wouldn’t want you to get lost in the artistry, but I do feel a few crisp visual aids might go a long way to convey your idea.

You are not the first, second, or third person to say this to me lol. I am intentionally not having visual aids, but I am going to make a video that discusses different ways of representing the model after I get the last two main videos done (ratiocinators and instantiation).

&gt;About the model itself, are the tesselations of ratiocination of domains presented arguably the complete list, or are they more like examples of categorically shared attributes? Where does electromagnetism fall?

Ratiocinator tessellations (fabric, particle, chemical, amalgam, telluric, celestial, stellar, galactic, cosmic) are the shared scales / building blocks that take on different character depending on what ratiocinator(s) you use to make sense of them. If you look only through apparatus ratiocination, the universe looks like [organicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organicism), if you look only through the matter ratiocinator, the universe looks [materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism). 

About the completeness of the list of tessellations – it is maybe not a complete list, just covers the scales of the universe that our species is currently is aware of.

About electromagnetism, it would be an instantiation domain within material dynamic particle.

&gt;If Life is a qualitative fractal, what does the imaginary quantity of the equation represent?

I suspect that architectonic models in general are attempts to draw a big circle around our total human capacity to know and do things, and are therefore schema ratiocinator instantiations, and the act of converting it into math is a recursive application of applying the form ratiocinator to measure it.

&gt;As far as I know this effort has stalled, though not just for a lack of convenient way to organize the data. Please consider making your software an open source platform to ensure its availability to all as we move forward!

Yes, it has definitely stalled. In terms of models, Ken Wilber has one called Integral theory, but the problem is that it is religious, and you kinda have to adhere to its religious notions if you are going to use it. I very intentionally took a lexiconic approach for this reason. There needs to be a model anyone can use no matter what their beliefs are.

&gt; 
&gt; What does that even mean?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I don't know that.
&gt; 
&gt; So no induction then? That's like a big part of science.
  
People are free to do whatever experiment they think makes sense to them. And they share their findings with other people. And other people judge for themselves if the findings are worth further study.  Everyone can make that decision for themselves based on whatever the hell they want.  
But if you repeat an experiment and get the same results yourself, you might believe the original results were not luck. You still don't know, because there is no way of knowing if the first experiment was luck. And if 100 other people do similar experiments and they all get the same results, then maybe a community of people will start to believe the world works like that.  
  
&gt;But your assumption said ""the universe is observable"" and now you say there may be elements of existence which cannot be observed... so what's up with that?  
  
I would characterize that as poor reading comprehension. I presented the assumptions of science. As a human, I'm capable of thinking under different assumptions and capable of using different frameworks. I was not presenting my personal assumption or ethos. Also, there's no contradiction between assuming ""The Universe is observable"" and there being unobservable elements in existence. You've incorrectly equated the universe (as known by science) and existence.  
  
&gt;How is that a solid objection?   

I was just trying to answer your question.  

&gt;But your assumptions did nothing in favor of supporting that existence ""is"", because a trick of a genie or a dream still exist... so... I don't really know what you meant here. You seem to want to do some sort of cartesianism.  
  
Of course the assumption doesn't provide support the question of existence. It's an assumption. That's what an assumption is. It assumes existence and it assumes it has certain qualities. If you want to talk about existence as a dream or illusion, science isn't the right framework.  
   
&gt;Wow so you seem to be trying a lot of conceptual work there. It's almost as if your initial handful of sentences didn't actually explain everything you wanted to explain.  
  
I'm sorry. Did you need more information before you deigned to not answer my original question?  
  
&gt;But then it's a scientific fact that we saw this photon do this thing X times. But how do you get from these supposed ""facts"" to something like a system? So far you've produced a list of facts. How do you get from a list of facts to, for example, some basic tool of physics like Rectilineal Uniform Movement? rectilinean uniform movement literally doesn't exist in nature. It's not observable.  
  
First of all, Rectilinear Uniform Motion is observable in nature. So your factoid is wrong. But to answer the question I think you're asking. Eventually you come up with a model which has a track record of making predictions or matching observations. People eventually come to believe that this model can be used to describe some aspect of the world. We never know that it is true. We have no guarantee that the model will remain accurate into the future.  
  
&gt;Newtonian physics had inconsistencies from day one and we kept it around for a bunch of time without being able to explain why light curved around heavy objects, and it was thought of as ""objectively"" true until Einstein. They knew about this inconsistency all along. It wasn't ditched.  
  
&gt;This is true of a bunch of theories. You should read ""the structure of scientific revolutions"" by Kuhn since he factually refutes this claim multiple times. Theories are absolutely allowed inconsistencies.  
  
I'm going to have to say that your position is so crazy that I suspect you may need to re-read Kuhn's book. And if you read Kuhn correctly, and he really thinks science theories are allowed inconsistencies, then he's wrong. First of all, Newtonian physics is not a monolithic model. It's a collection of theories and techniques which have evolved over time. And even though we now know they were incorrect in some ways, nothing was observed to be incorrect and kept. Key in this understanding is that observation relies on instrumentation and is only accurate to a certain degree. So Galilean transformations were incorrect, but remained undetected until the advent of electricity, because we lacked the instrumentation needed to detect the error in the transformations. 
When it became clear that Newtonian Mechanics was wrong, we absolutely ditched it in favor of Special Relativity.  
Theories are allowed 0 inconsistencies. They must be consistent with observable data and must be consistent with each other insofar as they make measurable predictions that overlap. Also, the existence of outstanding questions in nature is in no way an inconsistency in any model, unless it is something which the model purports to explain. In which case, it is considered incomplete until it can explain that portion. In the event that data comes out that completely contradicts the theory, the theory is discarded.  
  
&gt; I did answer your question, and I studied philosophy and focused on epistemology for a nice chunk there. I didn't do it professionally so sure I'm an amateur, but I've done my reading.

[],sledgetooth,,,[],,,,text,t2_aacwa,False,,"Completely agree with your statement.

This has a lot of backstory I won't delve into entirely, hopefully I can get my point across without being too wordy.

I see life in a polarity of masculine and feminine energy and respective behaviors. Some expressions are unionized and androgynous. Beyond that, I get a sense outside this trinity into something that breaks 2D/3D. These manifestations within the M/F duality are, to me, manifestations of a greater cosmic paradox. Summing up fem is difficult to attribute words to, because its very much a sensory experience. Its the mystical. You could say abstraction, and what fear also calls chaos. There's something very ""other plane"" about its distilled essence, something astral. 

The feminine is borderless. It's non-objective. This is the problem seeing life only as an objective pursuit. It's only half the spectrum. I can simply be, without being relative to. I can float the river, so to speak. Its only when we aim to carve, to invest our resources for X amount of time and energy spent into a future vision we have that we step away from this purely ""being"" state. Its like playing piano purely because we love the sensation and the feeling of it, the experience of it, versus engaging with the piano as a tool to be better at the piano to utilize for some ""grander"" reasoning. These are the poles, and we fit inside the spectrum to some degree or another. 

Love is borderless. It accepts, understands, embraces, and connects with all human beings. It is resonant with the link between us all. When we are objective, we have to build certain walls and dissociate from certain aspects of our ""total human"" self. We put blinders on, so to speak (no negative connotation meant) as a means to accomplish this goal. Sometimes this goal means infringing on the purely-existing-experience of another culture. Sometimes it means infringing on the goals of others. In these times, we either sacrifice some level of our empathy or some level of our goal as an outcome. 

Its basically the fault of Buddhism. To me, philosophies are only deviates. They are just modes, just ways to be. No one more right nor wrong than another. Sometimes something is deemed as a problem (relative to our perception), we address the problem, and we can do so with a myriad of different philosophies. We get caught up in ""the right way"", but there are only ways. Buddhisms problem is that it is quite a passive experience. 

I reached out in a question of why this whole drama is going down while in my transcendental state. My best guess is that the universe is learning from us, we're essentially uploading data (like The Matrix was meant to express, until they made it about energy as opposed to data), and that it wants us to expand akin to how it expands. It wants us to harvest our planets resources as a means to spread life out from our planet onto other planets, like our planet is sentient in its own sense and it knows we will take from it and thats okay. Its only problematic (like any avenue or philosophy) when that harvesting goes too far. If things aren't attuned, well its obvious there are measures that can happen to reset our planet. If Buddhism were ""the way"", we would never take from the earth by any great measure. It is a way, and its part of the process. 

In my state, I understood perspectivism, which I hadn't read about before, but found wisdom very similar to Neitzsche (with some variations). I also understood the pressures on us in certain ways, how they activate certain parts of the brain and put us in certain modes, and how our Western culture emulates this at large to utilize the collective energy for...well, things seem to be shifting anyhow. 

I existed just to spread ""light"" or joy, so to speak. I was having the sensations of feeling significant connections with people around me and striving to have genuine conversations with them (socialization is a muscles I've yet to work to any great length). I hung out with my ex, it was really positive. I found myself ""borderless"" once I came back from my trip, I didn't have boundaries. In a sense I was just naturally in a sensitive state. I started to catch on to lies, I started to get the idea she was trying to use me to make someone jealous, and it fucked with my head, so then borders start going up. Love isn't openly offered.

Personally, I know now that I don't cling to my identity and objectives so much that I am afraid of keeping myself emotionally open when I am in the mode for it. My objectivities are generally localized and temporary, so I don't need to ultimately avoid certain potential disasters. If they add volume and vibration to life, they enhance the experience of living, so now I just dive and let the chips fall where they may. It allows me to live more now, while also having aspects of objectivity. 

When you give love to someone, you are focusing on them, you are connecting to them, and as you are literally lending your lifes essence to them, you attach to them in some degree. People say don't become attached to things but I think this just hinders connection. I'd say don't be afraid to burn down with the house and allow yourself to spawn anew. 

Objectivity has its utility absolutely. It's just another way. I find my M/F energies balanced, but as a result they aren't profoundly one or the other, so my personal philosophy is to oscillate between energies and philosophies. I'm absolutely fascinated by what I would call very imbalanced people. The people who live purely on the river and retire at 19, just to fluidly swim through life, dancing with it along the way. The people who have total laser focus on singular objectives who lift mountains from the ground. These are big differences in M/F energies. Its surprising to me how fundamentally different the mentalities and perceptions of the world are to both these energies. Its difficult having discussions about F in words, as I said. Poetry does it well. Its life with a lot less of a filter, because there is less objectivity. As a result, the whole thing gets a lot louder, more vibrational, and thats part of the sensitivity. When I was in my state, a loud metallic noise of someone washing a dish completely crashed into me, which was very atypical. Anyway, there's something very psychic in the fem, the non-objective, and being present to the wide lens. If you can remove language from your head and become completely sensory and emotion based, no past no future, absolutely -now-, you'll step into some of that subjective wisdom.",1567912129,{},ezhlj5l,False,t3_d0ji14,False,True,t1_ezgxui3,/r/philosophy/comments/d0ji14/shame_used_to_function_as_a_signal_of_moral/ezhlj5l/,1567912140.0,1,True,[],False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most amazing thing IMO that we are living through is the Bid Data Revolution. This is an awesome development for the intersection of government and business concerning regulation.

It helps bring down tax’s by lowering regulator oversight costs, brings down costs to businesses so they can be profitable and thus expand service area and lower prices. I’m not against regulation, I’m against bad blanket regulation that stifles innovation and makes costs of all kinds too high.

[],sismetic,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1cu5,False,,"&gt; First, four cultures and an ""etc"" does not equate to anything near a majority of all the faiths and beliefs throughout the entire history of the world. 

You need to extrapolate from the data and try to make sense of what I'm saying. I mentioned the oldest and most influential ""cultures"" that spanned several cultures. I did, of course, not include the lost tribe in the Amazon, which would actually most likely do indeed have a form of animist thinking. Throughout history the concept of anima has been manifest.

&gt; Second, even in those four cultures, the beliefs don't line up perfectly on the question of what an anima (or their roughly similar concept) is, which things have one, and how we can know whether or not they have one.

There is not an epistemological way of knowing which has anima but that's rather intuitive, which is my point. People understood the difference between a rock and an animal, and a person.

&gt; Beyond that, it's not like each understanding of anima in every culture in all of history lines up mostly/exactly with modern understandings of consciousness. 

In some ways it was superior. There's the false notion many modern people have that older thinking was inferior. But even then, the concept of consciousness as it is right now in its foundation has largely been the same. Little have changed. From a century to now there have been improvement in statistical information about relating nerves and processing of information but that's on a technological side and not changing the notion of consciousness itself, as that is mainly philosophical. 

&gt; It's laughably reductive to suggest all cultures throughout nearly all of history had the exact same view on what defined life and that this view generally matched up with modern notions of what it means to have a consciousness. Plenty of understandings of ""anima"" do not imply conscious awareness.

The same general notion of life. Not all people within those cultures, but the culture as a generality yes, and you saying it's laughably reductive does not make an argument. I've shown the oldest and most influential schools of thought, including the differing one of mechanism, which even included the appearance of anima.
I'm not saying that the general notion is that anima == conscious awareness, I'm saying that anima == metaphysical essence animating an organism. I, then, I'm trying to figure out what that notion is, and that's MY take, not the general take on it. I'm taking some notions of the general notions of consciousness and being alive, but those are my own formulations.

&gt; Okay, so how do we judge them? How do we decide which of the competing intuition claims is the most attuned/accruate/honest/whatever?

There is not a set system. You require heuristics. It's like saying ""Person A says X and Person B says Y, how do we know who's correct?"" Well, it's not as simple, there are many variables and it can be either simple or more complicated for the heuristic mind of a person. Generally, you have your own intuition that can be attuned and so you can go with that, but you have other tools of truth-confirmation. Do you expect me to formulate a truth-confirmation systematization now?

&gt; First, dividing consciousness in ""manifest"" and ""latent"" still doesn't address the problem of preconscious infants. If an organism which has never previously had manifest consciousness (like babies have not) can still be said to have latent consciousness in light of the possibility that it may someday develop manifest consciousness, how do we determine anything isn't alive?

That is a good question. There are actually two questions, I'll answer first the babies question. Well, from my conception and argument, humans are metaphysical entities within a physical organism and as such the consciousness is inherent to the metaphysical entity and so it's ALWAYS latent, but it only becomes manifest in the physicality when the physical organism matures enough to manifest that. Now, you would surely ask, how do you know that the metaphysical has latent and inherent consciousness? And that's a different route, I'm not sure if you're asking me to do all these extensive philosophical formulations on different fronts. I'm not even sure it would be fruitful, specially if we come from different schools of thought. As the phrase goes, we shouldn't waste our ammunition and we need to choose our battles, and some battles ought not be so, from my analysis. There's a big difference between our worldviews, I think that your worldview is akin to the modern positivist take on a materialist stance while my own conception tries to take from that which is valuable but thinks it's lacking in several ways, even in real life and as such it's self-contradictory, because in your life you deal with scenarios all the tame where you guide yourself by intuition and know more ""spiritual"" understandings. I do not enjoy - or think it correct - the worldview that seeks to take everything too literal and ""scientific"", because it can't see a bigger picture, a deeper and subtler realm of meaning. If that's our true difference, then we are most likely at an impasse. 

Your other question was: How do we know that everything does not have latent consciousness? Well, Teilhard de Chardin argued as such, and for me, he did so incredibly well, specially from a more materialist position. If our consciousness is the emergent property of arranged matter, then the property of consciousness is latent in ALL of matter, as ALL matter is the same, only the organization morphs; yet, the organization principle of matter is not chaotic, it is observably ordered and as such can be predicted not only from the present backwards but from the present onwards, in a higher-level. Details would be lost, but in general principles directionality can be seen in the evolution of matter. This seems to me brilliant and also evidently true that it's almost meaningless.

&gt; You can have an ontological definition of life without that definition being ""consciousness."" Why is it imperative that life be equated with consciousness. What does that get us besides totally avoidable confusion?

It is not imperative at all. The problem is that there is NO definition. But also, that when I understand the concept of being alive it always has to do with consciousness. We all do, I think, because no matter how complex the reactions of robots are we don't actually think them to be alive, even if they were programmed to react in ways that would pass our tests, because we KNOW them to be programmed and so not having a consciousness but merely reacting. Anyway, I do not want to open the AI front, so I'll just say that to me every conception I have of me being alive has to do with consciousness, and given that there are NO contenders to the definition of life, I am perfectly happy to go with my own observation, intuition and reasoning. WHY shouldn't I?

&gt; We're never going to have a singular ""proper definition"" of anything. There are always going to be plethora of competing definitions. That's not a flaw of philosophy or science, that's just how language has always been and always will be.

I disagree. I also don't want to open a semantical front with others already opened, but that ""there is no proper definition"", seems to me, not be anything else but an axiom or dogma. How do you know there is no proper definition for ""things""? If you mean that there's always a disconnect between language and things, I would recommend Walter Benjamin that speaks of that, and I would agree with that, but that doesn't mean that there is no proper definition only that the proper definition is not labelled. Or rather, there is no proper definition but there is a proper UNDERSTANDING of a concept.",1565570335,{},ewn73t4,False,t3_cmmvoz,False,True,t1_ewho13p,/r/philosophy/comments/cmmvoz/the_fierce_debate_about_whether_plants_are/ewn73t4/,1565570337.0,1,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are apparently  7 x 10^(27) atoms in the average body. I wonder how much computing power you'd need to scan, transmit, receive that data and what would go into placing and properly bonding all those atoms so as to maintain perfect continuity. Also if this is possible, makes you wonder why you need the original person to start.

Yes it is, all you need to simulate it is a big bang and many billions of years.

As to the actual question of the continuity of consciousness, I'd say consciousness is not a singular thing, it's a pattern of existence. We perceive it as unified the same way we perceive any object as unified, or sets of objects, or sets of ideas. Its conceptually reducible to its components, yes, but it's still highly influential as a pattern. If there were some less-than-universe sized way of computing all its components and replicating them while destroying the original, then sure, that's still you (your pattern), just abnormally displaced by nothing less than magic.

[],X___0,,,[],,,,text,t2_f7f0u,False,,"Errr...

I've only listened to one college lecture series on evolutionary biology, but it was enough for me to see that we don't fully understand even isolated biological systems. I have taken enough anthropology, sociology and psychology to understand how monumental the task of integrating what knowledge we do have into a comprehensive model of society would be.

Language, my specialty and certainly a key component in any sweeping analysis of societal interactions, is still a field of study mired with dispute. We're waiting on them brain scientists to verify what statistical analysis seems to indicate, as well as what the other theorists have hobbled together through deduction and observations (as well as a lot of inductive reasoning, which is often the best we can do barring human experimentation). 

We might also add to this list of attempts to understand society the subject of ecology—after all, human society is not separate from the natural world it relies on. Just as an example, we co-evolved with animals as a part of our life, and we don't really know what their relative absence means in terms of individual psychology and the combined ramifications of this throughout a society. There are actually scientists trying to work some of this out.

We might also add to this list of attempts to understand society the subject of economics. Economics is by no means a static field of research. Just a little while ago, many prominent economists were basing their economic models on absolutely unrealistic theoretical consumer behavior. The newer models—and I'm no expert, but this is what an expert told me—are based on the partial irrationality of consumers. Given that this irrationality is to some degree an unpredictable phenomena, this means that our understanding is in some part based on accounting for a modicum of unpredictability. In other words, it's based on the assumption that we don't really understand it well enough to predict everything. We use probability. It works to describe behavior well enough to maximize profit enough to be competitive most of the time. That is different than actually understanding it to a T.

I can go on, adding more and more levels of relevant analysis, but the point I wanted to make has been made.

Suppose that you were an expert in all of these fields. You would still need to be a genius like the world has never seen to synthesize this knowledge into a comprehensive model of society.

Add metaphysics and epistemology into this and you're in serious trouble. The very bases of all of the other fields are placed under scrutiny in these two fields, and not always in a senseless navel gazing way. It's not difficult to imagine the universe as a single causal entity which only exhibits difference due to our position as observers within it. What does this mean about the tendency to ""abstract"" conceptual entities from it? It suggests that it's a convenience but ultimately a falsehood. It suggests that, somehow, we could add up all of the knowledge about being from the level of the higgs boson to dark matter to relativity and somehow come up with a simulation of the entire universe in all its particularity. But it also suggest the possibility that there are forces that we haven't yet identified because we are constrained to our role in the system we seek to describe itself. If this were to turn out to be the case, everything would go according to the simulation exactly until it doesn't, and our investments in this monumental synthesis could be absolutely catastrophic.

So, what I'm saying is, sorry—I'm sure it can accomplish a lot, but your engineering degree isn't going to cut it. It might give us some great things, but not the building blocks of what society is built on and how it works.

A supercomputer based A.I. trained on big data is, as far as I know, the best potential innovation we have for tackling as monumental a task as understanding how society works. For that, you would need programmers. Engineers, for sure, but also programmers. And, like I said, the simulation might only work until it doesn't.

You don't understand the possibilities with quantum computers, and you're not thinking big enough for a 100 year timeline (think of where tech was 100 years ago versus today, now exponentially scale that forward 100 years). Right now quantum computers take up rooms, just like the first classical computers did, but they will someday fit in your pocket and be exponentially more powerful. They are not 1 photon state = 1 simulated photon state. Here are a few short primers. With Moore's Law soundly in-tact, in 100 years our computers will be so powerful the limitations you're thinking in (classical/binary) will be entirely obsolete. Physics will jump by leaps and bounds when these new simulators come online (see articles at end, which are just today's tech; they will be dusty old relics in 100 years). Heck, many of today's computational limitations may be obsolete in just a few years, and already are in specific areas of calculation in the most advanced quantum labs on the planet. Bear in mind with this description that there are different types of quantum computers being built, so x-number qubit to x-number qubit comparisons aren't always apples to apples if you start reading articles on the web (e.g. superconducting qubits vs. quantum annealing; the 2048 ""qubit"" quantum annealing D-wave isn't as powerful as a future 2048 superconducting qubit will be, and the numbers below aren't for it, they're for superconducting qubits, which google held the record for at 79 last year):

The most effective way to understand Q-computing is by drawing opposing parallels between classical computers and quantum computers. To simply state, a classical computer employs a binary system consisting of either “1 or 0” to encode data while a quantum computer (Q-computer) uses quantum bits (qubits) being composed of, in a classical interpretation, a blend of “1 &amp; 0”. This blend allows a Q-computer with ’n’ number of qubits to occupy ‘2^n’ number of states/combinations all at once as opposed to just one state/combination with a classical computer.

So, if we were to build a quantum computer system being made up of 300 qubits, then we can hypothetically calculate, in a brief amount of time, as many steps (1x10⁹⁰) as all the atoms (1x10⁸³) in the observable universe and more. The unparalleled power of a quantum computer is expected to change our fundamental understanding of the universe.

Here's a bit on seeing Moore's Law in action in quantum computing. This was written in Feb, 2018; Google quickly beat the highest number and was at 79 last year; there will be more headlines coming this year:

In May of 2016 a physicist and associate writer for Ars Technica, Chris Lee, reported on IBMs then newly announced 5 qubit system. In his article he concluded:

In any case, five qubits is still too few to do anything useful. But, if you think you might have a good reason to use quantum computing in the future, I suggest you register and play around, because IBM has a very aggressive timetable for scaling: it expects to hit between 50 and 100 qubits within the next decade. At 50 qubits, IBM will be able to do useful stuff. That means useful qubit numbers should be coming within five years and toys that do neat tricks a couple of years later.

Then just 12 months later IBM unveiled a 17 qubit system.

If quantum computing technology (in general) followed Moore’s Law – an observation that CPUs for classical computers tend to double in power every 18-24 months – we should expect a 30 or 40 qubit system next year.

Only, IBM created a working 50 qubit system last year too. In fact, the company rolled it out at CES last month and showed it off to the world.

Realistically, a functional 100 qubit system could be announced before you finish reading this sentence. It may not even matter because there’s no guarantee that 100 qubits is the magic number that’ll change everything. It could be 500 or a 1000, none of this has ever been done before.

The author shouldn't confuse his lacking an undergraduate level understanding of physics with a need for physicists to accept his crank perspective. 

TL;DR: Physics is, at present, fundamentally disunified in a number of different ways, which isn't really so much of a problem as the not quite certain promise of an opportunity. Scientific theories are, in a proper sense, defined by their utility - science is a verb, not a noun.  They're not really meant to be wrong or right in some hypothetical objective sense. They are instead focused on being something fundamentally different - useful for figuring out what a natural phenomenon will do next. More unified theories will be more useful.

For a theory to be a useful one, it must be validated by solid data from diverse sources and approaches, explain natural phenomena, and be useful for making verifiable predictions of what those phenomena will do. For example, the theory of evolution by natural selection is all of these things while the various theories of Intelligent Design are only able to explain phenomena based on unrepeatable and subjective reasoning. That does not mean that creationism as a representation of who we are through a description of he meaning of where we come from is stupid, bad, or even unreasonable. However it does mean that as an explanation of natural phenomena Intelligent Design is unverifiable, and more importantly, fundamentally not useful for understanding the natural world.

Similarly, Plato's geocentric model for understanding the heavens in a way that imagines them to be a fixed rotating plane above us was very wrong, but its wrongness is trivial next to its uselessness for explaining why the celestial bodies move the way they do. However, it is broadly still useful to this day for things like pointing telescopes as the reasons why things move are only so relevant to tracking their movements and pointing something at them. Tycho Brahe's geocentric model for understanding the heavens, is an example of how a theory could be pretty right but still useless. Motivated by his own flawed understanding of the Bible, Brahe worked desperately to incorporate his data into a model that would keep the Earth at the center. He used his data and Kepler's mathematics to construct something that was many orders more complex and that ended up being more or less just the same thing as Kepler's model - just spinning around on an Earth centered axis for no empirically discernible reason. [It looked something like this](https://giphy.com/gifs/p5art-xn00DcBP6pedG). It wasn't any more 'wrong' than Kepler's model was in a meaningful sense as it could still be used to predict the motions of the celestial bodies in more or less the same way, at least once the couple of his mathematical errors were fixed. The difference Occam's razor makes between the two systems does something ontologically weird but powerful though, where his basic model would have been both correct and be able to make predictions, but the inherent distortion would have made, for example, the Law of Universal Gravitation impossible to discern from Brahe's confused equivalents to Kepler's laws.

Whether more unified theories 'know' the universe in some hypothetically objective abstract sense is almost immaterial to why it makes sense for physicists to be hunting for them preferentially. We already know that [the map is not the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), and that abstract perfection is something that is only really found in mathematics. More unified theories will allow us to make stronger predictions, across wider scales, in more widely applicable ways.

The vital need for rational (imaginative and critical) thinking about fundamental problems remains undiminished. It is needed so that science, and so that academic enquiry as a whole, can meet elementary requirements of rationality. (Rationality demands that one keeps alive thinking about the fundamental problems one seeks to solve.)

The Eagle just lists issues we face today: inequality, low wages, climate change, tech monopolies and financial institutions riding on moral hazard, gig economy, tax havens, fourth industrial revolution, AI, Big Data and so on. Eagle spends a lot of time listing all the problems we face. Then she offers her cure: we need strong, capable and empowering government that benevolently fosters cooperation and competence to all these problems. 

There are several issues I see with this line of argument. First one is that this presentation did not have much to do with Hayek and Road to Serfdom. Eagle did not talk about command economy and its impact on rule of law and democracy - the key concepts in Hayek's book. 

Second issue I have with this argument is that Eagle did not comment on how she wants to achieve all these ambitious goals. There is even a hillarious part around 6:20 in the video where Eagle  points to Reagan and Thatcher for introducing a legacy that she ""we did not manage to overturn when we were last in government"". Why should this time be different - and we are not even talking about overturning neoliberal policies. Nationalizing airlines and all that is probably not that hard. But I am talking about solving all those gargantuan issues we are facing.

And the last point touches the fist one actually. It does not seem to me that Eagle wants to return to planned economy - although she is not explicit on that. However at the end of the video she says that:

Sure, I'm just pointing out the gaps, not asking you to solve them.

&gt;I think this is our fundamental disagreement here. ""Matter is fundamentally conscious"" seems like an ad hoc assertion.

It isn't - it's the conclusion of the hypotheses. If you don't like it, fine, but you have to attack the premises which lead to the conclusion, rather than the conclusion itself. Ad hoc means, roughly, ""introduced after-the-fact to avoid a problem with the theory"", but it's intrinsic (sorry) to the theory, not an add-on to make the theory less vulnerable to attack.

&gt;Correct. Just like you have to explain how proto-conscious matter that does not have any different behavior from non-proto-conscious matter causes consciousness. Do you have any reason to believe that electrons are proto-conscious but quarks are not, or vice versa? 

You're misrepresenting the theory here. There is *no* ""non-proto-conscious matter"" - the hypothesis is that *all* matter is fundamental, because indeed there is no reason ""to believe that electrons are proto-cosncious but quarks are not"". I have already made this point several times, and quite explicitly.

&gt;I disagree.

Well, you're welcome to your opinions. As someone who doesn't really have a horse in this race, though, panpsychism seems like the more explanatory theory at present.

&gt;Why? I mean, this is exactly the unanswered question that seems to be unanswerable.

You claim it's unanswerable, that doesn't mean it is. I could claim that CTM's questions are unanswerable, that doesn't mean they are. I don't understand why you allow CTM its theoretical gaps but declare panpsychism's ones to be intractable and totally vitiating the theory. Like I said, philosophy is perfectly capable of theorising even in the absence of empirical experimentation, so an inability to perform experiments does not equate to an inability to solve a theoretical problem in philosophy.

&gt;I disagree it accounts for everything we know about consciousness. 

Which is fine, because it's not supposed to - the theory is only supposed to suggest why consciousness exists in humans, not replace neuroscience or anything like that.

&gt;I disagree that it's likely to expand to account for what we know about consciousness. 

Again, empirical experimentation will remain the realm of the sciences, but panpsychism posits a reason why consciousness is there instead of not at all, so it fills in a theoretical gap which science has yet to do.

&gt;It seems ad hoc in that it answers exactly one question about consciousness while blocking off any possibility of answering any other questions.

I don't see how it blocks of any questions and again, it's not ad hoc, it's the conclusion of a well-reasoned set of premises. 

&gt;So, first, the question is understanding, not intentionality. 

Searle uses the two interchangeably. Understanding requires intentionality, ""aboutness"" of representation - if I don't know what a symbol is *about* then I don't know what it *means*, therefore I cannot understand it.

&gt;Second, the chinese room is not mere syntax. It's a person manipulating inconceivable amounts of information according to inconceivably large lists of instructions. Of course the book by itself, uninterpreted by an a process, isn't conscious, any more than a dead person is.

Syntax is symbol manipulation. Input -&gt; Instruction -&gt; Output. That's syntatic processing; the system manipulates symbols according to a set of rules (analogous to a grammar) without an understanding of the semantics involved (their meaning).

&gt;""Interpreting"" means following out the steps of the formal system. One of those words that means different things depending on your field.

Fair enough, I took interpreting to mean ""understanding"". If interpreting just means ""manipulating symbols according to a rulebook"", then it equates to syntax and thus not understanding.

&gt;Except the process has connection to events in the world. Of course it does, or it wouldn't be able to carry on a conversation. 

Sure, but the conscious subject involved does not. If I, as a conscious mind, just receive data and interpret it according to a ruleset, it's irrelevant whether or not the process involved in feeding me the data is connected to the world if I, as a mind, possess no intentionality, no ""aboutness"", no understanding of what the symbols I'm being fed mean.

&gt;I'm not. I'm pointing out that your theory does not preclude the books from being conscious.

Which is irrelevant as to whether or not the book understands Chinese, because even Searle, a complexly conscious being, does not. Adding other matter doesn't suddenly make Searle understand Chinese.

&gt;And you think the theory that minds are computation is somehow a mature speculation?

Of course not, my point is that ""this problem isn't solved"" isn't grounds to say ""this theory doesn't work"". As far as I can tell you're giving plenty of leeway to CTM because you have a preference for it but bar panpsychism from making any progress because you dislike its assertions. This asymmetry doesn't appear to be based on the relative strengths of the theories, in my opinion.

&gt;I didn't say it's not composed of more fundamental pieces. I said the pieces are more likely computational than material. And we have a lot of evidence that's the case.

That wasn't my point - complex consciousness arising from basic conscious ""bits"" is more parsimonious than non-conscious material giving rise to consciousness at all, regardless of whether we're talking CTM or some other physicalist theory.

&gt;Again, I'll disagree with this assertion.

So you think conscious objects and non-conscious objects are fundamentally the same kind of thing? Can you explain why we observe behavioural differences in non-conscious matter compared to conscious matter then?

&gt;As I said, it's a surprisingly good argument, but his argument is ""This CD doesn't know how to draw batman, and my xbox doesn't know how to draw batman, so how can the combination of CD and xbox know how to draw batman?""

Eh... That's not the argument. The argument is that if I have a comprehensive Chinese rulebook and am fed inputs and output relevant symbols according to that rulebook, from the outside the system appears to be speaking perfect Chinese, but on the inside, Searle has no clue what any of the symbols mean. It isn't anything to do with competency (""drawing batman"") but understanding and intentionality/aboutness/meaning (""what is batman?"").

&gt;But Searle's argument is ""that's impossible to prove"" and the CTM folks are ""it's probably not impossible to prove."" Searle's argument is ""I know it's true"" and the other argument is ""we're pretty sure we can prove it if we had a big enough computer because we see nothing in the way of it.""

Sure, but if it's not impossible to prove, then you still need to prove it.

&gt;But one I feel is eminently solvable. Maybe I've read more sci-fi than you. :-)

Two things: I never said the CTM problems are unsolvable. Secondly, maybe I've read more philosophy than you if you think the summing problems are unsolvable in principle!

&gt;I feel this is not a bigger gap than ""things that behave as if lacking consciousness somehow come together to make a thing that is conscious without changing their behavior.""

I have absolutely no idea how we've got back to behaviour again. Are you really saying conscious beings don't behave differently to non-conscious ones (in terms of a distinction between inanimate objects and living entities)?

Our sociocultural make-up is important to examine also, but I think too many people have politicized their values in ways where they try to definitively speak about anything that's a personal experience, like abnormal behavior, where we're not ready to speak definitively yet. 

In some cases, it's absolutely nature that caused the harm, with the nature-side needing to be addressed to heal the patient (a person with fused brain hemispheres, for example, will usually express itself consistently irrespective of their environment). While it's worth addressing that there's region-level variance in disease, that could *also* just be because different regions tend to have relatively similar gene pools.

It's not cool to try to bias the conversation by presenting an unreasonable example, so I'm changing your example. With more mild context, my change can actually serve to demonstrate the problem with your general incredulity. 

It's entirely possible that it's better (and smarter) to try to determine risk of long-term abnormal behavior with external devices. [ADHD, for example, is best identified by MRI](https://www.ajmc.com/newsroom/brain-mris-can-identify-adhd-and-distinguish-among-subtypes), where available. There's a lot of room for human inference in diagnosis, but brain-mapping allows for subtype-specific diagnosis with no risk of human inference (or preferential inference of answers of a questions checklist, for example). 

&gt; dialogue relies on a decidedly holistic understanding of the brain (I.e. a folk psychological model

""A folk psychological model""? 

With due respect, you come off layman, mate (with my not seeing it being negative to be a layman). And with equal respect, a layman shouldn't be dismissing their peers' academic fields as 'folk' without background in that discipline. It's fine if your understanding is incomplete, and it's never a problem to ask questions, but a layman just doesn't have the authority to be speaking dismissively of neurocognitive study.

Freud was wrong. But through his incomplete understanding of things, we learned a lot about theory, and ruled some big ideas out. It's true that we have an incomplete understanding of things at present, and I'll even go so far as to say I'm actively welcoming of any other science's (and in general smart people's) contributing towards a better understanding (and treatment) of cognition, and abnormal behavior.

But if you're a layman, you've got to remember to approach conversations as the layman - and remember that your perspective should reflect a layman background.

At the moment, as a person *more* tied to neuroscience than to psychology, we're not at a point where it's more valuable to defer to the ""stats-and-data"" side of things, yet.

If we throw a ball and it falls, then do it again, and it keeps falling, I don’t think at any point it just clicks and it’s certain knowledge that the ball falls when thrown. It’s just that at first you had knowledge that at one try the ball fell, then next the ball fell at 2 tries, then 3 and so on, so it has an x chance of falling statistically speaking. But due to human nature we know people have tested gravity, but we don’t know the exact amount of times this has been tested and failed/succeeded, and even if we had a number we can’t really imagine accurately exact big numbers as humans so we just say “a really huge chance”

If I had perfect knowledge of how many times something has been tried and how many successes and failures, and the ability to interpret that information, then I’d keep in mind there’s a less than 1% chance (and have an exact number) this would fail

Think of it this way: if you throw the ball the first time, you ask “is it closer to 0% or 100% chance this ball will fall”, then it succeeds, next time it’s 50% and 100%, then 100% and 66%, 75% and so on. Does it matter between 100% and 99.9% for example though?

but this is all really theoretical and doesn’t take into account the fact that knowing how gravity works for example tells you that the ball will always fall unless something else changes it, and these tests are more observations on the environment around the ball and whether they would stop falling or not (a tree that can catch the ball for example). This is just raw data with very little context. So really what you need to do after saying “screw it, my human mind can’t comprehend the difference at this point, it’s ‘true’ in the sense that it works consistently based off my arbitrary standards, and my arms are tired” is to ask *why* it’s like this, how the few exceptions occurred, how this can be applied to learn more knowledge, how the failure chance affects this, etc

Calif friends is the only reason I’m on facebook), the vegans and their children seem to have many more health issues than the non vegans, and even though we are all within about 4 years of each other age wise, the strict vegetarians/vegans look about 10 years older than the rest of our group. The sole exception is the vegetarian who raises chickens and eats eggs on a daily basis. She and her family post health issues far less frequently than the other vegetarians/vegans in our social circle... but about the same level as the omnivores. 

We are all in our late forties now, and although it’s not in anyway attributed to anything other than random coincidence (probably) the only two people from our group that have been diagnosed with cancer (so far) are both vegetarian/vegan.   

The vegetarians/vegans in my social circle are, almost universally anti-vax, believers in holistic/alternative medicine, aroma therapy, healing crystals/magnets, and other new age bullshit. Which might be taking just as much of a toll on their health as their diet... as their image of themselves revolves around (or informs/dictates) their diet... plant based, natural, non processed, cruelty free.  

They also tend to dismiss actual medicine as some sort of evil... tested on animals (re: animals tortured/caged), synthetic, unnatural, big pharma (corrupt, exploitive)... I just noticed a few of the same arguments they have about factory farms and big pharma. Which would make sense if they are making decisions based on maintaining/inflating their self image, rather than on actual scientific data (especially in regards to modern medicine).   

Sorry about the wall of text, kind of a thinking out loud rambling concerning the 8 steadfast vegetarians/vegans in our 70 person social circle that came together as inseparable friends in the late 80s early 90s, although the vegans in our circle didn’t really hit that extreme until the late 90s, and were just vegetarians previously.   


Except for the one vegetarian that raises chickens, the other 7 all seem to have a lower body weight than the omnivores, they do not look healthier though, they visually seemed to have aged 10 years more than the rest of our group (faces much more wrinkled and sunken), they are also constantly posting health issues, and the “holistic” treatments they’re taking for it. A rough guestimate would be that they post about health issues 3x more often than the omnivores of our social circle (with the exception of one female omnivore who, between her and her kids, seems to be a non-stop cycle of health issues... she shares the same holistic medicine view as the vegetarians/vegans of our group though, so again, that might factor in their overall health as much as their diet).   

Granted, these are personal observations from a very close circle of 70 friends whom I’ve had the opportunity to observe over the course of almost 30 years. Which I think carries more weight than a single anecdote that is little more than a snapshot of one person and a single point in time, with no control group. I’ve kept in touch with these friends from the time they were 18-19 to the present, almost 30 years... we were all in peak health at that time, our diets, lifestyles, and places of residence have diverged since, but (with the exception of one) the vegetarians/vegans seem to have far more frequent health issues than the omnivores (save one).

Look at some of the big right wing YouTubers. Black Pigeon Speaks releases about 7 videos a month. I just checked out Sargon of Akkad's channel, he has put out a wopping 17 videos since December 14 (exactly a month ago today), and many of them are well over 20 minutes in length.

These dudes clearly aren't doing research. These aren't rehearsed, scripted videos, they're rants with the aesthetic veneer of rationality, to fool people who don't watch videos critically.

Now look at Leftist YouTube. Most of them release only one video a month. Shaun, ContraPoints and Hbomberguy sometimes even take well over a month to release a new video because they put so much work into each individual one. PhilosophyTube is one of the speedier ones among them, but even he only averages about 2 or 3 videos a month lately.

I honestly wonder what reason Right Wing YouTube fans would give to explain this disparity. Sure, ContraPoints and PhilosophyTube and Hbomberguy tend to put a lot more work into the aesthetic parts of their videos too, using elaborate lighting and costumes. But even Shaun, who usually just narrates over a still image of his profile picture, spends an entire month crafting most of his videos.

“science is fundamentally a cumulative enterprise. Each new discovery plays the role of one more brick in an edifice.”

Philosophy has zero means to challenge an empirical field. The contextually empiricized cannot challenge empirical data. Only its interpretation.

Biology? No.

Chemistry is not physics and they use the same empirical model. So does archaeology.


It is the empirical model that works.

Physics just has the best show to tell.

This is where the bullshit meets the plausible. Logic is intrinsic but logic is not glued to philosophy. The Greeks did. That doesn't mean it has to be that way.

,PhiloSofie,,,[],,,,text,t2_hzgn5,False,,"Reading the transcript, the individualist perspective seems important to (the very aptly named!) Prof. Rapport.  As such, however, the whole thing reads anachronistically.

Rapport seems to suggest that fieldwork involves taking on an identity that combines one's self with that of the subjects of one's study; this is ""me across the boundaries of you"" (my paraphrase).  The social scientist tries to observe within a particular social space by operating within its values - taking up physical activity when expected, talking the talk, and otherwise blending in to gather precise observational data that one will, at a later point, don one's scientist hat to analyse and evaluate.

It's in this context that he interprets Platonic Love as ""Desiring to know the Other"", and sees this kind of engagement as authentic.  He thinks it can avoid relating to others as classifications, since it has to recognise the other as particular rather than generic.

I'm not so sure.  It sounds like what Rapport is doing is trying to view the other as an inventory of observations tied together by parsimonious theories of mind that one models scientifically.  So far, so Analytical.  But what guarantee have we that each of these inventories is individual and distinct?  Rapport himself seems to at times in his discussion of his fieldwork dip into stereotypes about his objects of study (especially since they seem linked by commonalities of class and gender), and this is what we might expect given the impossibility of the neutral stance of the observer.

I worry that this view of love is too solipsistic and self-reinforcing, and in this respect recent years of study in the social sciences have probably left him behind.  Big Tech has been exactly here, and it's not about Love.  The challenge of social scientists is how to navigate and map boundaries in the political and digital spheres - targeted marketing and influencing are designed to classify and categorise on the basic of the behaviour of the individual, but the boundaries Big Tech creates are concrete and not easily picked apart by looking just at the individual with a compassionate eye.

For example, imagine someone who grew up in oppressive, abusive, and largely sheltered circumstances. It's reasonable to imagine that this person has something of a distorted view of humanity, since their only example of human behavior isn't an accurate representation of humanity. If this person breaks out of that environment, they're going to get a lot of new data about the world, which they can use to update their view and thus their moral system. It might not always happen like that, and people might not be able to break completely free of all the norms inherent in whatever social environment they're in, but I don't think that means that genuine change can't occur. 

Edit (addition): The issue that I haven't addressed here is whether the change I'm talking about involves choice. Choice is a really big issue.

Total speculation but to me it always felt like our imperfect memory stems from an attempt at compression - and it makes total sense when you think how people remember - they know a few details for a fact, and build from there. Most of the time. It takes more effort when needed but otherwise is more efficient and the more you recall it the more reliable the ""unzipping"" process becomes. 

I don't really think sentient AI or perfect-memory humans would treat memory as more than just a pool of available information. It's just more data to compare whatever you are dealing with to.

And about the sentience thing in general - I believe that humans aren't as free thinkers as people might suggest and that lots of the variation falls to chance - from general experiences like senses and emotions, to statistical probabilities in how mulecules interact.

Lots of those can be manipulated to achieve a desired outcome. People play with their own minds, being self aware enough to manipulate their inner machinations with outside tools. Is that sentience? It's obviously not a flat ""no"", but can you call a reliance on outside tools to manipulate our own thoughts sentience either? I don't believe there's a suitable analogy to computers in this case. And they're to us what we are to God essentially (my Bible game is weak tho lol). Creations made to think like us but are mere imitations. The more we improve them the smaller the gap between them and us, which is actually the goal of AI research basically.

This is why I believe in that if computers will become equivalent to human brains, that truly means we're not sentient. We're just machines, slaves to our inner processes that depend on what essentially is a big chemistry/physics playground.

&gt;it may be that in academia you can have some good discussions with philosophers who are well-versed in neuroscience and subordinate their philosophising to the evidence, which is the way round it should be, but there are a lot of philosophers out there who will say things like 'the secrets of consciousness can never be revealed or understood by mankind' (citation very much needed - maybe someone who asserts something as ignorant as this can't really be said to be a philosopher???).


I agree that whenever there is relevant science, philosophers have a basic duty to read and understand it and allow it to constrain their work.  And there are a lot of philosophers who just don't really do this adequately - especially in physics, and especially older well-known philosophers.  But the structure of programs that train cognitive-science oriented philosophers has really changed in the past 20 years - they're largely getting complete formal training in reviewing mind-brain literature.  This is possible because they don't have to learn the lab side of things, and most of these programs eliminated the foreign-language requirements that phil PhDs generally require.  So they have the time to really learn science.


However, I will say that the arguments that support the idea that science has major and specific trouble with consciousness need to be taken seriously.  There are two big ideas about consciousness that I find really troubling.  


One is that it seems like we can't be wrong about the fact that we're conscious - because any illusion of consciousness is still an instance of conscious experience.  I can't think of any other natural object whose existence you can't be wrong about (this is famously opposed by Churchland and Dennet).  


The other is that I can't imagine what sort of evidence/data would explain a neural correlate of consciousness.  And this isn't just me, a lot of people can't imagine what sort of information would allow us to be confident saying that pattern of activity X yields experience Y.  If your experience of the color green is my experience of the color red, I just can't think of any evidence that could resolve that.  We can't do it with self-report because my linguistic tendencies about redness would presumably be extremely similar to your linguistic tendencies about greennesss.  If we were to look into our respective brains to look for a difference between my red and your green, we would already have to know the neuroscientific principle that we're trying to discover.


&gt;*I can't see how this isn't a settled question*. My intuitions about what people believe and the reasons they believe these things tells me that those who do not share our intuition about this are still clinging to the idea of humans as some kind of special vessel for a soul, because this makes them feel nice, so they want to instinctively reject the idea that consciousness can be created if you reproduce the physical characteristics what make it up (honestly, just writing that now, I can't possibly see how that can be refuted without resorting to some kind of exceptionalism).


So the super unsatisfying and trivial answer is that this question is part of an active debate - so that's what makes it unsettled.  It could be the case that the truth is really clear and people are just mindfucking themselves into denial.  I would have no problem betting that a perfect machine model of an individual person would be conscious.  The hard part is getting from a ""good bet"" to a level of confidence that allows me to call it a fact and use that fact as currency in debates.  It's true that consciousness would be a very, very weird thing if perfect models of conscious systems didn't yield consciousness - but we have some reasons to think that consciousness is really weird.",1544309991,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ebdybo0,False,t3_a3wsew,,True,t1_ebcea0g,/r/philosophy/comments/a3wsew/nietzsche_on_truth_lies_the_power_and_peril_of/ebdybo0/,1547363908.0,2,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,,,,,,1398609257.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,7.0,54361.0,r/philosophy,public,,
,TheRiddler78,,,[],,,,text,t2_13rvtn,False,,"The main break-point was the emergence of language and symbolic logic. The theories are numerous how that happened. But it is already proven the enormous majority of what we are conscious of depends on our ability to include it into the language.

Reality itself is just a word. I suggest you think about how language really works. First we create an experiential habit through our senses - we create the virtual equivalent of real objects, movements, smells, colours - all the stimuli we can recognise - in a form of virtual reality inside the neural network of our brain. This virtual reality got somehow mapped with visual and vocal patterns during development of our species. Other species exert also similar linguistic properties, and are believed to posses some kind of primitive logic (f.ex. monkeys, dolphins). Reality is just another symbol like this, a hieroglyph, which stands for ""everything"", a very specific ""everything"" which is further described by various symbolic equations of mathematical and non-mathematical languages. It's like ""mathematics"" stands for all the mathematical equations ever written, invented, etc.

Our brain when thinking the word ""reality"" starts to make a correlation between all the various dimensions (data vectors) of virtual duplicate of reality we hold in our head, and we start to make connections between the various dimensions of our experience.

The question why are we perceiving single reality rather then two or three or ten bound together - might be answered by the fact we exist in a single body (hence we ""instinctively"" gain a notion of unity), and we have a single synchronised experience.

But it might be just due to the fact we have the word ""I"" which stands for a ""one person"", hence the language introduces the unity into our consciousness. However there might as well be modes of perception yet to be discovered f.ex. by artificial neural networks, where the representation of reality will not be a mono-pole, but a synchronisation of many ""brains"" at specific ""time structure"" etc. And as to the more naive straight forward dimension of your question - but what reality ""really is""? It is a process which causes the fluctuation of information as approximated by the equations of physics - notice I used word information, not energy. Fundamentally we can only describe our world as deep as our language allows us. Information is the most precise instrument of perception we have.

This might seem counter-intuitive, to call information an instrument of perception, but that is precisely what it is. Just as our eyes allow us to sense the narrow part of electromagnetic movement of the ""process called reality"", our languages, mathematics especially, allow us to sense through decoding, informational (or mathematical, or symbolic) movement of the ""process called reality"". Now you might be interested in analysing how different response time separates us from the basic stimuli (like light and sound) and from the complex stimuli - like understanding how atom works, or how to solve a particular dynamic equation.

The ""time perspective"" is interesting in also another sense - we take more time to solve the equations of, let's say, a flying object like a ball, but it allows us, if taking measurements, make predictions about the future behaviour of this simple dynamic system. There is a connection between being able to create a detailed symbolic representation of a dynamic system, and making predictions about it's future. When we watch a ball with our eyes, without calculating it's position, we make some assumptions about it's future, we have a resonant circuit in our brains and muscles, that allows us to solve the dynamic equations in real time, and let's say, kick the ball in the right moment, at the right spot, and above that approximate the destination it will achieve after we kicked it.

In that sense explaining how our brain simulates reality will certainly shed some light on the nature of this reality itself, because it seems nature equipped us with a hardware which perfectly mimics (at least) the electro-magnetic part of the universe. Neuronal cells themselves were created by organic chemistry in the very electro-magnetic reality, and so to speak - around the fundamental rules that govern it, and govern the chemistry, and govern the construction of cells themselves. This is how our brain is so efficiently recursive in simulating reality to the electro-magnetic level of complexity.

You see-it's all co-related, bound by the laws of physics, there is no direct transition point, universe is a one big ""process"" for lack of better word, with few fundamental dimensions (elementary particles), few hundred composite dimensions (atoms), millions and millions of yet more complex dimensions (chemistry), you get my point. And our perception can be understood as an selective inverter, which maps (projects, casts against, folds) some part of ""universe process"" upon a the highly structured part of this ""universal process"", called neural network. There it gets doubled as its approximated, narrow-band image, but thanks to this doubling can create an consciousness - that is a sense of being separated from itself (we enter Lacanian psychology here, so I will stop). You asked a question which basically takes an entire universe to answer. Please be more modest and specific next time!

The [Default Mode Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#Function) is basically a system in the brain that activates whenever the brain is not otherwise focused on a task (thus ""default""). Its job is generally to ponder the self, the other, the past, and the future, and to make judgements of them.

Which I find curiously reminiscent of mindfulness meditation's emphasis on ""nonjudgemental awareness of the present moment"" and  ""oneness"". Turns out, [meditation is linked to reduced DMN activity under fMRI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4529365/).

It's less that the brain ""links up to a universal force"" as much as the universe already exists as a big cosmic soup. It's that the brain the groups and categorizes specific parts of reality in order to simplify the data enough to be interpreted easily. It's a heuristical modeling technique, evolved to be incorrect but good enough to be useful.

Why assume it was collected fairly?

&gt;If you gather data about a population and some portion of that population (lets say people who wear yellow shirts) commit many more crimes than other groups. 

How do you find out if a group is committing more crime? Arrest records, conviction records? If a group gets arrested more often does that mean they commit more crimes, or that they are policed more?

&gt;It seems to me that you think that AI ""wants"" or ""needs"" more data and that it would go out and get more. This is definitely not the case. Let's go back to the yellow shirts. AI concludes that a certain big area of yellow shirts should have more police patrols because of the high crime rate which would lead to more arrests which would lead IMO to less crime in that area. 

This assumes there was more crime in the area (than other areas) to begin with, rather than just more arrests. And more arrests does not mean less crime, especially if you look at recidivism rates and broken families/communities. And less crime does not mean less arrests, especially if you take prejudiced policing into account.

This is exactly why we need sociologists and ethicists to be included in these discussions. I hope you are not coding an AI if you are so naive about how the human world works.

This is not a claim anyone serious is making, you are presenting a straw man. It's like saying nuclear weapons aren't in and of themselves dangerous, after all, nuclear bombs can sit in siloes for decades without hurting anyone. You can not look at technology in isolation from the human factor.

The proliferation (and thus widespread usage) of Artificial intelligence can be dangerous(human factor). Mistakes in the coding of autonomous AI can also be dangerous (human factor) as it may justify or reinforce bad behavior, or just behave badly by itself, and we do not yet know what even counts as a mistake yet, hence why we need to discuss the issue of malicious AI and the ethics surrounding it.

,Philarete,,,[],,,,text,t2_9pgqv,False,,"Thank you for your reply! Sorry for being so harsh in my original comment.

&gt; [M]y point was not to say that these segmentations are necessarily of negative character. Quite the contrary, they often are rather affirmative. . . . My point was rather to say that these positive and negative connotations are not necessarily diametrically opposite, as they both help to delineate groups that can become economically viable. Being economically exploited can feel good.

I think this is a fair point. I find the use of ""exploit"" to be a bit confusing though. Exploit can be either ""to make use of"" but often has the meaning of taking unfair advantage of. I'd say that being economically exploited in the first sense not only feels good, it arguably *is* good. For example, is the world a better place because a group of people decided to make Black Panther? I'd say yes. People enjoyed watching it! Assuming people are capable of evaluating their own experiences, the value of the movie exceeded the value placed on the money they spent on it. So, both the viewers and the creators ended up with *more* value than what they started with. So, for this article's purposes, I think either ""exploit"" should be made more clearly the former, or there needs to be some argument for the latter. On the other hand, this may be for an audience that simply accepts the premise that all attempts generate profit are wrong, or that advertising is *per se* wrong. I don't know the magazine.

&gt; those majorities [national identities and maleness within the context of patriarchy] are usually relative majorities, in as far as they distinguish themselves from the Other (that is excluded) and create a (more or less) homogenous inner space. I think this is uncontroversial, for example you can have a town where everybody cheers for the local club, so cheering for the local club won't make you stand out. This is not new, what I rather wanted to say that these dynamics are more and more integrated into the economy. Cheering for a local club can become part of a local identity, but what about big football clubs, like Real Madrid, or FC Barcelona?

I'm not sure I follow here. You say that majorities are 1) distinguished from the Other and 2) create a more or less homogeneous inner space. But how is this unique to majorities? All identities distinguish from the Other. This is not unique to a majority. The point about homogeneous inner space I do not follow. Are majorities better are about consistency? If anything I'd be inclined to disagree. Majorities tend to water down and be less homogeneous. (Nationalism is a good example as unification moves tried to overlook regional differences in favor of a more generic ideal, as in German unification and Risorgimento in Italy). Or we could look at the rapid expansion of who counts as ""white"".

You have a fair point about standing out as a minority (going to an away game wearing your team's colors is an easy way to stand out!). However, even when you don't stand out, you may want to increase the level to which you stand out within the majority (e.g. super fans) by emphasizing identity. 

&gt; And you are certainly right to say that identity is not necessarily connected to exploitation, and not every of my purchases is an act of submission. I wouldn't want to claim that. My point is maybe more cautionary, for us to be aware of the moments, where these acts of segmentation become dangerous.

When does segmentation become dangerous and why? Your example of the ""green"" lifestyle is interesting. Why exactly is marketing it the way it is a bad idea? Is the problem that it hampers the spread of positive behaviors by associating that behavior with a particular pre-existing identity?

I do think analysis of particular cases where this type of issues comes up would be good!

&gt;So here comes the question of universalism. I don't think that anyone will call for a homogenous world where we have no differences. I think a big portion of the critiques was for these differences not to make any political or social difference. So that our differences are no longer marks of exclusion. If I cheer for my team and you cheer for yours, I want us to win in a match, but I don't want to destroy you and I don't (shouldn't) think of you less as a human being. But in that sense, there is a certain underlying equality that we need to rely on. It seems to me though, that these underlying common grounds are disappearing.

Political and social difference seems hard to isolate. For example, sports identities can and do lead to exclusion, sometimes even violence! Political and social equality are, I think, hard to be precise about.

The destruction of other groups is a problem, but this is very infrequent. Conversion or separation are much more common goals. 

I also think the idea that common grounds are disappearing is overly negative. In general, people today are more tolerant of others than ever before. [Racist attitudes](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/race-society/white-racial-attitudes-over-time-data-general-social-survey) for example, have been in decline. That said, I do think political polarization is a serious issue, and you are right to address it. It is very dangerous when we get to enemy language, *especially* when it is tied with identity. Even a good cause can be supported in the wrong way, and destruction is a very dangerous goal to have.",1543004085,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eabhg33,False,t3_9zefos,,True,t1_eaavmsd,/r/philosophy/comments/9zefos/a_few_notes_on_identity_politics_from_the/eabhg33/,1545953271.0,3,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,,,,,,1353870734.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,3.0,17514.0,r/philosophy,public,,
,Arc125,,,[],,,,text,t2_44jig,False,,"Yes, and in nature the problem of infinitely divisible space is resolved by the Planck length, traversable at the speed of light: Planck time. Planck spacetime is the voxel resolution of our universe.  One can't talk about anything tinier than the Planck distance existing one way or the other. If we are in a multiverse, perhaps there are others out there, with different Planck scales, speeds of light, or other physics. But our particular 3D voxel universe is projected holographically outward from the surface of any given black hole, and the interior edge of our rendered universe.  

The universe is likely infinite, but we only render a roughly 13.772 billion lightyear radius sphere of it.  Only this volume has had time for its information to travel to us; they are the only parts to which we are causally connected.  So the farther away something is, the earlier in the universe it is - at least, relative to our location here on Earth. There's a delay in that light traveling to us from those objects producing or reflecting or absorbing it. 

So we are seeing our Sun as it was 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago. It could have blown up and we would not know for at least that long. This also means that we are seeing Alpha Centauri as it was 4.367 years ago. And the Andromeda Galaxy as it was 2.537 *million* years ago.

So, 13.772 billion lightyears away, what do we see in our telescopes?  Well unfortunately we can't - there's a giant wall of plasma in the way: the cosmic horizon. There's a whole era where all of the actual space that existed was pretty small and all the energy in the universe was all packed together. Light could never travel in a straight line for long, always hitting other particles in an insanely hot n' frothy soup of plasma that was all of existence.  The shape of that boundary at the cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot see, mapping the differences in density of that sloshing plasma, gives us information we can use to make predictions.  We now have it mapped out to pretty stunning detail by measuring the cosmic microwave background  radiation that emanates from every direction in the sky: https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1303/cmbr_planck_3600.jpg

That is the echo of the big bang. It is the echo of a single moment in quantum fluctuations that occur continuously on the smallest scales;  virtual particles constantly popping into and out of existence.  They always pop in with an opposite: a positive and a negative attracted back onto each other a moment after the come into being, whereupon they wink out of existence.  There is a three dimensional TV screen static to empty space in the quantum realm. The pattern in that image above is a frozen image of one of one frame of some of that static, right at the yottosecond of the big bang. It's the fingerprint of this reality.

How do we know that? Well we know it as we can only ever know anything in science: make a theory that makes predictions, and see if data from reality matches up. If more and more observational data matches, the more likely the theory is correct. If any significant body of data disagrees with the prediction, either there was an error in recording, or the theory needs updating. Or some entirely new approach to better explain and connect heretofore unrelated disciplines.

So the best theory we have right now that matches with observed data, had a period called Inflation. During this period, space expanded faster than light could travel through it. We think this is likely because it explains the flat curvature of space, getting smoothed out by being stretched out so fast. Also,it explains that opposite ends of the sky in the cosmic microwave background have the same temperature. Why would locations billions of lightyears away have the exact same energy? They must have been very close at some point. Inflation offers explanations for several phenomena.

So in the cosmic horizon, where it is denser is where there was more energy, and therefore more stuff.  This is where we can expect to see clusters of galaxy formation, since that's where all of the atoms in the universe were more concentrated. These atoms coalesced into huge clouds of gas; the denser parts of those clouds sometimes had enough atoms smushed together in gravitic knots to ignite fusion and birth a star.  Stars clear out their local neighborhood of gas and dust, compacting them into accretion disks of matter that eventually clump up into planets, which carve out their own local regimes of gravity.  

These solar systems formed huge discs over time as the combined effect of all their gravity on one another lead to patterns and structures on scales orders of magnitude larger - galaxies. Which were themselves sinew in a larger structure of connections via gravity.  Being attracted more to closer neighbors than farther ones means that matter in the universe coalesces into a web of mass; large clusters of galaxies grouping at nodes, bands of galaxies branching between those nodes, and voids of vacuum growing between them.

We have discovered that the vacuum actually has a repulsive force.  Not only does the vacuum have a seething sea of virtual particles occupying the void, it also extra an antigravity force: negative energy. It is the same small amount, present in every given volume of the universe. Gravity far outweighs this negative energy when there is mass nearby, but there are some yawning chasms of nothing between galaxy clusters.  And they are growing.

This antigravity force from negative energy grows the more empty space between stuff there is.  The larger the percentage of the volume of the universe is taken up by void, the faster it will expand. Yes, not only is space expanding, its expansion is accelerating.

There will come a time in the truly very far future, long after the heat death of the universe, when space is expanding so rapidly that light from a meter away could not reach you.  As the rate of expansion of space increases, the causal horizon shrinks. Once it shrinks down to smaller than the distance over which the fundamental forces interact, matter cannot form. Not long after that, space will expand faster than the speed of light, and the entire universe becomes a black hole at all points.

All matter and energy in our universe started in what we call the Big Bang, and it will end in a black hole.  You could send yourself into black hole  now if you liked, and say hi to Murph.  As you fell in, two versions of yourself come into being. Your version, where you sail past the event horizon, experiencing spacetime as normal, but now inescapably traveling towards the singularity ahead - the inevitable future. There is a second version that appears to an outside observer as if you are slowing down, having the light coming off of you increasingly red shifted, and your particles getting smeared out into a 2d image. Your image eventually fades from red to lower wavelength light until darkness. 

To an outside observer, you just got absorbed into the black hole's surface. Whereas from your perspective, no such thing occurred. You have moved from the exterior to the interior of the holographic projection, and in so doing had your quantum information stored  on the surface of the black hole. Any Planck voxel absorbed by a black hole increases the surface area of the black hole by 1 square Planck length, rather than increasing it's volume as you might expect.  Black holes have the densest information capacity possible in this reality.

So this was a lot longer than expected, wow. Thanks for reading! In conclusion, not only does the Planck length solve the Zeno paradox, but also the Ultraviolet Catastrophe, which would be a great band name.

Why should I believe that facts will necessarily save us? Factual truth does not automatically serve human purposes. To make the jump from facts to morals is an error. Humanity had every reason to believe that human procreation was initiated by male-female sexual intercourse without any scientifically valid way to prove what was actually going on. Every time I laugh at a joke, I have no way to prove that it is funny. How do you reproduce via an evaluation of facts, whether or not a comedian will be funny in the future? 

Why should I trust that my child Charlie will be good? I have no way to prove that he will be a good or bad man. But it is certainly immoral to assume and believe he will be a bad man because he as a two year old factually bit his older brother's finger.

But specifically as regards current technologies and current affairs, if one simply aggregates the fact-based decisioneering of society vs the intuitive decisioneering the morally superior way would be to augment the fact-based. Then it would be the moral imperative of those capable to deliver more facts to society for their collective decision-making processes. It could then be argued that anonymous voting is immoral because it withholds the facts that could aid in democratic processes. That is a road to oblivion as it does not respect individual privacy, it abstracts individuals (selectively, because it could never be comprehensive) and reduces them to short series of facts about them. Which facts of life does God most care about in determining man's moral salvation? The author presumes omniscience. Omniscience is not science.  


While I have no evidence to present, I suspect the Victorian gentleman originating this case would be of the sort who comes from a very circumspect society in which all that was considered to be \*vital\* to know about an individual could be abbreviated succinctly. This is my interpretation of the scope of the prescient observations of one Sherlock Holmes. There was, in his time, no great mystery to that which a man with a 50 pound annual salary was capable of achieving. There were no asymmetries in such a society that could produce a Snowden. Hell, the best of their best, under the life and death conditions of war could not discover the pertinent facts about Kim Philby. In short, a short set of facts is all anyone can muster. Will these always be the pertinent facts? Will they always be moral, or does this enable more moralizing? I suspect, to his credit, Clifford, was simply arguing against those superstitions that were made evident during the aegis of the British Empire at the time. The deadly effects of famine in India would provide a dramatic impetus to speak of rationality. But were those all of the facts required to justify Imperial rule, or are some facts more moral than others?

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that there can be a rational way to determine which sort of decisions are best made according to the context of the decision, but I seriously question the premise that most fact-based decisions, and more fact-based decisions are categorically better suited to human purpose. I think we all intuitively understand (yes, intuitively) that people staring at facts about the death penalty, important as they may be, should raise their eyes from their smartphones containing those facts, when they cross the street. With that simple example of how the value of factual knowledge must always be contextualized, it is not reasonable to say that more people should be more involved with gathering facts to be presented to the public.   


Secondly, I would argue that while in general it is useful to accumulate facts, that one should not establish a tyranny of enlightenment. Human beings have and will continue to lead moral lives without categorical knowledge. In fact, it is the discovery of knowledge that is individually inspirational, whereas drilled instruction can be punishing. The temptation to accumulate power under the guise of factual instruction creates regimented living that is destructive of human capacity. One may appreciate music without knowing any facts but their experience of it. So much of what is useful to humanity is not determined by its factual content. lf this were not the case, people would likely be unanimous in opposition to machines handling facts rather than humans. Facts have values that are determined by human purpose which is not exclusively moral.

,Tyanuh,,,[],,,,text,t2_bqbog,False,,"""Combatablelists do not deny determinism, so the thought experiment is a little flawed. The ocean does not make choices, and so it really only describes the deterministic aspect of reality.""

-- My point was that a brain is basically the ocean. Many, many variable play a role in where the raft ends up. But if you know them all (of the brain and ocean), than the workings of the brain that makes the ""choice"" is nothing but the relevant currents that ""choose"" where the raft ends up. From a clueless observer's perspective it would be perfectly reasonable to say that the ocean ""chooses"" where the raft ends up in much the same was as a brain that chooses left or right.

 ""Then, if one of the times you go back you walk up to him and tell him about something amazing down the left path, he may, and likely would choose left instead of right. And if you always said that exact thing, he would always do the exact same thing in response.

And so he is making a choice. It is a choice that is predetermined by circumstances and information, but that in no way makes it less of a choice. To say that he is not making a choice is also to say that the time traveler is mind controlling him.""

-- So one big concept that is not stated here but I feel is really important to this story implicitly is the concept of responsibility. And it seems to me that compatibalists are very reluctant to part with it even though the data shows it just doesn't exist in the way we would maybe like to.

What I also think you're implying here if I am going to steelman your argument is that if we performed your experiment with *different* people, than the time traveler would manage to persuade *some* people in choosing the other path but would fail to persuade others. And that *that* difference is where we can hold people responsible for their actions and thoughts. And that that is where your free will comes in. Since other people would have been able to choose differently in that same situation, we can hold you responsible for not choosing differently and call that free will.

First of all I think that is completely unfair. Because two people are different in the same sense that two oceans are different. If I drop 2 rafts in 2 different oceans (or lets say the same ocean but in different years so the currents are different) then it would be extremely insincere of me to hold it against the ocean for not delivering me to the bahamas but instead to the beaches of Angola because the ocean *could have had* a different current flow. it just shows we are not looking close enough at the neuronal flora of those 2 individuals that made them go along with the time traveler or not. There was never a question of them going along or not given that we had all the data on their neuronal structure.

Another flaw in the thought experiment is the time traveler himself since *he too* is not free to travel time and persuade people in taking another path. Not realizing that makes it seem like somewhere there is dimension of freedom that can insert itself into situations to change them. But there never is. So ""To say that he is not making a choice is also to say that the time traveler is mind controlling him."" would only be halve right in the sense that yes, the time traveler is mind controlling him, but the time traveler is in no way free to do that so calling it mind control and stop at the time traveler stops being logical.

""If his reasons have not changed for making that choice, but his result was completely random, then how is he making a choice?""

-- He still isn't, and I agree with you that calling that making a choice makes no sense. No amount of randomness gives you free will. Which leads again to the conclusion it simply doesn't exist.

""If s computer prints ""true"" when fed a 1, and false when it is fed a ""0,"" and you only feed it ones, does that mean it is impossible for it to print ""false?"" Or is it just something that did not happen.""

--It simply wouldn't be sincere to hold the computer responsible for printing ""true"" after you've fed it a 1 and saying that it made the choice to do so.

As a final remark I don't know if we will ever get to a situation in society where we, for example, not punish anymore in light of actually punishing people because they were responsible, but simply removing them from society because they form a danger to it in this current time out of compassion because we realize they really didn't have a choice. Firstly there is something to be said for the fact that in the end humans seem to be creatures that sometimes desire retribution towards ""wrongdoers"" and that we should honor that. But secondly if we choose to not go to this idealistic (but in my view more truthful) form of viewing the world and society, we should be at least as honest to say that ""alright, we know that what we are doing is not 100% rational, but it is working well enough that we are going to continue on this path"". Let us at least look truth in the eye and not bend the concept of gravity because we do not like falling down.

We can still choose to hold people ""responsible"" for their actions. But then at least let's be honest and realize that we do this in a sort of heuristic way that makes this society work and not because we have changed the definition of what free will is so that it all fits nicely and we can still use the term. I myself am of the opinion that in fact this society does not work well enough as it is, and that actually being honest about free will and responsibility would potentially transform it for the better.

In any case I've enjoyed this back and forth so thank you for that.

Usually it is through cross-disciplinary efforts, for the simple reasons that social scientists often lack the technological know-how. So this is changing.

Of course philosophy can and does illustrate new ideas, through a intuitive understanding and methods of philosophical query by intellectuals. It is indeed a pity philosophy does not attract as much attention as other subjects in certain fields. However, the practice of treating someone's ideas as the source of truth, such as Foucault did and his readers continue to do, is just ideology, a deeply flawed practice akin to religion.

Your evaluation of Chomsky is pretty much in agreement with mine, and I would add that he has often defended mass-murderers without ever reconsidering his statements. His contributions to linguistics cannot be overstated but that does not justify his political agenda going off boundaries.

Nietzsche does indeed fall into the class of ideology, however he has a special place, because he talks against religion and he is the quintessential critic of ideology in this sense. Also, he lived 146 years ago, so it is reasonable to be lenient on him as opposed to Foucault, who lived 63 years ago, a century later into the age of modern science.

For instance, disgust is a good example of a seemingly primitive emotion.

Fear is more complicated: it seems to involve a change in our perception of things, in our decision making, geared towards reaction speed. Seems, all things together, a good thing to have, for any system likely to encounter dangerous situations requiring quick reactions compared to what training data could have prepared them for. It's probably something that ought to be kept for most (artificial) cognitive agents.

Now consider regret: it seems to consist roughly in re-imagining a past situation in order to learn as much from it as possible, also imagining alternative scenarios that would have led to better outcomes. This seems like a very ""cognitive"" emotion, allowing one to maximize learning from a single past situation. Another emotion that probably ought to be implemented in our AI.

And then there's what we might call ""normative feelings"" such as pleasure and pain, which are sometimes called emotions, but which are so basic to our functioning that without them it's not clear that an agent could function qua agent at all -- without some source of normative judgement, what basis would you have for doing anything?

Overall, you can't really talk about emotions without first being precise about what you mean by emotion, and which emotions you're talking about.

This being said,

I agree with theBearLyfe here, but from a Bayesian perspective. It is highly likely that if I go outside and test Newton's models that they will work as expected. However, there really is no guarantee, and there are a number of physical reasons why this could be so. We don't know if universal laws are indeed universal. They could be localized. They could change through time. We in fact know that Newton's models break down when velocities of objects approach the speed of light. 

Any scientist who took these laws as Objective, Unchanging Universal Truths of Nature would not have been capable of looking for where they break down. Isn't it ironic that the people who press the issue of objective truths are missing the skepticism required to push science forward?

You can successfully perform science while maintaining a fully skeptical attitude that what you're discovering are universal and objective truths. What is important is that you or anyone else actual experience the discoveries. ""Nullius in verba"", ""take nobody's word for it"", and just do-it-yourself. The entire point is to be able to say ""what, you don't believe me? well, fine, test it out for yourself!"".

Science has limited applications. It is a mostly effective approach to knowledge when the questions are simple and the experiments falsifiable and repeatable. But since Fischer and the null hypothesis significance test we've largely abandoned direct evidence and falsifiability in the Popperian sense and replaced it with sampling populations and performing statistical analysis, literally building up a toy model with which to study. This has allowed sciencey sounding stuff with numbers and equations to prop up liberal arts like economics, psychology and sociology. I feel that this is the kind of science that endsciencedenialism would wish that we would stop denying. I mean, why would it matter if someone denied Newton's laws? But are there political reasons for why someone might want a certain psychological study or a certain sociological study to be considered an objective and universal truth? 

Go browse a psychology journal and you'll realize just how disingenuous their studies tend to be. Here's an abstract from a paper published in 2010:

&gt; Political conservatism has been characterized by resistance to change and acceptance of inequality, with liberalism characterized by the polar opposite of these values. Political attitudes are heritable and may be influenced by basic personality traits. In previous research, conservatism (vs. liberalism) has been associated positively with Conscientiousness and negatively with Openness-Intellect, consistent with the association of conservatism with resistance to change. Less clear, however, are the personality traits relating to egalitarianism. In two studies, using a personality model that divides each of the Big Five into two aspects, the present research found that one aspect of Agreeableness (Compassion) was associated with liberalism and egalitarianism, whereas the other (Politeness) was associated with conservatism and traditionalism. In addition, conservatism and moral traditionalism were positively associated with the Orderliness aspect of Conscientiousness and negatively with Openness-Intellect. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of personality’s relation to political attitudes and values.

Now, let's take a look at the methodology:

&gt; Participants and design. Participants included 481 members of the Eugene–Springfield Community Sample (ESCS; 200 male, 281 female), ranging in age from 20 to 85 years (M = 52.5, SD = 12.6). The ESCS is a longitudinal data collection project in which a number of questionnaires were completed by community members from Eugene and Springfield, Oregon (Goldberg, 2005). Participants were recruited by mail from lists of homeowners who agreed to complete questionnaires, delivered by mail, for pay, over a period of many years, beginning in 1994. The sample spanned all levels of educational attainment, with an average of 2 years of post- secondary schooling. Most participants identified them- selves as White (97%). The remainder were Hispanic, Asian American, or Native American or did not report their ethnicity. Because the included measures were spread across a number of years, any results obtained should reflect the more stable trait aspects of the constructs under investigation.

Whoa, whoa, wait a second now... the abstract doesn't mention that this study is only based on a mere 481 people in northern Oregon. There's nothing outside of ""that's how contemporary psychology works these days"" to support the notion that this limited population can somehow be used to make claims about all of humanity. And the big five personality traits? Why not six? Why not forty? Do you get a sense that there's a certain amount of circular logic at play here? BTW, where is the data? I see a lot of charts and figures but I can't even find a way to make sure that there aren't any calculation errors.

Most importantly, why should I believe this study? Can I reproduce it myself? Would I really expect to get the exact same results if I performed the study on a completely different population?

Is this the kind of ""science"" that I should be persuaded to stop denying?

Seriously, this is the meat of the issue. What's the point of science if not a solution to an epistemic issue? Why should we flat out believe the doctrines of the Catholic church? Why should we flat out believe the doctrines of the school of economics? Can I verify their claims for myself?

After that I spent the last 20 years testing the results against the last facts discovered by Sciences. As example, the building blocks of galaxies - our ancestors - are identical to the building blocks of DNA, which is running embryogenesis.  So, I would need several books for explaining it. You can ask specific questions about embryogenesis phenomena and how it is related to Universal History, I can answer that. But naturalist philosophers never gets into metaphysics, we arrive ato the last frontier which is the Big Bang and stops there.  

But I remember two things that could be of interest to who like supernatural phenomena:

1) Each human embryo gets consciousness after certain formation of the brain at 6 or 8 months old. But, it is not that each embryo needs to invent consciousness, the information for it was there since fecundation, inherited from a species outside its little womb/universe. In Universal History we are seeing that here in this region and with biological systems consciousness is beginning at universe's 13,8 billion years old. What is the problem? The universe scale of time is not the human scale of time. What matter here is that this is suggesting that the unknown ex-universe thing being reproduced here - although it seems natural, not magical - is conscious also. Which leads us to touching metaphysics. 

2) We, human beings are almost blind and our sensors are so poor. The natural universal wave of light has seven kind of radiations and we see things revealed by a unique one, the so called visible light. Our sensores does not grasps things vibrating at the other six dimensions.

On the contrary, it is by virtue of the broadened decision making base that those major problems would be suppressed. It is through debate that ethical principles outshine corruption as we have seen numerous times with the passage of things such as Medicare / Medicaid, Civil Rights, Disabilities Act, Clean Air Act, etc. It is in a democratic society that we see the passage of laws that while they may be harmful to the majority in power, they are beneficial to the society as a whole. It is by opening up decision making for debate among the people that more ethical decisions usually get made. Workers within a company do care whether the work that they are doing is ethical, otherwise whistleblowers would not exist. Imagine if instead of those whistleblowers having to wait and see the negative results of a company's decision, those people would be able to bring it up in a forum for debate and possibly sway people to change the company's direction.

If the panel is so concerned with bias in the field of data science, shouldn't a data scientist be involved to avoid implicit bias in this discussion?  The picture they've painted alleges that data scientists play loose and fast with the rules of scientific research, cannot identify or correct implicit bias, have no regard for ethics, and believe that their answers are the only ones that matter.  In fact, based on my personal experience as a machine learning engineer (the proper term to be used for One who puts data science to practical use), none of this is true.

ML engineers carefully consider, evaluate, and mitigate bias in the data they use to create machine learning products.  In the case that James mentioned during his pitch, the AI that evaluates risk for arraignment (NOT sentencing!!!) is intended to *reduce* bias in our legal system by **not** accounting for race, gender, employment, home address, or arrest history (not to be confused with prior *convictions*).  [Linked here](https://www.arnoldfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/PSA-Risk-Factors-and-Formula.pdf) is the whitepaper from the organization that created the model.  See for yourself, the only thing that the model considers is the current charge, prior convictions, prior failures to appear, and the defendant's age.  I would welcome anyone here to carefully explain how this model (which isn't even an AI, by the way, but rather a point-based risk model) would produce a bias based on some protected class.  This alone should be enough to disqualify these people from speaking on this subject, given that this information is publicly available and easily located.

Much of what is being said here just isn't true.

That being said, such regulation would be nigh impossible to draft without crippling the ethical data scientist's ability to produce models designed to help the underprivileged.

AI and big data will be what it will be.  There is no stopping it.  Better to accept it now and think of creative ways to prevent it from being misused.

EDIT: That having been said, statistics and actuarial science have been applied to business for decades, now.  The only difference here is that AI/ML are sexy terms that have caught the attention of the public because of the media hype surrounding it.  Well-deserved as that attention may be, the underlying concepts and methods remain relatively the same as conventional actuarial science, just with more code involved.  I assure you that every racist AI/ML that has been developed has hundreds of similar, secret, proprietary counterparts that were developed without the aid of machine learning.

There are also a lot of gray areas that may call for the use of sensitive data points such as race, the ethics of which depend entirely on the way in which we humans respond to the AI's predictions.  For example, I developed a machine learning model for my hospital that, based on roughly 25 different data points, predicts the patient's likelihood of not showing up to their appointment.  The existing standard model (not developed by me) included race as a deciding factor.  Our response to this information is really what dictates the ethics of using race as a predictor, here, because the hospital could choose to do several things in response to a high risk patient.  We could work with that patient to determine if there are any barriers to them being unable to keep their appointment in advance (such as transportation issues) and help them overcome them by referring them to various community services, or we could double book that patient.  In the former example, I wouldn't consider this racist, but in the latter example, I would have a serious ethical concern.  My organization's response to the output was going to be the latter option. *It was for this reason that I removed race from my predictive model before handing it over to the business*.

You're claiming they are and are disproved thoroughly by modern science,  but you haven't proved that to me -- you've only claimed it.  I don't want to hear that he didn't have as detailed of an understanding, I want proof that he was fundamentally a quack and the big picture of his ideas is so wrong as to be insulting.  Go ahead, impress me.  As it stands I'm very impressed by his abductive reasoning (which I've heard Peterson describe along the lines of ""reaching out beyond what is known to grasp at ineffable truths"") and I think many of his ideas are self evidently true as a matter of ""cogito, ergo sum"" and he's merely putting those self evident truths to words, and that they are beyond measure by any techniques humans possess or possibly can possess.  That is also one of my fundamental critiques of empiricism -- despite offering unique insight it relies on techniques that cannot give us a wide enough view of the world in order to function.  It's extremely powerful for certain functions and so weak in others as to not be functional.  

You're offering a defense of Harris that sounds like you haven't looked into his position.   You keep stating Dennetts very obviously superior position, which is actually a big disagreement he has with Harris.  Harris' claim is that we don't make decisions at all, and that because everything is preordained they are not decisions and are merely the result of natural processes that he wrongly believes (based on studies that prove very different things) are already near our grasp to predict.   He claims to be an empiricist but he uses science within a rationalist model (in the sense that he assumes science is the axiomatic truth-finder and represents an advancement over other subjects like philosophy)  and has basically no respect for (or understanding of) pragmatism whatsoever.  He's of the camp that will tell you there is only one truth and all other truths are invalid.  That puts him in a place philosophically that's pretty unsophisticated.  Essentially he starts with principles, concepts, and ideals before piecemeal evidence which is why I classify him as a quasi-religious scientific zealot.   It's ironic that he spent so much of his career offering adolescent critiques of religion, which are pretty obviously projections of how *he* actually thinks.

You are advocating for strict empiricism.  You said that evidence always trumps hypothesis.  You're even framing any knowledge or assumption about the world as a hypothesis, and saying it's either or.  It's just more rationalist frameworks full of jargon, like Harris would use.   There is far more practical utility in most parts of life by not relying on anything resembling the scientific method.  Human beings don't live their lives like scientists as a matter of our biology.  Science goes against our nature in many ways and is only used for certain purposes because that is where it's practical, and in other aspects of life it's impractical and not used very often for very good reasons.

I suggesting reading into pragmatism, preferably starting with William James.   It corrects most of the major flaws in philosophical thinking because it links truth to results, which prevents rationalist thinking from obscuring reality with ideals and prevents empiricism from obscuring reality with limited data found without clear intention.   For an example of that, how you were able to quickly find one piece of evidence that a Jungian psychologist exists and uses analytical psychology in their practice and thus concluded you're justified in considering it a widespread problem when it's common sense that it's not if you think with broader strokes.   Its the same way people prove all sorts of things.   That global warming doesn't exist because there are climate scientists who say it's bad science.   That the biblical Jesus 100% existed because there are historians who swear he must have.  That the rate of ice cream consumption correlates with the instance of heat stroke, and it must be causing it.

,hereweah,,,[],,,,text,t2_13k0ix,,,"I don’t know. I know that there are certain technologies getting closer to what we need, but nothing of great efficiency (in either ability to suck GHG from the atmosphere or economic costs). There is a lot of research being done on it, because people know we need this stuff. I’m thinking within the next decade, we will see some really big advancements in this tech. 

As for the rest of it, it’s just a matter of action. We need a carbon tax. Renewable energy is already cost competitive, with a carbon tax it will greatly increase adoption. 

One thing that a lot of people don’t understand is that there are a lot of issues with renewable energy. We need better battery storage, sure. But it’s not just that. People who run the grid have to make sure everyone has electricity at all times. In the winter, the sun goes down before peak power. As of right now, that means PC during peak power is useless. And the big issue is they are estimating real time demand for electricity, yet don’t have real time information regarding renewable production. This causes issues in the planning of alternate fuels, and a loss in efficiency. Bottom line, we need reliable non intermittent electricity, and it needs to be nuclear power. 

But, enough of that talk. The bottom line is this all equates to one thing: we need better tech. Awareness and action by the individual is necessary. We need programs or policies to enforce that. Clean energy and production is necessary. We need policies that enforce that. However at the end of the day, we need new tech. Whether that’s shit that can suck carbon out of the atmosphere, or batteries that can efficiently store electricity, or smart grid systems that give us real time data, or tools that can convert plastics to bio degradable materials. Honestly, we need it all. Luckily, scientists are working on ALL of this stuff. 

And that’s why, I’m not a doomsdayer. Cause like I already said, humans are really good at figuring things out when we have to. And we’re trying. And we’re making pretty big strides. 

There will always be political hurdles and corporate bull shit. But, we need the tech, and we’re getting close to having the tech. And eventually, we will be able to greatly mitigate our issues using technology.

Religion tells you that homosexuality is an abomination. If you are an homosexual and believe that, you are never going to live a full life. You'll either practice homosexuality and have the constant remorse that you are doing something bad, or you'll try to adapt to what the Bible says it's good and never be able to live the life that actually makes you happy.

Religion there has hold you back.

There is no doubt people use religion to push their political agenda or their personal interests. But, if you make an objective analysis of the Bible and apply it to your daily life, you'll have to do a lot of things that you don't want, a lot of things that are even illegal. You'll have to go back to things we, as a society, have left behind.

I'm not sure how many people actually read the Bible, but a big portion of it is composed of strict rules and guidelines on how to do most things, stories from the past, and boring data that may or may not be true. Parables and lessons on how to live a happy life are just a small portion of what's written there. There's, for example, a really long text about everything that will make you impure/unholy and explaining the procedures to purge that impurity or mitigate whatever effects it may have.",1533845888,,e3wpn3o,False,t3_95w0mz,,False,t1_e3wfy1q,/r/philosophy/comments/95w0mz/south_parks_imaginationland_and_the_forgotten/e3wpn3o/,1537300929.0,13,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,,1533846313.0,,,,1393271696.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,4.0,7968.0,r/philosophy,public,,
,philosopherslave,,,[],,,,text,t2_1u6qynl4,,,"&gt;What should be a personal experience is applied to a universal level, but such deductions of meaning are purely personal.

Based on my suggestion, you could measure ""meaning"" with respect to any combination of data and interests, *if they are both given*. So, for instance, you could measure how meaningful something is to somebody, based on what that person knows and what that person cares about/is interested in. Likewise, you could do this for an entire society, given what the society knows and cares about. (In both cases, there are of course immense difficulties, both technical and theoretical/conceptual, in identifying what the person or society knows or cares about.)

So my suggestion avoids your objection by taking for granted that meaning is a relation (mutual information) between data and interests, where both data and interests need to be specified, and can be specified for instance with respect to specific individuals. Such that what is meaningful for a person A is not necessarily meaningful for a person B, and stuff that is meaningful for a society C is not necessarily meaningful for D.

As for meaning in a universal sense... can we say that the universe ""cares about"" stuff? I suppose we can, if we assume moral realism; and if we likewise assume that events have a ""perfect"" description from the ""view from nowhere"", then we can define a measure of ""universal meaning"". Those are two pretty big assumptions, though.

Anyway, the point I was trying to make, I suppose, is that just because meaning is really hard to quantify, does not mean it is not *quantifiable*. Above I've suggested a method for measuring meaning which I believe makes good sense.",1533324980,,e3jz58a,False,t3_926hkx,,True,t1_e35pjce,/r/philosophy/comments/926hkx/the_flawed_metric_of_measuring_meaning/e3jz58a/,1537047466.0,1,True,,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,,1533325527.0,,,,1532362760.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,,,r/philosophy,public,,
,soakedinmud,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgvvic,,,"&gt; Really, I can't think of a single political issue that couldn't be solved with a proper model and empiricism.

You think we can talk critically about political policy simply with reference to empiricism? Surely referring to empirical data does nothing to resolve a disagreement between, say, a proponent of limited government and a proponent of socialist policies? And there's nothing that science tells us that would mandate a utilitarian approach. It seems to me that what you said about building a wall is an example of how to use data to pose questions and form arguments - perhaps I was taught some pared back form of science, but science in school was focused on teaching facts about the natural world and performing experiments, not how to form arguments or, for example, recognise when data is being presented in a misleading or disingenuous way (I'm thinking of Brexit).

&gt; The problem with ethics is that it doesn't tell you anything.

This is too big a disagreement to get into; you're right that your opinion of it can't be too low if you're a utilitarian, and that you would want to argue your case against a virtue ethicist or deontologist and therefore be engaged in ethics.  I am not recommending that students get involved in nitpicky arguments about meta-ethics - I simply find it important to encourage students to think clearly and precisely about issues that will arise in both political and personal terms. 

&gt; you can't teach critical thinking to a dumb person

I don't know how you're defining ""dumb"", but I presume you would apply it to a significant subsection of a given population and not just a tiny minority who have specific educational needs. In the former case, I have to doubt that a capacity for critical thought is fatally compromised by being less intelligent - if by critical thinking we mean things like being able to recognise bias and propaganda, not take ""facts"" at face value, and having the ability to say ""I wonder what the counter-argument is here?"". Why is learning these things any more difficult than learning much of the complex stuff in primary/secondary level mathematics and science?

I think at the heart of some of these issues we are vilifying people who are themselves also the victim of someone else's anxiety or manipulation. A sadly common scenario for young people.

Full up, if you unambiguously initiate or agree to sex then decide ""ehh, maybe I shouldn't have done this"" in the middle and 1. Say nothing. 2. Make no change in body language, or 3. 'Fake it'  ... How could the other person ever know? Sure, there is now emotional damage to the receiver. Sure, that's bad. But is the 'giver' really guilty of any wrong? In my opinion, absolutely not. Men and women are often guilty of 'playing the part' in sex instead of being honest that they're not really feeling it. Often they do so as a gift to their partner and intentionally deceive them into sex they don't want. Laws of affirmative consent are extremely difficult to reconcile against the complexities of human social and sexual behaviour.

It's not that physics is not important. But if your view was right - or shared by decision makers - then sociology departments would not exist. But that's not the case. So there needs to be decisions to be made how much research money to allocate to sociologists, philosophers, and physicists. Yeah, that is not related to the ""objecticity"" of physics, but it's related to what we *learn* about. 

&gt; The point of physics,biology,chemistry,maths is to give us an objective view of the world basen on evidence. scientific research is contacted in a way so the results are not affected by the beliefs of the scientists that run the research. Also, every scientific paper is peer reviewed many times by independent scientific groups

You don't need to tell me that, but science may have that goal and still have subjective points in it. (Not sure what that^s even supposed to mean). I really recommend you read this article, it's a classic and outlines the potential problems in biology very well 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/4320377?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

For chemistry, I recommend this: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cmdc.201500091 which is a great study into how industry chemists decide which molecules to look into in order to figure out whether they may help in future medication. That's a peculiar problem - because there's no way to know which ones will work out and you need tons of money to look into specific molecules with no guarantee anything comes out of it. What is of interest here is the very subjective argumentation the chemists use to convince their department head that their molecule deserves more funding. 

For physics, I mean I'll gladly grant that it's much less ""subjective"". I don't want to say that we shouldn't be reasonably certain of the outcomes. Not at all. What I'm saying is that your statement that science is completely subjectivity free is wrong.  (And then again,  Quantum Mechanics interpretations are probably not testable , making it a matter of taste rather than empirical testing. To be fair tho, many physisicts don't subscribe to either interpretation)

-------------------------

I don't just say that. i say that as a student of philosophy of science. Pigliucci, who was quoted in the OP, is a biologist-turned-philosopher of biology and really knows what he's talking about.

[...]  
&gt; we would hope that no one we cared about acted in this way, or was in the position of A and C, for that matter. When we consider what is awry with each agent's conduct, the natural candidate is that the agent has proceeded without ascertaining that their partner is willing to have sex.

You also treat the year 94 as definitive when data you brought into the debate says it could have been 93, but that doesn't help your case does it. That puts us based solely on data you provided at a range of 57 and 64 years assuming that he wrote the book within the year it was published, a stretch even with modern keyboards.

&gt;The government allows atrazine to be used by not banning it.

If the government banned everything that research tentatively linked to side effects, society would non-figuratively be unable to function. That being said, the EU banned it so I'm on board with banning it, but it isn't like they're not reacting to a public health crisis. America's always been way too likely to err towards deregulation and money in politics doesn't help. It isn't deliberately hurting people, though; it is at most not proceeding with ostensibly reasonable caution for the time being.

&gt;I never said government agents dumped it in the water supply. 

Sorry for suggesting you did. The thread is explicitly suggesting they did.

&gt;Also it absolutely has effects on humans who consume it.

That's a really bad study. There's a lot wrong with it. I'm going to copy and paste some excerpts that make the ability to make inferences on the data basically null.

* Confounding variables out of the wazoo.

   ""Tap water in the Illinois communities had double the concentration of atrazine in the Vermont communities’ water. Nevertheless, the water in both states was far below the federal drinking water standard currently enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.""

   ""The researchers did not test the water for other contaminants.""

    ""“It is possible that the difference we found is due to pesticide exposure in general or another, unmeasured chemical in the drinking water,” said Cragin, who now is an epidemiologist at the Vermont Department of Public Health.""

   ""The authors said they considered lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, weight and foods, and found no significant differences between the two groups of women.""

They didn't control for anything besides physical activity, weight, and diet. Other contaminants were not controlled for. Both groups had very poor quality water dramatically raising the likelihood of some other contaminant, like the levels of lead in the water, being responsible.

* Small sample size.

   ""The small number of women involved in the study could increase the possibility that the differences between the two communities are due to chance. However, “to find a profoundly higher incidence of reproductive irregularities in such a small group of people suggests that something is definitely going on here,” said Laura Vandenberg, a reproductive scientist at Tufts University.

""Something"" being the operative word here. Small sample sizes makes the likelihood of statistically significant results much higher and if this didn't happen purely by chance, it is very difficult to connect to the levels of atrazine. 

&gt; But yes, I do think the government is turning a blind eye in a lot of serious environmental issues on purpose.

Oh, certainly, but this isn't one of the big examples. There's much bigger problems and it isn't the government intentionally making people suffer but being corrupt enough to allow corporations to get away with anything in exchange for financial kickbacks. 

&gt; Im not really hung up on the ""feminization"" part. 

That's what the thread is about. 

&gt; I just think it's much easier to control a population that is more docile. 

It isn't something nefarious like that.

&gt;Ranchers do it with cattle. Never be able to prove something like that though.

Ranchers don't use chemicals to turn their cows docile. Docility [is pretty heritable](https://extension.psu.edu/effects-of-docility-in-beef-cattle) so they just kill the cows that aren't docile. The remaining calm cows breed with each other and hopefully produce docile offspring. The government isn't doing anything of the sort through chemicals they're not regulating. 

&gt;Either way it, and other things like it should be banned.

Study up.  Know your hashes, binary trees (trees seem especially important -- binary trees are the most important, here, but it probably wouldn't hurt if you're familiar your balanced trees, red/black trees, and similar), and linked lists.  Know your big-O notation and be able to talk to it for any algorithm that you discuss.

Be ready to code on the board.  All of the interview questions are coding questions.  Get some practice -- have your friends throw questions at you and code-up your solutions in real-time, explaining why you're doing what you're doing.  Then give the O notation for the algorithm you've just coded up.  Also, expect to be asked if your solution scales up to the data-sets-of-enormous-size that Google tends to deal with.

Be enthusiastic.  Be excited about solving the problems that they're giving you.  I think one of my best answers was for a throw-away problem the interviewer gave me.  I gave him the classical answer to his question (which, it turns out, was all he really wanted) but told him that I figured they expected better than this because this is Google.  I came up with a more optimal solution and then refined it further.  His throw-away question became the entire interview but I think he liked how excited I got about the process.

Relax.  It's OK to be wrong once (_maybe_ twice).  If you clearly don't know the answer to a question, the interviewers are instructed to move on and not dwell on the problem.  Also, some of the interview questions might not have an optimal answer (it helps if you recognize an NP-complete problem if they give it to you) but, in those cases, they are looking for a good-enough solution.

Know that the Google interview is capricious.  Many truly brilliant programmers don't get hired because they got unfair questions or too-strict interviewers.

Tldr: Faculty member at a university got fired for faking a racial insult attack on himself. 

So to start at the beginning, during university I got a job working for the universities office of information technology. My job was to fix broken computers, software installs, data backup and recovery, ect. Pretty boring stuff. Over the years I had done a pretty good job and got promoted to student supervisor. (Go me) the position had higher pay and a fast track to full time if positions became available. It also put me in the position of handling out of the ordinary cases. 

One day a computer comes in and is handed to me. I'm told to back everything up to our server then make two duplicates onto external hard drives. Once done with the duplicates encrypt the drives and deliver them to two offices, one to the CIO,and one to university police along with the computer. A very strange request but okay. I do my thing, make the delivery and move on. My assumption at the time was that the computer was a recovered stolen laptop. It's not often we get them back but in some rare cases local stores/ pawn shops will get computers that were stolen from the campus brought in and the university pays them to have them returned, no big deal.

Later that day I go to class and get to chatting with a class mate. Turns out his class has Ben cancelled until further notice and the guy is reasonably freaking out. No disclosure was made about why the class is cancelled or when they will reconvene, whether he's going to be refunded or get credit, nothing. Well, now I'm interested. After class I got back to work and ask my boss what was up with that weird computer case. No dice, the man is an ex navy officer and won't say anything. So I go to the next best guy, a full time it consultant for the university I'm a bit chummy with. Man is notorious for not being able to keep his mouth shut. He gives me the full story. 

Rewind back to about a year ago and this instructor has complained that he is being harassed and threatened but racist students. He claims that these students where posting racist and defamatory remarks about him on public sites like rate my teacher and social media. Either way the posts and comments were from fake accounts with no background or relative ties so when he had complained to the university the basically said we cant do anything. This had gone on for the entirety of the last two semesters and University executives had gotten sick of it. So they asked our Network division to track the channels and sites Mr faculty member goes to so we can see what all it being posted and try to get to the bottom off it. (Side not all of the university computers are set up to be able to be tracked as long as you were on the universities network. Basically everyone knew this was how they were set up. Setup also uses a VPN to connect to the network when your at home. We caught a lot of instructors looking at porn with the setup.) After tracking the instructors traffic for a while the university got another complaint from him about yet another racist post. They checked the time the post in question was made and matched it to the time he was on that site, and put two and two together that he probably made the post himself. So that same day they went to collect his computer. (It was university property after all and they could do that) typically if we have to take a computer we provide the instructors with a loaner laptop to use. Really straight forward procedure, but Mr faculty was super against the it department seizing his computer and refused to give it up. To bad for him the request to seize his computer came from our title 9 department, meaning university police were involved. After being seized the laptop was to have all the data backup and duplicates made for security (that's where I came in.) Because of the nature of the event and the claim of racist threats and insults, the university had the department Mr faculty worked for cancel all his classes until they could complete the investigation. 

It took our security department about 30 minutes to find out that he had saved the username and password of the fake accounts to make it easier for himself to log in and post the racist comments.

[],Corpuscle,,,[],,,,text,t2_4xrnd,False,[],"There are a few problems with documenting average global temperature.

The first is that we really only have direct data going back 100-200 years. Climate changes happen over a *much* longer timespan than that. If you look at the indirect evidence (ice cores, tree rings, that stuff) you actually find that there's been a pretty steady global *cooling* trend over about the past 10,000 years. Not a big one, just a small change over that time, but the trend has been downward since roughly the beginning of recorded human history.

Before that, of course, we're looking at the last glacial period. Oh yeah, did I not mention? The earth is actually *in the middle of an ice age right now.* An ice age is defined as a period in which there are permanent ice caps, as there are today in the polar regions. We're in what's called an *interglacial,* which is a period within an ice age during which glaciers retreat toward a minimum before rebounding.

So we have evidence that over a very short span of time (in climatological terms) the average global temperature has changed. Okay. What does that *actually mean?* One thing we know for sure is that it does not pose an existential threat to humanity. We've been around and thriving for about 250,000 years. Over that period of time average global temperature has oscillated up and down by as much as 20°C. We can survive just fine over a wide temperature band.

So no, the state of affairs is not hopeless. It is in fact still totally within the bounds of normal variation.",1569527316,{},f1jscat,False,t3_d9onw7,False,True,t3_d9onw7,/r/AskReddit/comments/d9onw7/is_the_state_of_affairs_hopeless_when_it_comes_to/f1jscat/,1569527467.0,1,True,[],False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],ListenerNius,,,[],,,,text,t2_korxp,False,[],"In my area right now the minimum wage is $10.10 with an [average workweek of 35.26 hours](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-average-hours-per-week-worked-in-the-us-2060631), resulting in a gross annual income of about $18,500 for a minimum-wage worker. For each word of your wish, the result should be worth at least $185,000 just to adjust for lost wages. Obviously if you make more at your current job you'll need to inflate this number accordingly.

This doesn't account for the expected *growth* of a person's income over time. If we assume an [annual pay raise of 3.1%](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090415/salary-secrets-what-considered-big-raise.asp) we can determine that the same minimum-wage worker actually loses, on the `y`th year, `18500 * (1.031 ^ y)`, or $25,130 on the 10th year. During the first decade the wishmaker actually loses a total of about $220,000.

That's only the fiscal losses for working time, and is fairly conservative in that it assumes no major growths such as promotions, education, or chance opportunities.

Estimating the value of the lost *non-working* time is a bit harder.

Using the available US statistical data to quantify the value of a human life, a human life is [valued at about $9.6 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life#United_States). In the United States the average life expectancy is about [79 years](https://www.google.com/search?q=average+life+span+usa&amp;oq=average+life+span+usa&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2399j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). From this we can gather that a single year is worth about $122,000 and ten years is worth $1,220,000.

This is a slightly better figure than we would get if we assumed a minimum working wage for *all* lost hours in the decade (about $1.05 million) so we'll go with this number instead.

For your wish to break even fiscally, the *very first word* of your wish needs to add $1.22 million in value to the result of the wish.

But if your wish simply replaces the $1.22 million you didn't make in your lost ten years then there was really no point in making it anyway. For you to be bothered to make such a wish the subsequent ten years, or longer, needs to be significantly *better* than the years you gave up.

An easy benchmark to accomplish this would be to say ""the next ten years needs to be better than those years and the lost years combined"". Using the figures from before, the second year is worth about $298,390 in working hours or $1.43 million in total hours (better than the US statistics at $1.22 million, because of the assumed growth in income). The value of the first word of your wish needs to be at least $1.43 million for the decade following the lost years, plus $1.22 million for the lost years themselves, for a total of $2.65 million at a minimum.

To wish for any amount of money takes several words. ""I wish for one Xillion dollars"" is six words, or sixty years. Fortunately we can use any prefix we like in place of the ""X"" to inflate the number to an order of magnitude that will draw a profit. Unfortunately, in order break even on sixty years valued at minimum wage for every hour lived (about $15.5 billion) the word would need to be ""trillion"". Fortunately 1 trillion is so much bigger than 15.5 billion that we can safely ignore the demand for a higher quality of life in the following years.

One could say that to reasonably make even a single wish they would need to wish for at least a trillion dollars, or something else *worth* that much.

Most people value their time at considerably more than $10.10 per hour, especially when they consider quality time with kids, vacations, and quiet mornings on the front porch.

So, if anyone is interested, here’s a kind of explanation to people who don’t science from someone else who doesn’t science. 

All images you’ve seen of black holes before this one aren’t actually photos of black holes, they’re just really good guesses. This image was immensely groundbreaking because scientists got to see if their guesses had been right - which they pretty much were! 

The project to collect the image took telescopes all over the world and many many months, with a team of hundreds of people from astronomers to data processors. It was called Event Horizon, which refers to the exact spot on a black hole after which visual or physical entry/view becomes impossible, and at the moment that you cross the horizon, there’s no saving you from the black hole. So the picture is basically a picture OF the event horizon, and it’s the clearest and closest ever managed. 

It was unveiled at a live stream at 7 different locations all over the world earlier this year. It’s an amazing feat. 

Also to get back to the telescope thing, basically, a black hole is so big that we don’t have anything big enough to capture an image of it. So the event horizon telescopes we’re basically a team of them spread across the globe connected by radio - creating a radio telescope network, that basically simulated one gigantic ass telescope big enough to snap a photo (or like hundreds of thousands of small ones and then compile them into a big one actually).",1569486068,{},f1h5lds,False,t3_d978d2,False,True,t1_f1fbagv,/r/AskReddit/comments/d978d2/what_scientific_photos_are_hard_to_believe_but/f1h5lds/,1569486078.0,1,True,[],False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; Again, no idea where you're getting your numbers from.

http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/184/

The intertubes are amazing. It even has databases for things like that.

Sure there are some big’uns, but most of them are tiny. On average, an adult mammal is smaller than a house cat.

&gt; 5) Again, no source for numbers.

The aforementioned database has data on food requirements. It works out to an average of 980 grams per day. (Remember, the two elephants may eat much, but the thousand tiny rodents not so much.) Most larger animals eat less than 15% of their body weight a day (mostly around 2-3%), but I calculated 15% just to make it harder for myself. If they’re less than 1kg, I calculated 100% of body weight a day just to be sure. This leaves *huge* margins for errors.

I classified each animal into a food category like Carnivore, herbivore, frugivore, etc. Then assigned the average density to each food category from straw at 120 kg/m3 to potatoes at 1100 kg/m3. Running the calculations on the database yielded a volume of 2.4 liters per day. (This is skewed toward low density food to really put a strain on the volume requirements, btw. No stone left unturned to make the margin of error as big as possible.)

Sadly I couldn’t find similar databases for birds or reptiles, but considering birds are smaller and reptiles are cold blooded, I think it’s fair to say a mammal is a roughly equal stand-in.

&gt; we're talking about a boat 

Why? Where they in a hurry to get anywhere fast? 

Show me the scripture where god says “Noah, Build me a speedboat. And you must make it look like a big canoe, perfectly streamlined, with a deck for playing shuffleboard.”

“Ark” means “box”. It was essentially a huge cubish barge. It had a water line depth of ~3.2 meters fully loaded, a strong righting arm and a very high meta center, making it incredibly stable. The dimensional ratios of the ark are still used in engineering today for their stability. 

My calculations even takes into account wall thickness, floor thickness, inner structures like pillars, ramps, dividing walls etc.

Not many of us do.

I come from a country where drugs aren't advertised or even sold, generally speaking, other than paracetamol or lemsip and the like. You have to get a prescription and even then many doctors won't offer you medicine if they think you haven't been excersising or been eating well. We do have doctors who are under pressure and might go the drug route to cut corners, but they are the exception and most would frown upon this type of practice. Unless drugs are absolutely necessary to your treatment, you'll only get them as a last resort due to the  side-effects medication can have. 

We do have vaccines for our children but they aren't forced upon the population. And you certainly wouldn't be shamed for abstaining. Doctors are dilligent about explaining the implications but there's no strong-arming, or the type of shaming I think this post is trying to achieve.

The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)​​​​​​​ in our atmosphere, as of 2018, is the highest it has been in 3 million years.

2016 ​was the warmest year on record.
NASA and NOAA data show that global averages in 2016 were 1.78 degrees F (0.99 degrees C) warmer than the mid-20th century average. Seventeen of the 18 warmest years have occurred since 2000.

800 million people - eleven percent of the world’s population is currently vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, heat waves, extreme weather events and sea-level rise.

There are so many holes to the story. Her family describes her as honest but she’s secretly texting people on anonymous text apps. (Further, the apps are based in the states and therefore follow different laws.... as far as I know Canadian police are still “trying” to obtain the messages but I use the term “trying” loosely, because it seems like they could not give less of a fuck.) she never goes to school with a backpack, then on this day goes with a full backpack... but nothing is missing from her room so it’s a kidnapping? But her school stuff is left at the school. 

They released, over a year after her disappearance, some additional information - like that she asked an adult woman for help booking a hotel room, for example, or drawing attention to the backpack issue.... over a year after said backpack could have been dumped in a landfill and is therefore no help to anyone looking for her. 

Around the same time the police are releasing this information, they’re also drawing up links to a sex trafficking ring that could run from Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon, and Edmonton - that’s 3 provinces, and Bali is from what I would call the Regina area. 

Oh... and there’s a hefty reward, most of which was anonymously donated. 

The creepiest part to me is that this girl keeps getting shoved in my face. I do not pay attention to missing persons very often. But her story sticks out to me, especially because she’s talking to boys on apps like Kik. I’m from the area she’s from.

[],LadyCooke,,,[],,,,text,t2_anan5,False,,"Fear of #MeToo.

Now, please read the following before reacting and/or replying:

I think the #metoo movement is so important and so necessary - the general message/purpose behind it being to show the world the real data, the real faces, of the women who have experienced sexual assault and how commonplace and big of an issue it is - but I also do understand that with the political and social climate surrounding #metoo, it having created more awareness surrounding the seriousness of believing women, men have a fear of being the victim of a dishonest person. 

BUT, women have dealt with men claiming consent when there wasn't, when it was true assault or rape, for our entire lives (I am a victim myself-of a family member). We were and definitely still are WAY too often never believed or taken seriously, with mens' word being taken over ours despite what should be sufficient evidence of the contrary. So, in that sense and through that fact, I think men could find some empathy and understanding.

Nonetheless, I've spoken to men who are genuinely scared that something they did as a young dude, like taking body language and reciprocation of advances as consent without verbally asking ""are you wanting to have sex?"", will one day land them in a court room when that person, despite reciprocation without manipulation, claims no verbal consent, thus sexual assault.

Although that's a fear that comes with the necessary, and I'd say the benefit of #metoo FAR outweighs the negative of men's fear of being wrongly charged as it is SO SOOOO unlikely, it's still a new fear they face nonetheless that I can understand the reason behind and prob does suck (Obv. ONLY in cases where a man genuinely did not commit such acts and is the victim of a lie).

[],Julford,,,[],,,,text,t2_yzkud,False,,"I cry a lot at video games, especially big moments that tie heavily into storytelling themes of the game/series. Most recent time I cried though was NieR:Automata, during its ending [E] credit sequence. To set the stage:

*BIG SPOILERS FOR NIER:AUTOMATA*

-One of the core facets to the second half of NieR:Automata's story is the isolation the main characters feel after an incident. 9S is er... ""seperated"" from 2B, and his mental state is rapidly deteriorating. A2 is also a huge loner, and tries to do everything by herself. By the end of the game, both of them die, 9S potentially finding salvation if the player chooses to have him move past his hatred of machines to live among then.

-During the credits for Automata, the player is sent through a lengthy bullet hell shooter segment, and each time they fail they see messages from other players, encouraging them to carry on. After enough failures, you are offered assistance from these other players. If you reject the help, each time you die it will be offered again.

-When you eventually accept the offer for help, the credits music surges from a single singer to an entire choir, and you become effectively invincible; any further damage destroys the ship of one of the assisting players (complete with message saying ""[Player]'s data has been lost"").

The entirety of that moment damn near broke me. Worse is when you do finally finish the credits sequence, the game asks you to honor those who helped you, by making the same sacrifice they did: upload your data, wiping your save file from the system. I'd figured something to this effect was coming (the first Nier had a similar choice for its 100% ending), but the context given really struck me hard. Still I soldiered on, sent my data off, watched the game delete my game file section by section, and then it dropped the phrase.

My title is network architect, but I see myself as Sr network engineer and team lead/mentor at this point as our network is stable and doesn't need me to re-architect it now.
How I got where I am... I studied everything related to Cisco networking while I was in the military.  My first job out was in a NOC and I made sure I learned everything I could.  Routing changes being done, I studied the config; monitoring server no one else knew how to get up when it crashed, I learned how to get it restarted; SNA connections to registers no one wanted to touch, I learned it and I always kept my mouth shut unless I KNEW I was right (always do this y'all, always).  6 months later one of the guys pulled me too a new job he'd gotten with a big company that kills bugs to help setup their WAN and I've had 5 more jobs since, each time bring brought to a new company by a boss or co-worker.  In the beginning, I made sure I got at least 10k/yr salary increase with each job change.  Then finally my big break came when I left a financial company because I hadn't had a raise in 3 years.  Got a 15k raise moving to the new job and then 8 months later the financial company's president called and asked me to return as the people they hired to replace me had messed up connectivity to a huge customer.  I got an additional 30k/yr to come back, given network manager title and ability to hire my own team.  Finally broke the 6 figure barrier.  Sky I'm not with them any more, took a new position with an old boss that I respected a few years ago for another nice raise.  The constant is that I always learn my network fully when I move to a new company and I'll always help those I left behind for a bit after I'm gone.  I may not be paid, but I'm building relationships that will last forever. When I go to a new job, I want to know everything, every little obscure connection, every server that's only used once a year for a special purpose and I always start fixing things that are causing outages before anything else.  This shows management you're dedicated to customers and want to increase their faith in the company.  Then I inject myself into ALL outages: get on the calls and ask questions, look at things, give advice, take note.  Then review and see if there is anything in your area of expertise that can prevent the outages.  The biggest thing, I think, is I'm always truthful, never sugar coat and I'll fight you if you blame something on my network when I know it's not because I've got the data to prove it.

The *real* good stuff is [right here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053) with the Megatron transformer, but you need to read the paper to see it..

&gt; **Context**: There is a major force uniting Americas fiercely
&gt; partisan politicians: big technology companies. Democrats
&gt; and Republicans at the federal and state levels are coming
&gt; together to scrutinize the power of the Silicon Valley giants
&gt; and, potentially, to rein them in. Letitia James, the Demo-
&gt; cratic attorney general of New York, announced on Friday
&gt; that attorneys general in eight states four Democrats and
&gt; four Republicans and the District of Columbia had begun
&gt; an antitrust investigation of Facebook.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Megatron-LM**: The probe, which Ms. James said was
&gt; likely to result in a lawsuit, is the latest in a string of high-
&gt; profile regulatory actions, in state and federal courts, that
&gt; challenge the market dominance of tech companies. The
&gt; Justice Department is also investigating Facebook’s data
&gt; practices and whether the company violated a 2011 consent
&gt; decree with the Federal Trade Commission that required
&gt; the company to obtain explicit consent from users before
&gt; sharing their personal information with third parties.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What might prompt a bipartisan coalition to sue Facebook?
&gt; It isn’t clear that there’s any one thing. But lawmakers and
&gt; regulators have been increasingly alarmed by the company’s
&gt; recent controversies, which include a data breach affecting
&gt; more than 50 million users, the spread of fake news on
&gt; the platform, and the spreading of propaganda by Russian-
&gt; backed accounts during the 2016 election.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It’s also not clear how serious the Democratic attorneys gen-
&gt; eral are about filing a lawsuit. While the attorneys general
&gt; announced their investigation in a press release, they said
&gt; they had not yet reached a decision on whether to sue. In
&gt; the past, some of the attorneys general have focused their
&gt; efforts on trying to extract settlements from the tech compa-
&gt; nies without filing lawsuits.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ”As attorneys general who have investigated and prosecuted
&gt; health-care fraud, price-fixing, and other violations of our
&gt; states’ antitrust laws, we are committed to holding compa-
&gt; nies accountable when they fail to protect consumers and
&gt; competition in the market,” Ms. James said in a statement.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The investigation, which was first reported by The New
&gt; York Times, was announced as the companies that dom-
&gt; inate the tech industry are facing scrutiny from antitrust
&gt; regulators around the world. Google, Twitter, Facebook
&gt; and Amazon have faced a series of antitrust probes and
&gt; class-action lawsuits in the United States and Europe ...

Now, at this point my parents are divorced and had been for years. I was super curious why my mom had photos of her and my dad when I knew they did not get along. I was in 6th grade during this time but I was EXTREMELY sheltered. So here I was, thinking that there was some old pictures of my parents happy together. I stick the dvd in my computer and load it up.

Here are a few facts:
The recordings are for training machine learning models. If you ask Alexa something and she doesn’t understand or give you the wrong info, chances you’ll ask again in a slower and clearer voice. Then the first missed recognition is used to train the model to be better. Be it an accent, slang word, or just a noisy environment. 
The recordings are also to recognize your voice when linked. That way the assistant knows who is asking “what’s my schedule like” and can pull up the correct calendar. 
The “people listening” was when there was voice but no text inferred. They used humans to transcribe what was said, again to train the model. 

Onto advertising. As of today, none of the smartphones listen for it. Some apps in Asia and the Middle East need to be downloaded, installed, and run in the background for this to work. People download them for the same reason Nielsen ‘s devices are popular here: get free stuff (promo or channels). In return they get data on who views what ad and when. 

None of the big assistant companies (Alexa, Google assistant, Cortana) use any background noise to infer metadata about the user. Shit, they can’t even understand voice reliability so they’re focusing on that first. 

The myth that “your phone is listening to you” has been dispelled over and over. It’s easy to see when a phone sends data, and where. There are some privacy issues with smart phones that are worth addressing:
-	Bluetooth Low Energy beacon saving with location are always scanning
-	Cell carriers selling your triangulated location history to anyone
-	The list of domains you visit (via DNS snuffing) look how upset the telco are that Google is trying to encrypt that. 
-	WiFi + Location scanned and uploaded automatically (Any WiFi, not just yours)
-	Airport and malls using the phone’s MAC address for either WiFi of Bluetooth to tag shoppers and build a precise profile. This is automatically happening as the phone searches for networks.

- this does not need to run 24/7. if it runs the detection at two or three random times a day for a few minutes you will never notice an effect on battery life. advertising and “big data” is a numbers game. You do not need to detect all contacts of every single one to gain an advantage. 

- detecting a signal like that is not extremely computationally expensive and it’s not comparable to voice recognition. All you need is a short identifier, 32 bits would be plenty. The simplest way would be to send a series of pulses on a defined inaudible frequency. Then all you have to do is detect the edges in this very narrow part of the spectrum.  For voice recognition you need to find much more complex patterns in a much wider part of the spectrum. And we had working software for that at least since the days of windows 95. 

And then you can “optimize”: the phone is playing a video or running a game? Let the detection run more often with a very low priority, so it’s not noticeable and the battery life expectancy is not that great in the first place. Or let it run more often when ads on tv and contacts with other people are more likely. Then the message can be even shorter if it’s content and schedule is set by your ad server. e.g. phone a is scheduled to send “134” at 5am and phone b is scheduled to send “134” at 7:35pm. If phone c hears “134” it sends that and the time to the server which can then identify the sender.

Steam is already a data aggregator, so you'd need to make peace with that. You can reduce some of the baggage by cracking any games you download so they don't use the Steam overlay anymore. Probably against the terms of service, but so is everything. Also any online game probably has an analytics/telemetry package built in (and they'll often scan your system for cookies to connect your web browsing habits with the game/account), so keep that in mind.

General tips are use a more privacy-focused browser, with a solid ad-blocker (look for one that catches redirects and external advertising calls). Firefox being the better of the big three, but they've had their missteps (look up the Mr Robot fiasco). If you want to go a stop further you can install a more specialized browser like Brave. A VPN hides your data from your ISP, but doesn't do much to protect you from the actual websites you use. Set any browser to automatically clear cooking/data to reduce the amount that Facebook/Google/etc can track you. Notice those ""like"" or ""login-with-facebook"" buttons? Those are all tracking vectors.

On your phone, basic steps are to disable wifi and bluetooth whenever you're outside the home. Use the web versions of any services instead of the native apps (as the web versions can't run in the background the same and don't have easy access to mics and can't as easily mine your system for data).

Now I can't really say any of the direct data you provided is wrong, but your tone speaks of a few misconceptions.  


&gt; Ok??? We have nuclear waste that will be a hazard for a very long time. This still will be hazardous for an amount of time that potentially reaches past human existence on this planet. 

Well that is false. Radioactive material follows the laws of physics, which means a high energy ouput will lead to quick decay, and a low energy output will mean it stays active for longer. (see half-life)  
A high energy output usually means that it is hazardous to human health (the stuff that burns your skin, is glowing, and in general is just a disaster to have around) but that also means it burns out faster.  
Low energy ouput will stay radioactive for a long time, think hundreds, if not thousands of years, but it is constantly decaying and something that stays radioactive for thousands of years, has an energy ouput that really makes it kinda not that big of a threat. This is the stuff that is usually buried deep in the ground, where it's weaksauce radiation can't get anywhere.  


The energy output also affects the wavelength of the radiation, so once again (afaik) high energy, longer wavelength, more dangerous. But again, shorter halflife.  
I'm not well versed enough in nuclear physics to say how much the radiation density (half life) affects the direct danger levels, but someone can probably chime in with that info. But for instance a low half-life, with a long radiation wave (high energy particle), would be a material that has a low radiation density, as it would only fire off a few particles over a given unit of time. I'd assume that this would again make it less dangerous, even if it had high energy particles, compared to something with similar wavelenght of radiation but shorter half-life.  


But my point is: You either have high-risk material, that burns out wuick, or low-risk material that is radiactive for a long time. There is no high-risk material that is radioactive for a long time.  


It's true that there are materials that will stay radioactive for longer than the human race will exist on this planet, but the radiation levels of those materials are less than the uranium that we originally pulled from the ground. And peole aren't exactly dying in droves over that stuff being there either.  
As a sidenote: Bananas are also radioactive, fun times!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; We have places like The Hanford site, it's hotter than Paris during the summer of 2019. This place alone has almost 920,000 m\^3 of high level waste. One location contains a volume of waste that would take up half the storage capacity of the worlds largest oil super tanker 

You probably do! And as I said, America refuses to recycle their spent fuel, which is why you end up with those kinds of problems. Run it again, like we do in europe, and you would get a whole lot less of a problem, and a bunch of electricity to boot!  


As for that ""one location"", allright, it contains spent fuel from how many reactors over how long of a time-period? How many miljon MW's of power has that spent fuel created? And it has enough waste to fill **half** of **one** oil super tanker. It really does not take a genious to realize that **that is not a lot of waste.**  
And it could be less, if you guys just recycled the fuel-rods.  


You keep saying that it is tricky to get rid of the spent fuel, but it really isn't all that tricky imo. We have taken the original radioactive material from the ground, we have spent a large portion of it's energy in creating electricity, and now we put it back. It hasn't gotten **more** radioactive (though you could argue density due to enriching and what's left being of a smaller volume), and what gets put back in the ground reaches the original uraniums radiation levels in 40-50 years. (in Europe).  


Well, that's my take on the whole thing. To be fair, I'm not a nuclear phycisist, I'm a thermal engineer, so a lot of what I say might be misunderstandings due to oversimplification in my sources.

&gt;How do you know?

Because the two firearms pictured, aside from the handgun, that could take a magazine California labels as ""high capacity"" looks to be an AR-15 and an AK-47. The AK-47 and it's variants have had a 30 round magazine as standard for decades. The AR-15 is commonly sold using magazines that fit NATO's draft STANAG regarding magazines which defines their standardization as being either 20 or 30 rounds. 

&gt;Not according to some classifications it seems

Yes according to the arbitrary and capricious decision of anti-gun lawmakers in California they have said that they completely redefine the standard according to how they want to be, despite what almost every other state in the country says.

&gt;Is it? Who says?

Can you provide any data to show any impact that they have had, other than greatly inconveniencing other law abiding citizens? Because from where I'm sitting it's a stupid law since it doesn't actually do anything to actual criminals and instead impacts only law abiding citizens.

It's funny, because in your completely biased opinion you have determined this ""is entirely correct."" As if you are stating a fact. Pot meet kettle.

&gt;Also, you have no idea whether the magazines were 30 or 60 rounds, you just made a ton of assumptions, applied your own opinion as fact and correct someone who didnt need correcting.

Considering cops would love to show off big scary drum magazines to show how they are taking these dangerous things off the streets, and the fact that the weapons taken from him by police are pictured in the article, it's a pretty safe inference that they are in fact standard capacity as defined by almost everyone except California.

[],Pleeb,,,[],,,,text,t2_7qa9c,False,,"In my sensory and perception class, my professor told me a story about a patient of his.

She would be sitting down watching TV, then she moved over a little, and suddenly the TV disappeared!  She could see the wall (and wallpaper patterns) behind the TV, but the Television itself was gone.  Later, she was driving.  Oncoming cars would approach her, but suddenly vanish!  Seconds later, the cars would re-appear, closer to her.  She thought she was going crazy.

When she came in, they found out that the blind spot in her eye was slightly larger than normal, and the brain was just generating what it thought was there, since there was no visual information.  See, everyone has a blind spot, and [you can find yours here](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chvision.html).  You don't actually see the black hole in your vision though, because the brain takes the resulting patterns and ""fills in"" what it expects to see.

What's cooler is, when you look at a big red circle with a thick black background, the cells in your eyes that are looking at the filled in color are actually sending no information to the brain.  The eyes just send the borders and the border colors, and the brain just sends the perception of that circle to you, you're not actually seeing everything.

Your brain really does seem to just take a bunch of raw data from your eyes (patterns, light, shadows, etc) and reconstruct the world around you.  The coffee cup on the coaster to your left?  You're only seeing it there because the patterns of that cup made its way into your visual cortex, the brain took note of the location and the object, reconstructed a 3d world around you, and placed that cup there.

When things go wrong, you can [even start seeing things in reverse](https://i.imgur.com/q1BIRf5.png).  I will have to dig up my sensory/perception book to find it, but there was a person who had damage to their ""where"" pathway, and actually saw their coffee cup on the left side of their field of view when it was actually on the right.  It wasn't until they reached for something that wasn't there when they realized the objects on their desk where cognitively in the wrong spot!

Even worse when the ""what"" pathway is damaged.  You could see a coffee up, you can draw it with accuracy, but you wouldn't be able to recognize that it's a coffee cup.  You just won't know what you're looking at.

Like FTL being possible by skipping thru one of the other dimensions physicists are saying exist. Or harnessing energy from those dimensions. Or whatever else you can come up with.

Define the technology rigidly in how it functions, if possible with more data points drawn from technology. Like: FTL only works far away from gravity wells because inverted square law. Energy shields aren't bubbles but work by diverting energy to a different dimension.

Draw conclusions from these definitions: because ships have to travel a long time in normal space before they can go into FTL, fighting in real space is still the norm and you can't just FTL warp directly to planets. Local lower dimensions can be satuated with energy and then the shields stop working. Possibly violently so.

Then conclude further and use all these conclusions to drive your story. Since we can defend star systems but enemies can come from any directions, we need mobile fleets to fight, not space stations.

&gt;USB hub

USB hubs can suck for gaming. games will sometimes detect input from every controller plugged in, so you can get ghost inputs if an axis has drift, and its annoying to wonder where it comes from until you realize its a device you arent even using. or you are driving with a steering wheel and the cat comes up on the desk and sits on your gamepad and makes you crash. 

USB hubs can also introduce device input latency, and in hardcore gaming, milliseconds matter. last, sometimes windows gets confused about controllers on hubs. it expects drivers to work for a certain USB port, so moving it around can make it stop working. (granted, this is an argument to leave them plugged in...but god forbid you want to clean the desk and unplug/replug everything) i find it better to just not use USB hubs, ever. id rather pay extra for a better motherboard with more USB ports.

personally, i find it much more reliable to unplug devices not being used. plug whatever i need directly into the computer, and get it working, and then dont fuck with it until ive totally finished the game (a few weeks/months). even then occasionally devices stop working, sometimes because of a windows update, firmware update, game patch, etc. taking the hub out of the equation makes troubleshooting a lot less frustrating, and when you are trying to relax by gaming, it makes a big difference.

the device latency from a hub is also a problem for music. you try to play in time, you hit an electric piano key, or a drum pad on the beat, but its not registered until a few ms later, making it sound off-tempo.",1567999150,{},ezn040m,False,t3_d1g5rz,False,True,t1_ezmxcnm,/r/todayilearned/comments/d1g5rz/til_in_2014_former_mit_employee_ethan_zuckerman/ezn040m/,1567999161.0,1,True,[],False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal people produce colors via a combination of data from each of 3 cones that have their own range of sensitivities to certain wavelengths of light. We detect what wavelengths are present using each of our cones to detect them, add them up, and our brains map this data to a spectrum of experiences called ""color"". A tetrachromat has 4 cones but over a similar range of wavelengths - 1 cone is just really sensitive to a specific wavelength range that the other three aren't. And it gives tetrachromats a fourth ""dimension"", or source of information really, to generate their internal spectrum of colors with. While we're working with 3 data points to make our colors, they're using 4, so they experience a much more detailed range of colors than we do, but it's not like things are glowing or a totally different color to them than they are to us.

&gt; The strange thing about the abundance of Water in our Universe is not the fact that there is so much of it – *but rather the fact that is has taken as long as it has for the sheer amount of water in interstellar space to be confirmed.*


I posted the article (from 2015) to demonstrate that our knowledge about the matter out there changed *recently*. Some excerpts from the JPL link: 

&gt; NASA science activities have provided a wave of amazing findings related to water in **recent years**

and here

&gt; Hubble Space Telescope **recently** provided powerful evidence that Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean 

and here

&gt; **More recently**, NASA scientists using ground-based telescopes were able to estimate the amount of water Mars has lost over the eons.

and

&gt; **Recently** verifying its thousandth exoplanet, Kepler data confirm that the most common planet sizes are worlds just slightly larger than Earth. Astronomers think many of those worlds could be entirely covered by deep oceans. 

and 

&gt; NASA's Cassini mission has revealed Enceladus as an active world of icy geysers. **Recent** research suggests it may have hydrothermal activity on its ocean floor, an environment potentially suitable for living organisms.

Wealth distribution will vary over time, again take the great depression, americans were living paycheck to paycheck for a decade. They weren't for many decades after ww2. Saying you shouldn't have a kid during the depression 1930s is basically what you are saying here, I am saying that these things vary from decade to decade and so it is short term thinking to overweight this impact when in fact the proportion of time in someones life that they would be living paycheck to paycheck is likely to be small, because there are political mechanisms in place for when it gets too bad.

The climate argument IMO is a misnomer because we don't know with good certainty that the world is going to shit, the climate models have to build in what humans will do over time, and how the planet will react. We know humanity is changing the climate, we know it could get bad enough to warrant not having a child (I'll set a high prob at like 10% chance in 2100?), but saying there is this chance it is going to shit, and therefore it is the worse time to have a child, is quite a stretch.

Because of the uncertainty inherent in this, and how far out it is, I think it makes more sense to think of creating life as making another player to go on the human journey.

Someone told them I knew about computers- I had a PC I ran a BBS on in my barracks room, so word got around about the weird guy with the computer, I guess.

I go down there in my PT gear (sweatpants and a t-shirt) and, rubbing sleep out of my eyes, meet this CPT who is just panicking- he's got some kind of presentation to give to someone *way* up the food chain, and needs his Harvard Graphics slides (Harvard Graphics was sort of like a proto-Powerpoint for 286 systems back in the 80s and early 90s), but the computer says it has a password and he can't get in.

I knew they didn't set passwords on the computers in the S3 shop, because it would create situations like this. Someone screwed up, or something glitched and set a boot password. 

I pulled out the manual and it said that you if the password wasn't working you could send it to Zenith and they'd fix it and send it back.

Looking at the chip I recognized it as being the type you could store small amounts of data on- so, while this captain was freaking out because if I broke the computer he'd be responsible- I pulled the chip out, turned the computer back on and it booted without a problem.

[],Samhain27,,,[],,,,text,t2_158e76,False,,"Although the phrase certainly does exist, even in Japan, I feel the constant need to point out that Japan ISN’T “non religious”. It’s a pet peeve. 

A lot of people online like to characterize the nation as somehow being devoid of any kind of faith. Especially those insufferable cross-breeds of weeaboos and “my atheism is euphoric” types. It doesn’t help that the Japanese people themselves routinely deny religiousness. 

What I’ve taken this to mean, having now lived in Japan for some years, is that they aren’t religious the way the west is religious. Meaning they don’t subscribe to Christianity/Judaism/Islam. Which is fair enough. But religion is big business here as it is most everywhere. Temples and shrines would not succeed without wealthy patrons buying salvation, waves of tourism, or just a small, local group of the faithful. People to this day still have Buddhist altars in their homes, too. Lastly, while I don’t have any data-supported proof of this claim, I suspect Japan has quite a few more cults than America. It seems like every time I turn around there is some new new age religion.

One thing I will concede, though, is that the Japanese people put a lot of emphasis on ritual versus the metaphysical substance behind the ritual. Few people can really tell you who/what is enshrined where and why it’s important. But they know they need to worship it. That doesn’t mean there is zero faith involved, of course. Still, the emphasis seems to be on ritual for rituals’ sake. Which is likely also, on top of not understanding/being famous in movies, why the western wedding is so prevalent. It’s not really about the Christian overtones or the contract between man and wife; it’s just about the ritual and aesthetics.

As a culture in general, I find a lot of Japanese people do things that they don’t really think deeply about at all. They’ve just always done it, so it naturally must have value. In this way, the ritual itself is emphasized over the object of ritual reverence. Of course this happens in western nations, too, but at least in my experience, Americans seem much more suspicious of this sort of thing and are quick to ask “why”.

&gt;The 588-page report commissioned by Dairy Farmers of Canada examined the role subsidies play in the U.S. dairy market. According to the report, **73% of the returns received by U.S. dairy farmers in 2015 were a result of dairy farm subsidies**, such as the Margin Protection Program (MPP), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and others. That amounts to about $12.06 per cwt.

[Source](https://www.dairyherd.com/article/canada-73-us-milk-price-subsidized)

Since you will yell ""bias"" as that is from a Canadian source, here are some other sources discussing the US government subsidizing milk production and bailing out the industry, despite lagging demand:  


&gt;**Subsidies:** According to the federal government,  almost 1.4 billion pounds of surplus cheese now sit in refrigerated  warehouses around the country. Yet dairy production is climbing. What  gives?  
&gt;  
&gt;The amount of surplus cheese is growing fast — up 6% in just the past year.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to news accounts, the reason is that dairy production is  climbing, while dairy consumption is falling. Data from the Department  of Agriculture show that between 2008 and 2017, milk production in the  U.S. climbed 13%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over those same years, however, consumption has sagged — with per capita milk consumption down 14%, USDA data show.  
&gt;  
&gt;The surplus milk gets stored as cheese. If formed into one giant  wheel, the current 1.39-billion-pound cheese surplus would be about as  big as the U.S. Capitol Building.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two years ago, the Obama administration effectively bailed out the  industry, when it bought up $20 million worth — 11 million pounds — of  cheese, which it then used for food assistance programs. But the  stockpile has grown 16% since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;By interfering with pricing signals, the effect of these subsidies  has been to encourage production, almost regardless of market demand.  It's a problem not just with the dairy industry, but with other  agricultural products on the receiving end of government largesse.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Each year, in fact, taxpayers fork over more than $20 billion to subsidize corn, soybeans, wheat,** ***\[****all three primarily feed crops for livestock, btw****\]*** **cotton, rice, dairy and a few other commodities. Critics of these subsidies say that not only do these  programs distort the market, but they tend to benefit big agribusinesses  at the expense of family farms.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The 2014 bill was supposed to include provisions to prevent dairy overproduction, but clearly it hasn't worked as intended.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dairy farmers say they need these programs to survive. We doubt that.  Like every other industry, they'd learn to adapt to market changes.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime, ask yourself this question: Why should taxpayers  hand over their hard-earned money to protect other people's jobs in a  declining industry?

&gt; Transistors is a weird way to measure compute power rather than, say, FLOPS, if you're trying to estimate the theoretical CPU load of whole brain emulation. Maybe you were trying to speak more generally(i.e. CPU/RAM/disk)? But then again, ""transistor"" is a clumsy term to use if you're talking about memory cells, plus you mentioned an AMD chip and failed to mention RAM or disk, for which brain matter is also presumably responsible, so, yeah...

Regardless of the use, we can look at transistors and capacitors as kind of the key component of any system - cpu, ram, disk, whatever.  I over-simplify this for the sake of brevity to say ""a neuron"" cannot be represented as a single transistor - is must be represented as some collection of transistors.  We can sort of see this in Tesla's custom ASIC for holding its many different models that add up to some form of intelligence - in this case full automated vehicle control.  The ASIC is loaded with a model, or many models, which are stored in memory, and the chips themselves utilize the models.   You could go high flexibility in the form of a chipset that is primarily made of an FPGA, but we're getting into what's the best way to implement these models, as opposed to discussing the general complexity of these models.  Suffice to say, if we look at the building block of a brain as a neuron, the building block of a neuron can probably be represented as some number of transistors.

So, the reason I used transistors as a base-line for showing how far away we are from a general intelligence like the one doomsayers shout about is that in order to be sufficiently flexible and general to represent a wide-scale threat like this, the system needs to be somewhere between current super computer complexity and human complexity just in terms of compute power.  We've reached (or will be rapidly approaching) clock limits due to thermal issues - especially as transistors shrink and counts increase.  Likewise, we're approaching the end of moores law just by nature quantum physics (going below 5-7 nm is basically no possible because electrons can just bloop over the gap without regard to the gate, i'm over-simplifying but this is basically the gist of it)

So in terms of hardware speed, we're capping out here in terms of transistor capacity of high-density cores and clock speed.  This is why you see core counts increase, rather than clock speed or transistor count.  We've only got a couple more steps on each of those left, but we're going to start seeing 1000+ core models in desktops, and racks containing thousands 100's of thousands of cores in data centers, and exa-scale and beyond super computers containing millions of cores.

So lets talk in terms of Titan.  It has about 44.86 trillion transistors.   Our brains have around 100 trillion **synaptic connections** - which you can extrapolate however you like to determine how many ""transistors"" that equates to, i used 1000 transistors for funsies because i've seen others use that number as rough estimates.  All those connections put us (human beings) at about 1 Exaflop of computational ability in the human brain **with the ability to not only adjust neurons individually, but also to create or destroy synaptic connections** - which you can view somewhat like our brain being a big giant FPGA on a biological level.  

Our greatest super computer operates at about 10 peta-flops.  Meaning we're about 1/100th of the way toward producing a machine that rivals complexity of a human brain.  If we view it that way, and things are relatively linear (i'm being extremely generous), that means we need a machine with like 4.4 QUADRILLION transistors to successfully model a full human brain - just on a hardware level.

Ok, so lets theoretically build ourselves 10 Titans (about 1-2 billion dollarydoos), throw away 90% of the complexity of the brain, and use those 10 titans to implement an artificial general intelligence.  One of the worries people have are how that general intelligence could change itself or interpret its directives in a monkey-paw-esque manner and go about exterminating humanity.  Lets not even go that far, lets just go as far as saying it ""works against our intentions"" such that it violates the directives we wanted it to have.

We know that any such general intelligence would have to be able to adjust itself - basically by adjusting its classification models and decision making.  In building an ML model, one does not necessarily need to worry about the halting problem - that's not an issue, because you're not doing general computation, you're usually just doing a classification problem and then using some sort of decision matrix (or however you want to call the decision making portion of the model) to interpret the results.  Where you **will** run into the halting problem is when you allow a machine to modify its own decision making system.  Now the machine also needs to contend with the possibility that any such adjustment to its decision model could produce logic that will lead to... to put it simply... a non-halting computation that prevents it from progressing further (it's more complicated than that, but i'm using the simplest form of an error to just demonstrate my point).

In biology, we got past this issue by... well... producing a few billion humans over the course of millennia. We don't so much contend with the halting problem in ours brains so much as we just found a classification model and decision system that works ""well enough"".  We also had the luxury of concurrent computations - i.e. thousands or millions of Titans*10's all trying to make a working model all at once.

So now we're not talking about a single general intelligence, we're talking about many general intelligences all chunking away for a very, very long time to find a working model **just to prevent the catastrophic failure of the AGI**, let alone for it to accomplish... anything?

And that's where I get back to - people who are fearful of some kind of malevolent general intelligence.  Our ML and AI systems **today and for the foreseeable future** are not **general intelligence**, they are tailored intelligence - drive this car, identify gay people on a dating website, identify potential indicators of someone becoming a mass shooter.  All of these have **built-in intents**, and therefore the problems we're going to contend with for the foreseeable future isn't the possibility of a general intelligence suddenly gaining mass control, it's either 1) poorly built models whose actual intent does not match the intent of the creator or 2) the misuse of tailored intelligence by unethical humans to build oppressive societies (one can imagine Russia using the Gaydar AI to exterminate whoever it classifies as gay).  

Which is why I repeatedly say - if you look at this problem just from the basis physical limitations of computation (literally in terms of transistors, FLOPS, and the halting problem), discussing the ""Malevolent AGI"" problem is just conjecturing about science fiction - it's simply not going to happen like that.  The problems we're going to need to worry about in the next 100 years are basically just how malevolent humans utilize highly accurate classifiers to destroy any semblance of privacy or create oppressive systems.",1566064885,{},ex7u8nv,False,t3_cr53yg,False,True,t1_ex4285j,/r/todayilearned/comments/cr53yg/til_stanford_university_developed_artificial/ex7u8nv/,1566064898.0,1,True,,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],Newslyst,,,[],,,,text,t2_17a81x,False,,"So, I've read Bostrom's book and I'm by no means in the LessWrong camp, but the tone and content of your post make me feel like a reply is warranted. Generally, I think you come off a bit harsh on people who ""dont know what they're talking about,"" but then you sort of framed your comment in a way that doesnt seem to belie much understanding yourself.

1. Transistors is a weird way to measure compute power rather than, say, FLOPS, if you're trying to estimate the theoretical CPU load of whole brain emulation.  Maybe you were trying to speak more generally(i.e. CPU/RAM/disk)? But then again, ""transistor"" is a clumsy term to use if you're talking about memory cells, plus you mentioned an AMD chip and failed to mention RAM or disk, for which brain matter is also presumably responsible, so, yeah...  

2. ""Software"" is not a great term when it comes to brains. In any case, it isn't something ""extra"" to load into your model. Once you've emulated the whole brain, you've got the ""software"" in the hardware - HumanOS comes preinstalled.

3. Curious about where you got your numbers? Not to say that the ""1000 transistors"" number is low, but I'm just curious where you got it. There is considerable debate about the computational complexity of a neuron and the level of detail required to accurately model human cognition at a neuronal level. 

4a. There are probably(to use the term lightly) some enormous efficiency gains to be made in terms of throwing out unnecessary computation that pertains to regulating hormones, cardiopulmonary function, etc. *whole* brain emulation is gratuitous.

4b. For what we do want to keep, there are also probably huge gains to be had in terms of computational efficiency(data compression, better search algos, etc). I don't want to bash darwinian evolution, after all did it make us. But it also happened to put our optic nerve in front of our retina.  We undoubtedly use way more FLOPS to perform matrix multiplication in our heads than your GPU does. And if HumanOS is 1 billion lines of C(probably way underestimated, just a sake of argument number), you could almost certainly refactor it down at least a couple orders of magnitude and in the process massively improve runtime efficiency. Not to mention I/O. Cross talk between neurons is nowhere near the speed with which data moves across the internet, let alone the southbridge in your PC.

6. Artificial Human intelligence isn't really the goal for most AGI researchers. ML research is not AGI research, far from it. It is a lone and rare AGI researcher who looks to ML and thinks that all that stands in the way of AGI is a mere tweaking and scaling up of the techniques we use today to build expert systems. Most of the interest around neuroscience in the ML field comes from a consensus that *something* clever is going on the in the brain, and if we can figure out the class of algorithms that is doing that, big breakthroughs might come. Again, *whole* brain emulation is gratuitous, what we are after is just the bare minimum basket of tricks that affords us such a strong optimization power across such a wide set of problem domains. WBE is a solid theoretical proof of concept that it can be done, but it's not a likely candidate for the first successfully deployed AGI design.

7. The prediction that AGI is really far away is something hotly debated among the field, and nobody really knows for sure. The high rate of uncertainty within the field should give folks reason to be cautious and not make such a confident claim that it's ""far far far far away"".  In any case, given the magnitude of the risk and the applicability to other problem domains, investing more into decision theory and the control problem in general is probably a prudent thing to do.

[],_fuck_me_sideways_,,,[],,,,text,t2_menwb,False,,"Before you get into the Theory of Evolution, you should know what a theory is in the first place. Most people throw around the word as if it's no more than a hunch. But in Science, a theory takes observations of the world around us, forms a hypothesis (a proposal of what's going on based on the observations), and tests it with various experiments and further observation on the results, repeated and adjusted many times to gain degrees of certainty. Theories have a mechanism (how it works) and conclusive data to back it up. This isn't the end though, people may take a Theory and apply mathematics in some cases to form a Law. Gravity is the most common example there.
---


Now that we have an introduction of theory, we can continue to lay the groundwork for Evolution. To start at the very beginning (after the big bang and the formation of our solar system) there are certain elements that we call the building blocks of life, these elements may have come together in a crazy lucky chemical reaction that brought LUCA (our Last Universal Common Ancestor, among other organisms that died off early) into existence. If you want to see how the chemical reaction works, there's a neat youtube video called ""The Molecular Shape of You"" by Acapella Science (a scholar who presents high level topics in easier to understand song lyrics.)
---


From there, LUCA continued reacting to its environment and changing its cellular structure over long periods of time until it developed random traits that diverged into cells that photosynthesize, or into cells that consume (phages.) Then it became a game of cat and mouse, random mutation allowed receptors to detect the chemical presence of a foreign entity and swim away with its flagella. The thing is, humans are very incapable of truly comprehending how long 100 million years is, let alone the entire history of these little mutations going on and on until cells started working together, combining functions until we have an organism that resembles classical life such as fish.
---


Even then, cellular structure didn't stop randomly mutating as it reacted with the environment. Enter the Devonian era, a time period in which fish formed leg structures and became amphibious as they reap the rewards of a lush land ripe with sources of food while returning to the Devonian sea to lay eggs. Eventually, mutations caused amphibians to be entirely land based, but later it is thought that some may have regressed and dedicated themselves to the ocean (why whales have hip bones.) On and on over the march of time creatures diversify their traits entirely randomly. Some dying, some getting by, and some improving.

[],Beoftw,,,[],,,,text,t2_pd58j,False,,"&gt;It's very possible that a certain mutation sometimes causes homosexuality and sometimes causes these physical features.  This is a pretty common thing in genetics, and would account for a higher appearance of these traits in homosexuals.

I suppose that makes sense. You have a point.  


&gt;For instance, imagine someone having a disease that has certain common symptoms. Maybe 2 of the many symptoms are headache and a rash.  
&gt;  
&gt;First of all, not all people are going to exhibit the same symptoms. Does that mean that the disease doesn't cause these symptoms? Of course not, it does cause them, just not in everyone.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second of all, does the appearance of these symptoms mean that rash causes headache or that headache causes rash? **Of course not, it could also mean that there is something unidentified that causes both.**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, I think I understand what you are saying. It makes sense, sure. But those symptoms can also be present in a number of different diseases, just as these traits can also be attributed to a number of different genetic mutations. This article claims that those superficial features are a ""sure"" sign of being gay, rather than as you say, a genetic effect where one of the symptoms may be homosexuality. I think that is still making a big assumption. What this article should be saying is that this detects a probability, not an out right conclusive answer. That when assessing all these points of data, combined, it can lead us to believe there is a high statistical chance of the person being a homosexual. But that doesn't technically imply that these physical traits are a byproduct of homosexuality, just that there is a correlation.

[],Bakoro,,,[],,,,text,t2_7fz62,False,[],"As I see it, Instructional software is the *only* practical way forward we currently have available to educate the world's population.  
There are *not* enough spaces in colleges and universities to meet the demand of all the people who want to go. K-12 classes are often over-packed. 
In k-12, it's just not possible for even the best teacher to give every student the individual attention they may need to excel, when there's 30+ kids in a classroom. They can barely do it in a 20 person classroom. We're left with a system where we're losing a lot of potential talent because some kid's educational needs weren't identified and met early on.   
   
We've got a growing base of knowledge that people need, and we need better, more efficient means of getting it to people. We need a flexible education system that allows students to play to their strengths and not hold them back in those areas.  
      
And frankly, the quality of a lot of education is dubious. I don't want to shit on teachers in general (I've got two sisters who are teachers), because the job is hard enough. At the same time, if my personal experience of going through k-12 and now months away from graduating with a degree in computer engineering at a UC means anything: there is a very large minority of teachers who completely suck at teaching. It's maybe one in five or six teachers I've had that were just awful. I've had some teachers where I think they might even have been detrimental to their students. A majority of teachers I've had are merely adequate.   
Granting that the humanities are a little different, where the classroom experience and a live instructor are an essential part of the learning, as far as math and science go, there's no reason to have wildly differing curriculum and standards across different classrooms in the same school, let alone across the nation. Everyone who went through school though, knew that one math teacher who was known for being a softy, while the other teacher would break your balls. Fuck that, put it into software.    
   
What we *should* be doing is finding the best lecturers, and make several versions of very high quality, exhaustive video lectures on everything. Stop making teachers lecture the same shit over and over again, let them use that time to actually teach people. The person watches the video, and they can go to the teacher to explain the things they're struggling with.   
If a person can chug on through from algebra through college calculus before they're done with high school, let them have at it. All that shit can be automated, and at this point a ton of colleges are already offloading lower division math to academic software *anyway*. Most of a STEM degree and probably others could be automated up to like a Master's level, except for the hands-on lab stuff. You'd still need people to read and grade written work, but so much of the educational system could be converted to better use the human resources we have, and make better educational outcomes for everyone.

edit: Also, just to get ahead of the inevitable complaints: yes I've experienced awful software, where I put ""3.12 "", but the answer expected was ""3.12"" and I got marked wrong.

If computers aren't your thing, think about video game systems.

Original NES was an 8bit system.  That means the bones and brains of the NES itself was capable of processing 8 bits of data (e.g. 01001011) per each clock cycle of it's processor.  Of course to make things to faster one can increase the clock speed of a processor, but at some point you run into heat problems going too fast, so instead, technology advanced to simply run double the ""stuff"" at once, hence the birth of 16 bit architecture.  This meant with the same speed of processor you could DOUBLE the amount of data you could process at once, effectively speeding up the processor's computing power.  

Of course in order to leverage this new hardware technology, files needed to take advantage of this, and thus were coded differently to break up their pieces into larger individual chunks.  A 64 bit system using 32 bit files can't just take two chunks at once cause it has the room for it, it still only handles one chunk at a time.

Tobacco cultivation currently uses enough pesticide to rank amongst the top 10 cultivation pesticide usages in the US. 
 
The rest of the top 10 is rounded out by commonly exported and subsidized food items like soy and maize. 

The same restrictions which govern which pesticides can be used on food, and state what the maximum amount of these pesticides is allowed to remain on food after harvesting are virtually the same for tobacco. So while they’re using a lot of pesticides on tobacco plants, they’re using the same pesticides on food, and they have strict guidelines which are supposed to prevent harmful amounts of pesticides from remaining on both food and tobacco post harvesting. Now these pesticides have historically been more highly regulated at times than others because the agency governing these regulations doesn’t have true legal authority over anything really. How much the fda has been allowed to actually enforce these laws and how much mass tobacco producers have cared to follow them has waxed and waned over the decades. Regardless, there is actually a substantial amount of evidence which proves that tobacco plants are much more highly regulated in terms of what goes on them than most people realize. Two big misconceptions about tobacco are: 1) organic forms are better 2) marijuana cultivation uses fewer pesticides and have less of them . 

Both are completely false as organic pesticides as a whole are not any more or less dangerous than their synthetic counterparts, except they require much greater usage rates to be effective and thus organic tobacco cultivation retains higher trace amounts of organic pesticides on their crop. 

Marijuana cultivation, on the other hand, is a mess, and federal legislation is sorely needed to enforce stricter pesticides and additive restrictions. There are countless numbers of arbitrary pesticides methods used by cultivators across the country and virtually no set standard. 

The largest advantage marijuana holds over tobacco is that a large portion of tobacco‘s Nasty ‘chemicals’ get formed during the curing process and most of these are the result of photodecomosition of parts if the plant that are intrinsic to tobacco. 

Most of these procarcinogens are not found intrinsically in marijuana plants. There is plenty of empirical evidence which proves combusted marijuana plant matter, when trace amounts pesticide are not present prior to curing, produces only a fraction of the total numbers of carcinogens as combusted tobacco plants. 

For whatever reason, combusting tobacco plant matter just produces a ton more of harmful products independent of the method of cultivation and curing. These are not possible to remove unless you remove the plant matter, which is essentially what vaping does. Primary data suggests these type of vaporizing certain tobacco products poses a significantly lower risk to human health than smoking cured tobacco does. .",1569340579,{},f1bqcjd,False,t3_d8nvrz,False,True,t3_d8nvrz,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/d8nvrz/eli5_why_cant_cigarettes_just_have_straight/f1bqcjd/,1569340581.0,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You might have several network jacks per office, which means it's easy to have hundreds of ethernet cables coming into these comm closets.  

But you want the flexibility to plug them to suit your needs.  So you have the jacks in the offices wired into a patch panel with rows upon rows of female jacks, labeled with where the other end is (office 101 port A, or whatever).  

When you see the ""clean"" pictures, it's almost always the *back* of these patch panels.  Those cables don't move at all after they're installed, so they generally are installed in big bundles and nice and tidy.

[],mredding,,,[],,,,text,t2_3y1ul,False,,"These cable standards define a lot regarding to the nature of the signals they carry, including minimum performance and tolerances.

Audio and video cables typically carry a single-ended signal, where the signal amplitude is relative to a reference voltage, usually ground. The problem is ground for the sender may be different than ground for the receiver. Audio and video signals tend to tolerate this sort of thing - you won't notice the noise in the data. They also can't reject noise because there's no telling.

This sort of thing is inadequate for data, where a single bit being wrong means the whole payload may be unusable. Enter ""differential signaling"". This is where you send the same signal 180 degrees out of phase, so you're sending a signal and it's exact opposite down two wires. The data is encoded not in the signal itself, but the difference between the two signals. The advantage is that noise will effect both signals equally, so the relative difference between both signals remains the same.

The wires in the cable are either active or passive, where they carry a signal, or they're literally antennas. The passive wires are used to pick up noise, which can then be subtracted from the active wires. If the wire is bidirectional, like Ethernet cable, some wires are for sending, some are for receiving. Some wires, like in USB are to provide power to the device. Some wires, like in an HDMI cable, carry data per color channel. The wires are also twisted around each other in particular ways to ensure they minimize noise emitted and received. They may even cancel out their own noise generated. And the wires can be wrapped in a shield that's grounded, protecting it from noise.

The plug may be significant. You see this especially in proprietary connectors in certain industries, in particular industrial machines and their controllers - some prongs may be different lengths to ensure certain wires connect in a particular order. Typically you want ground, common, and shielding to come into contact first, so any capacitance won't accidentally discharge and damage the system.

The cable standards themselves dictate the kind of signal modulation carried on the wire, timing, meaning, etc. This is a big subject all by itself that is on top of just the cable.

It used to be cables were very parallel, lots of wires. Were you around for the old printer cables of the 80s and 90s? Huge. 40 wires or more. Ribbon cables inside the computer were the same. 60 wires or more. SCSI cables, were insane, and could be several feet long, inside the machine (usually a server). But the problem with parallel cables is that you have to synchronize all the signal wires. If you're going to send 32 bits at once, they all have to arrive at the destination at the same time, within tolerance. The more parallel you get, and the faster you get, the harder that becomes. We eventually hit a economic wall, where faster was the way to go - you could send more data by sending it faster, and it's a lot easier to send data fast down a serial single or differential signal.

A) the patient dies, or my new drug kills them. So either it didn’t work OR my drug was so nasty it caused side effects. A drug that cures cancer and destroys my brain isn’t very useful because I have no cancer but now my brain doesn’t work. 
B) The drug works, at least partially, and the side effects are manageable. The reward of the drug is greater than the risk. 

If the drug worked, now we get to try it on more people. More people want to get the drug because it has a chance to kill the cancer, but again mostly people who are running out of alternative options. Now we study those side effects a little more closely.

Well let me tell you, the body doesn’t like drugs. If I have 50 ways to kill a cancer cell, there are 5000 ways to hurt a different cell. Cancer is strong, the rest of your cells are weak. 

Let me give you an analogy. A tank is riding around in new york city, but no one really notices until it starts destroying cars and police show up and now theres lots of traffic and everyone is pissed. 
1) Well I could shoot the tank with guns. Police officers have pistols, but they aren’t very good at at aiming so now some people walking down the side walk get killed. That option isn’t a very good one, but it was an option. This is a drug that failed to kill the cancer, and it also had bad side effects. 
2) We could send a missile and blow it up, but the missile makes a big explosion, but a bunch of police fighting the tank die and a bunch of people watching from their apartment get killed. That is actually a better option. A lot of people die, but at least we destroyed the tank. This is kind of how some of the older chemo works. We destroy the cancer, but a lot of immune cells (the bodies police) get killed and other cells that are just minding their own business get killed too. 
3) We bring in some special agents, some SWAT teams. One guy destroys the tracks on the tank, so now it cant move. A second guy jumps on top of the tank and pulls the door open. A third guy climbs in the tank and handcuffs the driver. This is similar to some of the newer drugs on the market. Alone, they can help but they need help. A guy that handcuffs the driver can’t open the hatch because he is holding the handcuffs, so someone has to open the hatch for him, or he can do his job faster if someone opens the hatch and he can just jump in. Drug cocktails work this way, several drugs doing one job, but together they kill the cancer and prevent it from spreading. 

So what is the issue? The issue is most of the new discoveries are in mouse models, or small cancer batches. The new drug is a cop with a pistol, who just happens to shoot the driver through a tiny window in the tank. Well when we use that same drug in a human, that cop now has to make that shot with people around and its no longer a good option. Or it has to operate in different populations, different cities, different scenarios. Every person is different, its difficult to train every cop to be an expert.

What the speed your internet provider tells you is just how big the pipe coming into your home is and the speed of the internet your computer reports is how big the pipe coming into it is.

[],Naturage,,,[],,,,text,t2_ov1hq,False,,"Oh my, you're asking for a whole stats course in one post. Let's see if I can help.

Suppose you have a dataset with some predictors X and a result variable Y. You wish to try amd predict Y. The simplest prediction is ""Y is about average"" and you just claim that whenever you see a record, Y on it will be the average of observed values. Of course, that's a bad estimate; you're usually far off. The error is usually taken as (true value - predicted value)^2 . In this case, it's pretty big.

So you emply regression. At it's heart, linear regresion is a method to create a best possible model of the form Y = A + B_1 \* X_1 + B_2 \* X_2 + ... + B_n \* X_n; in other words, finding what linear combination of X's gets closest to estimating Y. This does better; once you go through the steps your new predicted model gets lower errors. Here's where R^2 comes in. Recall that terrible model at the start of everything being the mean? We take that as the base, calculate the same for regression, and compare the two. R^2 of 0 means they're equal; R^2 of 0.8 - that new error is 80% smaller, etc. *R^2 is the proportion of error that your model managed to fix.*

Next up, p-values. Recall how the model was made? We had these B coefficients flying around. Often you don't care about how good your prediction is; you care about whether a certain X should be a part of regression. To that end, we want to tell ""how likely a B this high is a fluke"", and p-value is the answer. There is a thing called t-test which takes info from the model and spits out a single value T for each B. We know that if X was a bogus predictor, T would follow a specific distribution. By putting our observed T there, we can tell how unusual our value is (imagine you flipped a coin 10 tkmes and got 9 heads; you've got a strong case to think the coin is rigged and not just flipped that way by chance). *P-value is a measure of ""if X were random noise, how likely am I to get this, or more extreme (away from 0), B for it?"" Most sciences take p of 0.05 as threshold for significance; in other words, if all you gave them was bogus random data, they'd be happy to report a significant finding 5% of the time.

Finally, binary variables. That's a slightly different topic, and depending on what you mean might be either trivial or way beyond what I can eli5. Do you have an X with a list of results you want to turn into binary? If so, just make a bunch of new ones saying ""is X = [a value]? 1=yes, 0=no"".

[],CatpainTpyos,,,[],,,,text,t2_11a1lo,False,,"**TL;DR:** Compression algorithms typically find patterns in the binary data and shorten the file that way, and they also have other ways of eliminating information that the user probably won't notice is missing anyway.

One very common method of file compression employs a bit of ""pattern recognition."" Suppose you had the following (essentially nonsensical) message:

* Apple Banana Carrot Apple Banana Carrot Apple Banana Carrot Banana Banana Banana Banana Apple Banana Carrot Apple Banana Carrot Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Apple Banana

If you wanted to shorten this message, you could look for repeated bits and replace them by something shorter, and include an explanation of what the shortened strings stand for, so the recipient can ""undo"" the compression. I see the substring ""Apple Banana Carrot"" appears a lot, so I'll replace that by ABC:

* ABC ABC ABC Banana Banana Banana Banana ABC ABC Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Carrot Apple Apple Banana

""Carrot Apple"" appears a lot too, so I'll replace that with ""CA"":

* ABC ABC ABC Banana Banana Banana Banana ABC ABC CA CA CA CA Apple Banana

Then I can further shorten it by grouping together repeated bits:

* (ABC)x3 (Banana)x4 (ABC)x2 (CA)x4 Apple Banana

By doing these replacements, I've shortened the message a great deal. Even after I include the information to allow a computer to back-substitute, this would still result in a shorter message than what I started with.

More broadly, every computer file, regardless of type is actually stored on your hard drive as a binary bitstring - a long series of 1s and 0s. If the compression algorithm can find particular strings that appear a lot, it can make substitutions like what I did above, potentially saving a lot of file space.
Now, obviously the exact methods of compression vary from algorithm to algorithm, but this serves as a general example of the types of methods they might use.

Thinking about this type of substitution-based algorithm, it should be clear that larger files take longer to compress simply because they have more ""stuff"" for the computer to look over to even find the patterns in the first place, and then they have more ""stuff"" to replace too.

There's also another type of compression that some image formats use. The most straightforward way to store a picture is to simply store it as an n-by-m map of pixels and record each pixel's color. This is what's known as a bitmap and you might be familiar with this type of file (.BMP) as that's what MS-Paint defaults to. Because this format records exact color information of *every* pixel, there's absolutely zero loss of information when saving the file, but the trade-off is the file sizes can get big fast. I believe BMP files don't even use any pattern-based compression either, further bloating their file size.

To counteract this, a group of programmers working at Compuserve in 1987 invented the Graphics Interchange Format (.GIF). Most famously GIFs allow for animated images, although that wasn't true initially. At the start, it was simply a way to compress images to make them easier to store on computers' very limited hard drive space or to send to other people.

In addition to employing the pattern-based compression detailed above, the Compuserve team improved upon the bitmap by reducing the number of colors available to use. Bitmaps stored the exact color information of every pixel as a triplet of numbers describing how much red, how much green, and how much blue comprised the color. This allowed for a grand total of 256^(3) or over 16 million unique colors. But the Compuserve team noticed that most of these colors weren't really needed because end users couldn't tell the difference between a light purple (187, 0, 187) and a *slightly* lighter purple (189, 0, 189). The Compuserve team limited GIFs to a palette of 256 available colors (though each separate file has its own set of 256 colors), which allowed for much smaller file sizes while still limiting the information loss to what they felt was an acceptable amount.

Subsequent work on the GIF format introduced the ability to have animation. This was achieved in a really clever way. Rather than naively storing the image information for each frame of the animation, which would quickly get costly in terms of storage space, developers decided to instead look at the differences between frames. If, for instance, the image was of a winking smiley face, most of the face stays the same across frames, and only the one eye and the area immediately surrounding it changes. Essentially, an animated GIF stores the initial image and then a list of directions of how to change the image from frame to frame.

Many other compression algorithms exist for other types of files, but I'm not familiar enough with how they work to get into detail.

So, here are some screenshots of tools ""wifi hackers"" use. 

From a blog post by Julia Evans. https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/06/19/what-i-use-wireshark-for/

Here is a screenshot of a packet capture. 

https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_screenshot.png

Very busy. 

The most important part, surprisingly, is the ""Apply a display filter.""

Wireshark is a tool that you run on your computer. You click a button and it ""records"" network traffic (say, on wifi). Everyone's network traffic (if you have it configured right and the people configure their wifi network stupid). You do this for, like, an hour, and then sit down and analyze the packets you have captured. 

Packets are data exchanged between your computer and the internet. 

When you want to see a picture of a dog, you send a request to google. That request is ""I want to see pictures of dogs."" 

In order to tell the internet this, your computer breaks up the message into equal parts:

1. I wan

2. t To s

3. ee P

4. ictur

5. es of

6. dog

7. s.\0

Those are packets. Sometimes, they really do look just like that, a simple message that a human can read. These are called human readable, plaintext, raw strings, etc. Often you will here security professionals say things like ""those idiots were storing passwords plaintext."" That means the message was unencrypted, so instead of looking like this:

* jaasdfas8fa8sf9ya98h29f283hjf23fj

It looked like this:

* username:bobpassword:hunter2

SO back to the packet capture screen:

The light blueish middle part are PACKETS, which wireshark is smart enough to lump together into requests when it can (the entire ""I want to see pictures of dogs"" message). You can see various information about the packet, like when it happened, what protocol it used, how big it is, and then misc information. You can use this view to determine what in front of you might be interesting, combined with filters. Maybe you want to try to read people's emails, so you switch ""protocol"" to the email protocol SMTP. Or you want to hack into someone's email yourself, by getting their username and password, so you look for requests against the gmail website, under the protocol HTTP (actually HTTPS but whatever). You have to filter very well to find the most useful information because you've captured tens of thousands of packets, most of which is encrypted, or useless spammy bullshit. A good hacker is a good filter writer. 

Where the GOOD SHIT IS: The pink box below. See those random &lt;.... n ...&gt; .EE things? Those are the packets translated straight into text. It's encrypted, so it looks meaningless.

A clever system was created that can encode data into a seemingly random, visual thing - and also be able to look at that thing and translate it back (decode).

The actual size of the QR code and how many of those little squares you can fit into it determines how much information you can store. Usually the 'standard' size ones you see are big enough to hold some text.

Special software uses a camera to see the QR code picture and it looks for a few special things to identify it. If you look at a bunch of different QR codes, you might notice some similarities, usually three prominent squares placed very close to the corners. This helps the software align the code for reading.

It then looks at the pattern of smaller squares inside the code and translates the image back into whatever it was - usually text (but picture and even audio QR codes exist).

Normally, the result is a web link that takes you to the relevant content you scanned.

Some components have a more direct impact on performance, some components can give a bigger benefit with a smaller cost or are easier to replace, but ultimately they all play a part.

The CPU is the brains of the machine, everything your computer does requires the CPU to perform one or more operations. In some cases those operations are passed off to more specialised processors (graphics -&gt; GPU, audio -&gt; APU, networking -&gt; NPU/NIC) but they're still going via the CPU. A faster CPU can do sequential operations faster. A CPU with more cores can do more operations in parallel. CPU's have a tiny amount of super-fast working memory, but a lot of the time they're working with system RAM.

The system memory/RAM is temporary storage space for the CPU. Every application you run is stored in RAM. Faster RAM means the data in RAM can be read from or written to faster. When RAM is full your computer has to use your much slower hard drive to store some of the working memory. So more RAM can improve performance if you're running big applications or multiple apps at once.

Hard drive is where you store data you want to keep. Your Windows installation, your installed applications, your documents etc. When you run an app or load a file, the computer can only read it as fast as the drive can retrieve that data. Hard drives are either HDD or SSD, without going into technical details SSDs can give a huge performance increase but cost more for a smaller amount of storage.

Graphics card/GPU is what outputs the image to your monitor, most motherboards/CPUs have cheap graphics processing on-board so no need to buy a separate graphics card if you don't do gaming.

Sound card/APU is like the GPU for audio, but again it will be included with your motherboard (also your graphics card if you have one).

Network interface/NIC/NPU handles your networking processing and provides the network connection (CAT-5/Ethernet or Wi-Fi), yet again this is relatively simple processing that comes included on any modern motherboard (Ethernet definitely, Wi-Fi sometimes).

Speaking of, the Motherboard probably has the least direct impact on performance. It's the big circuit board upon which everything else sits or connects to. It also provides the conduit for the components to communicate with each other. As long as the motherboard fully supports the other components you have, it otherwise shouldn't impact performance.

The PSU is the PC's power supply, again as long as it supports the power required by all the components without choking, it's not impacting performance.

As far as Internet speed, your computer's general performance (combination of NIC, CPU, memory, hard drive) affects how quickly you can send or receive network data, but not a whole lot. The biggest factor under your direct control is your modem, router and/or switch (some devices combine these functions). The biggest factor overall is the speed your ISP provides, mostly that's based on the speed you've paid for, and their connection pathway to the web service you're connecting to. It's also impacted by congestion, ie. how many other people around you are also using the Internet.

Another major factor is the performance of the server your computer is communicating with (which is impacted by the individual hardware components of that machine same as yours is). Technically the quality of the connection between your modem and ISP is also a factor (the wiring in your house, your street, your local exchange box and so on) may also be a factor, but really only if something is degraded or broken.",1568268620,{},ezyibun,False,t3_d30clg,False,True,t3_d30clg,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/d30clg/eli5_what_actually_matters_in_computers_and/ezyibun/,1568268632.0,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can think of it as a bunch of towns that had their own road systems but there was no interstate system to connect all the towns to each other. You can put a bunch of computers together in a room and create a Local Area Network and that's what a LAN party is.

Time went on and everyone wanted their networks connected to each other, so they set off to build that. We didn't have the physical infrastructure to connect all the computers with Ethernet cables, but we did have telephone lines. So we figured out a way to use the telephone lines to let all these different ""interconnected networks"" (internet) talk to each other. This is why companies like AT&amp;T are big players in the internet. Later on we figured out how to use cable lines (as in cable TV). Then companies like AT&amp;T started investing in massive projects to bury miles and miles of fiber optic cables to connect each other.

There are cables at the bottom of the oceans that literally connect the continents with thousands of miles of cabling.

We can also use radio waves to do stuff like Wi-fi and cellular.

So eventually all of these computers are now connected to each other. My computer and your computer are literally, physically connected to each other right now (well unless you're on wifi). If we made the effort, we could trace each inch of telephone wire, cable wire and fiber optics between our two computers.

And that's basically it. We connected all of the computers to each other so that they can send data back and forth.

There are organizations and governments that help organize this stuff. Most internet traffic runs through major hubs in big cities. I'm in Orlando right now, and maybe you're in California. My internet traffic is going to go to Atlanta first before being routed out west if it's trying to get to you. The major hubs are pretty much where you would expect them to be. Major cities, same places with big airports.

Card counting is not illegal (only frowned upon). In some states (NJ?) it is illegal to ban a card counter so they resort to other tactics to remove the edge. This is usually capping the max bet on the table so that you are unable to bet large when the count is in your favor. Essentially this makes it impossible to gain an edge. Autoshufflers also make it impossible to beat in the long run too.

The way card counting works is by using a simple addition/subtraction system to identify when the deck has an imbalance in the composition of particular cards of the deck. These are card removal effects.

When you have identify more Tens/Aces relative to the lower cards in the deck then your play can shift from basic strategy (like the charts you can find online) to a strategy with more double-downs (since you are likely to get more Tens/Aces) and less hitting when you have hands like hard 12/13 (more likely to bust because higher composition of Tens).

The main edge (both strategy and bet size are important to get right because the edge is rather thin) when card counting comes from the bet spread you use. This is also how casinos identify card counters. When you have a low count (casino has higher edge) then you should be betting minimum to reduce losses. When the count shifts to a high count (players favor) you should be betting large to profit from the edge. Generally 12x the minimum bet is the minimum spread a counter should have. This all depends on several factors including; profitability you wish to seek, system being used, etc. When you bet large after min-betting for half an hour and the deck runs out Tens and Aces it is pretty obvious you are counting.

Gennerally insurance is a sucker bet and losing at a pretty good clip but when you are counting it can become profitable to take insurance. Also, when the player gets blackjack they get paid 3:2 while the house gets 1:1 when they get blackjack (you just lose your bet) so some of your edge comes from these 2 things.

Cover plays are used to get the ""heat"" off you. If the floor manager is scoping you out you start shooting big bets on low counts to make them think you are just a gambler. But you can never avoid the eye in the sky who will identify your bullshit pretty easy. 

The reason card counters sometimes work in teams is to have spotters (counters) min-betting multiple tables while signaling to a shooter (the guy acting like a big gambler who is walking around from table to table) when the count is high.

A simple less than 100 bytes request can give many kB of data! is is like 40 to 100 times bigger and sometime more! This is the equivalent of asking sears to send out the catalog. Small initial packet, big result. If you have a simple 1Mbit upload, this can easilly become 40 to 100Mbit attack.

For this attack, it is very hard to mitigate it, if not impossible. There was hundred of thousands of known server that had that vulnerability at the peak of this. Now there ""should"" be none left as it has been patched a few years ago by every active vendors. The attacker was taking the big list, and was simply asking each of those servers one by one. Each server was getting one request, but the victim received thousands of ""catalog"" all from different server.

The problem with those kind of attack is that you can't block it locally. You have to ask your internet provider to block it before it get on your connection. Same as with normal mail, if it fill up your mailbox faster than you can empty it, you will miss important things, but if you ask the post office to discard all the catalogs before they send it to you then you are fine. But... not all provider will do it, and even if they do, they may be the one that can't handle all that data.

For example, one provider could have only 100Gbit of download capability. With that attack, you need like 5Gbit of attack upload speed to saturate the whole provider ! Most provider will rely on some local cache/servers. For example, google have some dataserver directly connected to most big providers in many of the big city. Same with youtube and netflix. Also, cloudflare, which provide caching, also have servers in most providers. What those do? Instead of having to transfert the data across the world, it never leave your provider, thru it never use their bandwidth to the outside world ! This also mean that you can use a relativelly weak connection to the world while being able to provide extremelly fast content to your clients. Why go to australia when there is a local cache? It is about 250ms to go to australia and back... Or about 2ms locally !",1568003930,{},eznchm6,False,t3_d1fd3a,False,True,t1_ezl7t5e,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/d1fd3a/eli5_how_can_someone_ddos_servers_of_multibillion/eznchm6/,1568003941.0,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],mredding,,,[],,,,text,t2_3y1ul,False,,"Every electrical conductor, of any length or size, is also a radio transmitter. All the wiring of the power lines, in your walls, in your toaster. Even florescent lights give off RF radiation. So does a flashlight, when turned on. The entire planet is completely and entirely awash in EM and RF radiation, your mother, everyone, everything. Then we have our noisy neighbor, the sun, that releases all sorts of radiation, a fair amount of it that passes right through the whole entire planet like we're not even here.

The point I'm making is not to frighten or shock, but to highlight the magnitude of your mother's ignorance. She has no idea what she's talking about, she's so wrapped up in worrying about WiFi of all fucking things that she hasn't even bothered or is incapable of conceiving the sheer magnitude of it all.

Such fears and concerns are vastly overstated, there are far deadlier and more dangerous things we are exposed to - thing we ACTUALLY KNOW FOR A FACT ARE CARCINOGENS, that the very dubious question of whether WiFi can cause cancer or not is not of any real concern.

I'll illustrate.

If you live in the US, all American grown tobacco is 100% nuclear fucking radioactive. Back in the 50s, lobbyists got a law passed allowing tobacco farmers to use apatite, a phosphorous rich mineral, as a fertilizer. The problem with this stuff is it's porous, and over millions of years, sucked up every radioactive isotope that mineral has ever seen. It's not the mineral itself that's radioactive, but it's all the trace elements it's picked up. How radioactive is it? Well, the US is seeing all-time lows in smoking, but all-time highs in death from tobacco related products, including 2nd hand and 3rd hand smoking. And it's not because we're tracking the data differently. Smoking in the 50s, before the use of this mineral, was not this dangerous. A pack a day smoker is subjecting themselves to ~2,000 chest X-rays a year (the recommended safe exposure limit is 4 per year), and the smoke they exhale is also radioactive, so just BEING IN THE SAME SPACE as where smokers have smoked, even if you can't smell old smoke, you're exposed to higher than background. All that smoke doesn't just ""blow away"", it settles, all around everywhere a smoker smokes, in their car, in their house. And cancer risk is accumulative, which is why 3rd hand - contact exposure because these people are covered in their own radioactive filth, is a big fucking deal for babies. Cigarettes set off radiation detectors in cargo ports and shipping yards, and they're handled as HAZMAT materials in bulk.

And what's worse is that since smoking is under such great decline, old tobacco fields are being repurposed for food production. It's also yet another example of what makes farm runoff so dangerous.

Now we all have an intuitive understanding of radiation and it's cancerous dangers. We know this stuff is bad news and your mother is so desensitized to this very actually real threat to her life and welfare that she thinks something we haven't been able to decide whether or not causes cancer for over 100 years, fucking RADIO, is her biggest concern right now?

And if all that about tobacco scares you, as it should, then when you hear the phrase ""chemical carcinogen"", you should be shitting your god damn pants right now. It's not just the apatite in the tobacco that makes it a carcinogen, but the act of combustion, when you burn the cigarette, by definition produces tar and other byproducts of that combustion. Many of these new chemicals are chemically active and stable. These are chemical carcinogens, and they can enter your body, and stick around for years, and they can bounce around and unzip your DNA like a pair of pants. When your DNA tries to reassemble, and if it does so with errors, you can get a cancer that holds.

And this is true of not just tobacco, but there are a number of cleaning products and otherwise seemingly mundane substances all around you, in your house, in your car, you might smell some things outside that mean you're already exposed to chemical carcinogens. And this stuff is aggressive, way more than the billiard ball shootout of decaying radioactive isotopes.

We've figured out a lot of things are carcinogens in no god damn time, we've had radio since 1899 and we still don't know?

Though many ISPs only does the bare minimum they have to by law and these ISPs will also fight for their users right to privacy.  
  
As for companies, just recently Apple and Google has stopped using humans to go through recordings (small snippets) of users voice activity (using their virtual assistants or from phonecalls) which is now done by a machine.  
Microsoft however is still using actual humans fro this process.

Companies like Google and Facebook however tracks pretty much everything you do online (they have some special cookies they use to track where you go after visiting their sites or sites that has anything from their services embedded, look up supercookie for more info).  
This info is tied to your Facebook account or your personal fingerprint (Google has developed an algorithm to track people based on their internet usage patterns), however both companies have systems available where you can get the stored data cleared.

You ""knowingly"" give your info whenever you enter personal information (email, payment info, personal preferences, etc.). Sometimes, the Terms and Conditions specify that the company is allowed to use your data however they want (including selling it to third-party companies).

Others can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure collecting personal information from users who are unaware is illegal (at least in the US and EU). However there are clever ways around this, such as starting with a banner that says ""By using our site, you are agreeing to our Terms and Conditions"". That makes using the site easier (both for companies who legitimately just want a better user experience, and for those trying to hide how they're using your data).

This data - as part of data science / ""big data"" - can be used to find trends, use statistical analysis, etc. For benign companies like Microsoft, that data will be used to determine which products are selling well, how do users interact with Microsoft products (so they know which features to focus on and improve, or are okay to drop support for), etc.

The other common, slightly less benign use, is for targeted ads. If Google knows you searched for hiking boots, then Google ads will know to show you more ads for hiking boots, but also for things like tents, Jeeps, etc. since statistically speaking, people who buy hiking boots are more likely to also buy those other things.

The malicious version (aside from identity theft from sharing payment info, for example) can be things like you sign up with randomcompany.com and give them your email address. Next thing you know, they've sold your info (to ""Personal Info Corp."" or something), someone has bought a chunk of data from Personal Info Corp. that includes your email address, and now you're getting spam emails from Nigerian princes. Or even worse, the Facebook/Russia/election interference thing in the last US presidential election.

-----

How much of what you see on the internet is tailored to you depends on the sites you go to and your definition, but generally all of it is tailored at least a little. If you count language/region as personal info, then a site you have never visited before can ""tailor"" their content to be in your region's language of choice. A new site might have Google ads which are targeted toward you. Google searches are prioritized based on magic Google algorithms including your region, other people's searches from your region, etc.

Very young children not only haven’t learn the most effective way to claim their feelings yet, but the neurons in their brain are still lacking enough myelin (the fatty protection around nerve strands that direct electric impulse) to allow emotions to fire in corresponding appropriate sections of the brain, and the resulting impulse firing floods more than the necessary parts of the brain that translate emotional data into somatic sensation and, as a result, the child’s response. Therefore, emotions in a toddler are still just noise and big feeling. Sometimes when they are more frustrated, angry, or tired, this noise in their head feels overwhelming and they seek relief, and they externalize it or seek help by impulsively shrieking. Their brain feels something intense, the feeling reaches max capacity and needs a solution, and that solution is to make a noise on the outside that reflects the current noise on the inside. The shriek does not come across to us as discernible data with which we can make a choice about what the child feels, but it serves as both temporary release of the emotional peak (like punching a pillow when you’re enraged) and an alarm to their caregivers that something is happening and needs a response such as feeding, comforting, or help regulating or determining the nature of those emotions. A big part of a parent/guardian’s job is both modeling healthy emotional control and providing concrete tools for the child to learn regulate themselves or ask for what they need, and to help them understand what is appropriate social behavior, in the form of comforting or boundary/rule reinforcement AKA punishment. Parents of a freaked out child eventually learn what types of outburst their child uses as genuine outreach or distress expression and when they are attention seeking/instigating a reaction in order to test boundaries, and you’ll see parents pull kids away to distract them from the cause if it is something trivial (like not getting a chocolate bar) or putting them in time out for misbehavior, which actually serves to give both the child and parent time to calm down and encourage the child to reflect on what they were feeling and learn to channel strong feelings in an undisruptive and socially productive way.",1567097302,{},eyi41c6,False,t3_cx100t,False,True,t1_eyhe7w8,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/cx100t/eli5_why_do_toddlers_make_that_highpitched/eyi41c6/,1567097339.0,1,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The list can be stored in a variable like other values e.g. `var myArray = [];` An empty array is like a blank piece of paper that you know you're about to write a list on.

You can put just about anything you want at any spot in the list by putting the spot number in that you want, called an index e.g. `myArray[2] = 5;` Generally, you put things in order starting at 0, so 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. Usually, you don't directly put values into an array by number. You can simply add something on to the end of the array with the .push() method like `myArray.push(10);` says to add the number 10 onto the end of the array.

Likewise, you can retrieve a value from any spot in the list `var theSecondIndexValue = myArray[2];` If you try to access a number that doesn't have a value, you'll get ""undefined"" back which is basically JavaScript saying ""I didn't find anything where you told me to look.""

Once the user is done and says to send the message, you'd then loop over the array and run code to send a message to each person one by one.

[],Miliean,,,[],,,,text,t2_3z14d,False,,"There's a few reasons.  The main one is that auto manufactures have been extremely reluctant to allow another company to take ""possession"" of the vehicles infotainment system. 

Car companies are good at making cars.  They are less good at making voice control systems.  They could outsource this processing to someone like google but the car companies don't want to lose that level of control and access to the data.  So they have been extremely resistant to doing this.

Next issue is development timelines.  Most cars take 5(ish) years to develop before they actually go on sale. At some point in this process the infotainment system becomes ""locked in"" for production.  Then the actual model of car is sold, basically unchanged, for another 5(ish) years.  Sometimes development is a lot longer, sometimes the sales period is a lot longer.  But it's not unreasonable to think that the infotainment system in a ""new"" car might have been designed 5-10 years ago, that's a LONG time when it comes to something like a voice assistant.  Go research what Google and Apple were doing in 2009 (hint, nether google assistant or Siri existed then).

There's 2 more factors.  The first is known as the data advantage.  Google, Amazon and Apple have gotten as good as they have at voice control because they have been collecting voice control based data for a long time.  The more voices that these services can hear the better they can become at learning what people are trying to say.  Car companies sell a lot of cars but it's not nearly as many as smart phones are selling, I know many people who don't have their own car but I don't know anyone without a smartphone (or who shares a smartphone).  Most 16 year olds have their own smartphone but most don't have their own car.  So there's the fact that the car companies have WAY less data available to them to collect, combined with the fact that most cars are not sending this data back home.  And this leads us to the next point.

Most smary voice systems today don't actually do the ""smart"" thing on the device itself.  A google home is just a recorder with an internet connection, not a speak renegotiation processor.  It records you, sends that snip of a recording to google's BIG server farms where google processes it and returns a result, the speaker then plays the result.  It all happens very fast and is dependent on an ""always on"" internet connection.  

Most cars don't have an internet connection like that.  So a car is doing all of the speach processing using the computer in the car.  A computer that is already somewhat old and outdated, built by a company that builds cars and not computers and it's more of a general use computer not one specifically designed for speech to text processing. So it's just disadvantage on top of disadvantage.

All of these are why things like Android auto and Apple CarPlay exist.  These services allow your smart device to control the head unit of the car.  It basically becomes just a dumb display.  But even with that innovation auto makers were still very resistant to allow it.  They don't want to give up control of the central screen in the middle of the car.  But because they really suck at this stuff they are slowly having to let go.  It's now possible (but only just barely possible) to buy a car that has it's primary infotainment system built around Android, but it's not widely available and I think it's only 1 or two models that are mostly in the design stage.",1566837904,{},ey5qefl,False,t3_cvofqx,False,True,t3_cvofqx,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/cvofqx/eli5_why_are_car_navigation_and_voice_controls_so/ey5qefl/,1566837905.0,1,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],xix_xeaon,,,[],,,,text,t2_3msk4,False,,"It's tricky because it's not completely clear IF they are economically viable.

A lot of these businesses don't make a profit. That's in large part because today, the name of the game is ""corner the market"". Basically, growing and taking over the market is more important than profit, because once you've succeed then you're the king of that world and can easily become profitable. This makes it high risk / high reward and is the reason these businesses can have so much investment and such high valuations.

Of course, from a free market perspective, this is terrible. These businesses are not ""competing in the market"" as is considered good for society as a whole, instead they're competing to gain a monopoly, which kills the market. This is not a new strategy and was banned a long time ago but apparently no one cares about enforcing those rules anymore.

The above point is true for most markets today unless they have nothing to do with technology (soon everything will be tech though). But the other point has to do especially with the so called ""Gig Economy"" which basically means that people are not employed but instead run their own business, except they don't actually run a business.

The question here about economic viability comes from the fact that regular people are terrible businessmen. Most people who work in the Gig Economy don't realize all of the cost that they have to pay themselves, such as taxes, depreciation on cars, even the cost of gas is not always considered. And then you have healthcare, saving for retirement, safety regulation, benefits of having a steady employment, and on and on.

This allows businesses to hire ""employees"" with both a lower pay than normal And for it to be completely performance based which means labor is both cheap and risk free. They also don't need to invest capital in cars, car parks, buildings (AirBnB etc), camera equipment (YouTube etc) or pretty much anything else. You might also consider social media (and even Reddit) part of the Gig Economy since it's regular people who provide all the value (data and content) but in that case the profits are not shared at all with the regular people.

The third point is Technology, which is the only point in favor of these businesses being economically viable. It's because of the internet and smartphones, as well as the whole ""big data"" sector, that it is possible to connect so many people and so many resources in real time, on demand, anywhere in the whole world, with an extremely high rate of efficiency.

[],gladfelter,,,[],,,,text,t2_d4u69,False,,"To add to this, a rarely-used data structure called a bloom filter is important for indexing at Google scale. A bloom filter is a very small piece of data that can answer the question ""do you contain X?"" for any definition of X. Your request comes into a server that has a bunch of in-memory bloom filters for all the child servers that have the needed indexing data to answer your request. The internet is simply too big for one server to have all the needed indexing data, so this index of indexes using bloom filters is needed.

Bloom filters sounds magical, and they kind of are, but they are not to hard to understand. Take any piece of information on a computer and it is made up of ""bits"", individual on-off switches. A typical Latin character such as the letter lowercase ""g"" takes 8 bits. 

There are fast, simple mathematical formulae called hash functions that can turn many bits into fewer bits. They lose information and there is a tiny chance that two unrelated pieces of information will have the same hash value, that's called a collision. A common hash function is the modulus of a very large number. It has a bounded size (no bigger than the modulus number's bit count) and it's very ""fair"" about randomly distributing the ones and zeroes across the entire resulting bit string. If a hash function ""prefers"" to put zeroes and ones in particular slots, that's bad because it will tend to result in more collisions.

If you add all the bits in a bunch of different hashes for items into one long string of bits, where 1+1=1 (this is called ""logical or"" because the out bit is one if the first OR second input bit is one) then you can hash the thing you want to search for and see if all the ones in the search item's hash are ones in the bloom filter bit string. There can be collisions, so sometimes there is an incorrect ""yes"", but when you go to the child server and find out the item isn't there you can try again or just return ""not found"".

The really amazing, unintuitive thing is that it takes a tiny number of bits to represent millions of stored items with few false yeses, so it's easy to have a fast index of indexes.

Everybody looks at it, until whoever it's for takes it off or it comes back around to you.  If you're on Hub Star Drive, you give the message to a boy named Hub and he delivers your message to all the homes in your neighborhood.  Supposedly, the people who it's not addressed to just throw it away. If you live on Switch Star Drive, you send your message by runner to the central home where a boy named Switch lives, and he runs it directly to the addressed house.  If you're way out in the country you might live in a Mesh Message community where any road might be blocked so everyone keeps a list of the members of the community and several neighbors who can be relied upon to forward messages on in that general direction until it arrives where it needs to go.  In every case there are special ""broadcast"" codes you can put on the message to address it to everyone at once, or to groups. These different ways of organizing message delivery are called topologies.  Each has its benefits and drawbacks.  These days Switch Star Drive is the most popular for local deliveries.

For long distance deliveries there's one post office address in your neighborhood  you address your message to for it to be forwarded on to the outside world.  This person is named ""Gateway"".  If you're the Gateway you have to have skills in getting messages to the wider world.  This is pretty easy if there's only one road to the wider world, called Uplink Highway - you just put everything on it.  When things come back you pass them along to the local neighbors.  The boy named Switch sometimes takes this duty, in which case he is promoted to Mr Router Switch because he knows the routes to the outside world.  All of the homes in your local delivery system are considered a delivery network.  Everything outside of it is considered the Wide Area Network.  Gateway might know several routes out of town in case one is blocked or congested. Gateway, or Mr Router Switch are the boundary between the local network and the other local networks so they are part of the inter-network or internet system.  There are many different internet systems, but the biggest and most popular one has grown so large we just call it The Internet with capital letters and all the others have to have individual names.  You are probably on The Internet because if you were one a different internet, you would probably have to know what your Gateway to The Internet was in order to post your question on The Internet like you did.

The Gateways and Router Switches have their own highway systems for messaging between each other.  They can have topologies just like your local network, with rings or loops or stars or mesh or other.

There are varying degrees of ""local"".  Outside of your neighborhood is a city, there are many cities in counties or regions, many counties or regions in a country, many countries in the world. This is called a heirarchy (say ""higher arky""). You can think of this like a pyramid where your message has to climb higher up the pyramid to the closest Router Switch that is above both your house and the destination house, and then get sent down the pyramid to the destination house. The inter-network isn't exactly organized along geographic boundaries like this, but it partly is because that's the fastest way to get messages delivered.  There are actually many overlapping pyramids that belong to various network owners like Comcast, CenturyLink and others.  Typically they're flat Mexican type pyramids with a mesh superhighway on top and Gateways to other pyramids. This part can be very complicated, but the general rule is that if you can't deliver the messages or break the internetwork everyone will kick you out of the system until you get your act together again, so they're usually pretty careful about that.

One of the interesting things about this system is that it's a ""best effort, non guaranteed delivery"" system.  Generally messages are sent without delivery receipts between points on the route.  If you need a receipt then you typically ask the recipient to send you one.  If you don't hear back after a set period of time, you can assume your message got lost, or the recipient isn't accepting messages right now for some reason.  We used to argue about this a lot but it turns out that this ""unreliable"" system is actually the most reliable and fastest system.

Another interesting thing is that the length of a message is quite limited.  For sending something like a photo, it is usually way too big to send in one of these network messages so you divide it up into chunks that fit and send the chunks (called ""packets"" or ""datagrams"") separately.  The receiver has to count them and put them in order and reassemble the photo.  In some cases your packets are too big, so some Router Switch or Gateway will break one into smaller packets and reassemble them.  Some of these packets might travel wildly different routes, taking very different amounts of time before arriving at the destination.

One more interesting thing: on the Internet you don't have just one address.  There are different methods for sending larger messages, streaming or sending block messages, sending messages intended for specific purposes like email delivery, web service or coordinating network communication.  These messaging methods are called ""protocols"".  Your address on The Internet includes 65,536 potential sub-addresses called ""ports"" that are typically reserved for the different types of messaging systems and you can be using many of them at the same time.

About addresses.  Homes or devices that are actually on The Internet are assigned an address number that is unique in The Internet's addressing scheme. This is called an Internet Protocol, or IP Address.  Actually only Gateways and machines that provide network services need to have them - your Gateway can give you a local address and knows how to translate these to find you.  Generally your Internet Protocol address is similar to other addresses close to you on The Internet, using various rule systems for assigning addresses as others have described here.  In reality any address can be located anywhere in The Internet and it's the network's job to deliver to it - but typically if you have an out-of-pattern address your network service provider who assigned it to you will make special arrangements for delivery.  When The Internet was first made up the inventor of the Internet Protocol got a lot of hassle for using an address system with an insanely large room for four billion addresses.  Caught hate for this because all those digits adds space to the messages that many felt was unnecessary. This was called IPv4.  It turns out 4 billion was nowhere near enough, and we have run out.  Now there is IPv6 with even longer address numbers and every particle in the universe can have its own IPv6 address.

China's been on very bad behavior lately.  They're pretty blatantly stealing US patents, sometimes when firms start manufacturing in China, other times when they hack into US Tech firms and steal designs in a more literal sense.  

Their human rights record is [pretty fucking bad](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45474279).  Part of me wonders if Trump's administration kinda envies how they treat Muslims and Immigrants. 

Freedom of Speech isn't a thing in China.  Nobody speaks out against the government or else you'll find yourself ""Camping"" with the Muslims in the middle of the world's driest desert.  

China is also testing several International Treaties with their [manufactured islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea_Islands).  See, there are a host of treaties that decide exactly where borders land.  In general, maritime borders are approximately 200km off the coast - even including shitty little islands that only have enough space for a flag.  

Previously, a chunk of sea was owned by Japan.  Then WWII happened and some treaties not everyone agreed to were signed that fuzzed the issue.  Nobody cared about the discrepency until someone discovered a shitload of oil in the South China Sea.  That's when China started building a chain of islands just big enough to stick a flag in to extend their borders into the oil-rich area.  

It's bad enough that the US has to go park a [Couple Thousand Feet of Freedom](https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/styles/desktop__1260_/public/main_images/Z14%20(1).jpg?itok=tBwFiakf) for ""Training"" between the Chinese and Japanese navies to make sure nobody ""accidentally"" starts WWIII. 

Then there's the fact that China is the primary financier of North Korea.  Know how all our smartphones are made in China using Rare Earth elements? NK is where those mines are, and China is their biggest customer.  Ethically fuzzy, but still pretty shit. 

Plus China is fucking the US out of several trade deals that we'd rather a US Corporation have.  That's classic greed, and being a sore loser, but still cause for war.  

Oh, and they are definitely putting backdoor access into all of the Chinese designed and manufactured phones like Huawei and can't 100% say they're not slipping it into the Samsung and Apple products they make too.  

This backdoor access lets them collect and aggregate data like Facebook and Google, but could also allow them to click on your microphone or camera if they want to listen in to a particular conversation.  You know, like Trump's vanilla [unsecured cell phone](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/president-trump-and-cell-phone-security/574096/).  

Open war with China pretty much means WWIII: Nuclear Apocolypse, which according to most experts would be ""Bad"".  

So, we fuck with them economically.  Chinese factories produce things for American citizens, and by taxing all imports from China, we make it more profitable for those products to be produced in the US.  In the short term that means higher prices for everything Chinese made (which is everything) until new factories are built and staffed so in the long term we're keeping those manufacturing jobs within the US.  

Meanwhile Chinese factories are stuck with nothing to do, because their biggest customer base isn't going to pay more than $12 for a new T-Shirt.  

However, China is also one of the biggest customers for US Coal, Grain, and Livestock.  Industries that tend to thrive in Republican areas.  China can hit back and start buying Russian Coal and Ukranian Grain.  This fucks over US Farmers who have to burn their fields, because nobody's buying, and they have to decide what to plant months in advance.

[],DeHackEd,,,[],,,,text,t2_zdw0a,False,,"For netflix in particular - and it's not all that different for different companies - it breaks down into 3 problems:

1) The user login and video browsing interface

2) Preparing the videos for users (aka encoding)

3) Serving the videos to users

#1 is fairly ordinary web site technology, though still at high scale since there are a lot of users it still largely works to centralize the process. #2 requires a lot of CPU power or specialized video encoding hardware, but for on-demand video the companies can wait while the video is processed until it's ready, and companies like Amazon basically let you rent servers by the hour so getting tons of CPU isn't hard if you have money to spend.

#3 is where the real logistical nightmare happens. When the amount of data gets big enough it's not practical to serve it all out of one server or even one datacenter. The big companies serve the video from many servers and/or datacenters around the world and make a conscious decision about which to use based on the user's location.

Netflix saw this problem coming and decided the right thing to do would be to build large servers, fill them with hard drives, fill the hard drives with their most popular videos, and ship them to ISPs for free and ask them to connect it directly to the network at 10,000 megabits+ connection speeds. I have seen one in person, and while it was an older model it was definitely a $5000+ machine when it was new. Of course they also put them in communal datacenters where lots of different ISPs connect and are quite open about connecting fiber optic cables between each other to feed the data. Netflix's servers described in item #1 know what videos are on every server and will direct users at the nearest server with the video they want to watch. Once a day starting around 2am (local time for where the server is) Netflix will start copying new data around the internet to these servers to keep them up-to-date since the internet is most quiet during those hours. As well as Netflix, Google also gives away free servers and has a presence in many datacenters all around the world for the performance benefit of Youtube, not to mention all their other applications like Maps, the Play Store, etc.

For companies that don't have their own servers around the world, there are 3rd party services that do and will let you pay for access to their services. These are called Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) and are not limited just to video. They distribute any big files, like application updates, for their clients.

DVR pause/rewind is actually a user-side problem. Pausing is easy - just stop requesting more data from the server and wait. Rewind and fast forward involve reconnecting to the server but asking for the video at the time the user has seeked to, or if it's a short jump forward or back the user may already have the data downloaded and saved.

Live video isn't that much different, but you need dedicated video encoding servers since you can't afford to wait/delay for them, and all those video storage servers need to be programmed a bit differently. Now it's important to fetch the live video from the source directly on-the-go. The downside is that the video gets delayed quite a bit - sometimes as much as 30 seconds from live, especially if you want that Netflix feature where the client image quality goes up and down depending on their internet speed. The industry has largely decided that longer delays from live are better than risking video stuttering and buffering for the user.",1566384205,{},exkcfyu,False,t3_ctcsl1,False,True,t3_ctcsl1,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ctcsl1/eli5_how_do_video_streaming_services_work/exkcfyu/,1566384206.0,1,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],ColdFerrin,,,[],,,,text,t2_el3sm,False,,"This might be a little too complicated for ELI5, but I'm going to give it a shot.

First I want to explain a little bit about the inspiration for USB. Before USB data storage was on floppy disks. Floppy disk drives are a type of what's called parallel communication which means that it's trying to send a bunch of very small pieces of data at the same time over a bunch of different lines, which means that all the lines have to be kept in perfect sync or the data will get jumbled up.
 
On the other hand USB stands for Universal serial bus. Now serial Communications is where you basically sent data by putting it in chunks called packets and then sending those packets as fast as you can. There are some physical limits to how fast you can send those packets of data, but because you're not trying to keep a bunch of stuff in sync it ends up being a lot faster.
 
In terms of hardware,  there are three important components in USB. The first is your USB device, whether that's a thumb stick, or other storage device. The second is the USB controller, and the third is your processor. 

The most visible component of this chain is the thumb stick. Thumb sticks are a type of flash memory, basically just a group of special circuits that know how to keep track of what you tell them even when there's no power. When you have enough of those circuits they can keep track of big numbers, so you can represent everything as numbers. 

The next component is the USB controller, which knows how to make your thumb stick talk to your CPU. Lastly and most importantly is your CPU which is the thing that's actually requesting the data.

So now let's go through the steps of what happens when you connect a USB thumb stick and then get data off of it to your computer:

1. The first thing that happens when you connect your thumb stick to your computer is the USB controller says, oh there's a new USB device there let me ask it what it is. The USB device will respond with some information about itself so that the controller knows how to talk to it.

2. Now that the USB controller knows how to talk to the device it's address to the device knows how to identify itself when data gets transferred. At this point the controller tells the CPU the device it address X exists.

3. Then when you asked for some data the CPU says to the USB controller give me data packets a through f on device X. And then the CPU goes on its merry way doing something else so that it doesn't have to wait on the data from the USB controller.

4. At this point the USB controller says to device X hey let's open up a connection I need some data.

5. Now the USB controller says to the thumb stick give me packet a, the thumb stick then responds you want a I'm going to start getting a.

6. At this point your thumb stick goes and starts getting packet a ready. At the same time the USB controller keeps asking the thumb stick is packet a ready over and over again. The USB stick will respond with wait up until the data is ready to be sent.

7.  when the date is ready instead of responding with wait the device says packet a is ready I'm going to send packet a. The controller says okay I'm going to receive packet a. The device will then send packet a, and once packet a gets there the controller says I have packet a if it got it. If it didn't then it's smart enough to say I didn't get it try again.

8. Then the USB controller will start the process over with the next packet of data that it needs.

9. Once it has all of the data trunks it needs it closes the connection and then the device sits there and waits for the next action.

10. At this point the data is being stored temporarily in the USB controller but now that it has all the data that was requested it interrupts the CPU and says hey your data is ready what do I do with it. The CPU will then either put it somewhere or do something to it depending on what you asked of it.

The Only Exception is if the amount of data you ask of it is more than the USB controller can store internally it may interrupt the CPU before all of the data is downloaded because it ran out of space and it needs to get rid of it before it can get more.

Now they can analyze the logs more to see some abnormal pattern. Eventually it will lead to only a handfull of candidate. Some investigation and someone will come out as guilty, or everyone else as non-guilty except one, so have to be that one.

Also, it is usually forbidden to have any usb keys, phone, mp3 player or anything that you can store anything on it.

note: usually https can't be intercepted due to the encryption and certificates. However in some environnement there will be a proxy. The proxy will have it's own certificate and will resign the data and all. Now the browser will see the wrong certificate, or another signing authority that isn't official. Normally it would trigger a big red alert, because it is the wrong/invalid certificate. But you can tell the browser to accept the certificate/signing compagny from the proxy. Now everything work flawlessly. If the site itself have a wrong certificate then the proxy detect it and block it, as would the browser do normally, so the security is the same.

The catch is, there is a difference between what the image was in reality, and how it was captured by the light sensors in the camera, which is determined by the camera's quality (the number of MegaPixels being one such measure). Beyond that, there is a difference between the raw image data that was captured, and the image data that was converted into numbers for storing in a computer file - the Encoding.

That Encoding process is what determines image quality. Sure, you could just directly describe every single pixel exactly as it was captured by the image sensors.

Image quality is simply how much data is being encoded in those bits, and how accurate it is to the real life subject. A video can be very big and have millions of pixels making each frame, or it could just be a couple thousand making it much, much smaller. 

Sometimes the way you ""translate"" the video to bits affects things. you might want to save some space, so you compress the video and try to make it so that it throws a bit of the information away that it can recreate ""well enough"" later. If that compression is too conservative it might throw away information you can't retrieve, and that makes the video look worse. 

Or it just might have been shot on an old camera that didn't provide enough information to make a better looking picture. The camera might have said ""Here are enough pixels to fill a 128 by 128 screen"" but then you try to view that video on a screen ten times as large: you can't guess what pixels could go in to the empty space, so you just stretch the image and call it a day, even if it looks really bad.",1566265352,{},exgj25b,False,t3_csqweo,False,True,t3_csqweo,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/csqweo/eli5_if_videos_are_basically_just_a_bunch_of_0s/exgj25b/,1566265354.0,1,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],maestro2005,,,[],,,,text,t2_6bkio,False,,"It's all about organization.

At a basic level, there's only two things that make up a program: data and algorithms. Algorithms are just operations that take some data and produce other data. For example, you sort a list: [4, 2, 3, 1] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]. Or you get the sum of a list: [1, 2, 3, 4] becomes 10.

Small programs have only a little data and a few algorithms, so organization isn't a problem. We can just put data wherever and have all of our algorithms in one big namespace, and it might be messy but we can make sense of it. But big programs have a lot of data and algorithms, so in order for us humans to not get confused we have to come up with a system to organize things.

Object-Oriented Programming is a system of organization. We group together pieces of data that go together and put them in classes, and we also put algorithms that only pertain to that data inside the class. Those internals are hidden from the rest of the world, so nobody else has to worry about them, they just interact with the class. So a class might have a bunch of data (called fields) and algorithms (called methods) inside of it, but then all of that gets bundled into one thing.

Then a class can have instances of other classes for its fields. And by grouping things together in a hierarchy like this, we can make sense of very large programs with tons of data and algorithms.",1566248734,{},exfumhs,False,t3_csl568,False,True,t3_csl568,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/csl568/eli5_how_does_object_oriented_programming_work/exfumhs/,1566248735.0,1,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],wizer900,,,[],,,,text,t2_7hs05,False,,"The big bois of OOP are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

**Abstraction** basically means, when you tell this program that's a calculator 2^(4) \+ 3 = ?, you don't know how it figured out the answer, but you know it did.

**Encapsulation** is how each object has 'ownership' of the things inside of it. Basically objects can't mess with data in other objects unless you explicitly allow for it.

**Inheritance** is just how it sounds, if you have a object inside and object, it can inherit the properties of the parent object. **Polymorphism** is altering the children despite what it can inherit.

For example, your house (parent) has two rooms (children) in it. The air conditioning is at 75 degrees. One room inherits the temperature of the house, 75 degrees. One room as a window unit (a method/function) that allows for it to either inherit the temp from the house (parent) or you can alter it with its own ac (Polymorphism).

Polymorphism is a bit more complicated than that, but for the sake of not having a long winded explanation, that's basically it.

OOP is sometimes preferred because of its abstraction and encapsulation. It only shows precisely what it has to show, so its a bit more secure, and polymorphism lets you code in a lot of alternate courses of action for the program to take for certain parts of the program.",1566241076,{},exfi5jx,False,t3_csl568,False,True,t3_csl568,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/csl568/eli5_how_does_object_oriented_programming_work/exfi5jx/,1566241077.0,1,True,,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think this starts out with someone writing AI that involves a simple algorithm that is densely packed with if and else statements - which is what some simple AIs actually are, e.g. Final Fantasy's turn-based AIs.

Then when people think ""well, if and else statements are in all code"", this is sometimes extended to ""all programming is just if and else statements"". Is it?

No. If and else statements are high level control flow constructs. They are important, but if you want to get down to it, programming is about writing a sequence of instructions. Control flow constructs like if and else are important in high level source code, but that's all you can say.

It wasn't bad per say, but i dont really have much glowing good things to say about it either.  IMHO KH3 took all the good from KH2 and improved on it, then took all the bad and made some of the best parts of 3. The gummy ship sections i hated before was some if my favorite parts in 3. They made it an open world you can roam and figh battles, hunt for rare items, and navigate complex structures while fighting you way through. 

They gave each keyblade unique powers,  from abilities, to forms, to summons. It was more than just more stats and a different cosmetic.  They incorporated those abilities along with ride theme battle abilities into the flow of combat flawlessly.  It never felt cluttered or choppy like i was afraid it would before playing it.

You got to keep all 3 party members on worlds and the individual world characters came along as back up, rather than having to abandon a core member and having level and gear difference.  They each brought unique battle commands. 

The story blew 2 out of the water, and they handled the lore problems well enough. 

The difficult didnt widely fluctuate like 2 did at times.  

The new graphics were meh at first, but they put them to full use later on and overall the game was beautiful graphics wise.

The theme song was actually a really good EDM remix done by skrillex and the girl who normally does the songs. Its not as memorable as simple and clean, but its close.

So, yeah. My only complaint was the stupid way they hamfisted social media and technology into the story,  and i felt like they kind of turned riku and sora into bland whiny androgynous final fantasy characters with spiky hair, or every FF protagonist ever. Those are really my only complaints and they are vastly overshadowed by what they did right.  Its a A+ in my book.  The ammount of content is insane and its easy to not realize.

Well, the atoms hit [the walls of their container] harder because they are moving faster, and in addition they hit more often, so the pressure increases. You see how simple the ideas of atomic theory are. 

If we take this and don‘t fix the density, but rather the pressure (gas in a room will always have very low pressure differences between different areas), then we can see that the density will decrease.
