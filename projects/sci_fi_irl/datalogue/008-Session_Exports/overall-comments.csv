That was said during the CNN Climate Crisis Town Hall, in case you believe Republicans made up the quote and printed it in all their propaganda papers.  Here's a transcript:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;QUESTION:  So my question is, what is your opinion on the prospect of  nuclear energy to help replace fossil fuels?  And do the risks outweigh  any potential benefits?    
   
&gt;  
&gt;WARREN:  So you rightly point out  about nuclear energy.  It's not carbon-based, but the problem is it's  got a lot of risks associated with it, particularly the risks associated  with the spent fuel rods that nobody can figure out how we're going to  store these things for the next bazillion years.    
   
&gt;  
&gt;So here's how  I see.  In my administration, we're not going to build any new nuclear  power plants, and we are going to start weaning ourselves off nuclear  energy and replacing it with renewable fuels over -- we're going to get  it all done by 2035, but I hope we're getting it done faster than that.   That's the plan.   

I don't give a shit about Elizabeth Warren, but are we seriously doing this in 2019?  Downvoting and accusing people of being Republican shills just because they posted something negative about your political candidate?  Grow up.

For all I know, adrianw could be a fucking white supremacist, but that their comment was sitting at -1 for no good reason and this post is even on the front page . . . it's pathetic.

&gt;Government customers also care very little about staying on the bleeding edge technologically, they prefer proven solutions.

This entire thread is about how the intel orgs have the bleeding edge and have had that for a long time. I guarantee you the major ones are very much on on the same tier at a minimum with Amazon and Microsoft with datacenters. They absolutely have exascale storage and data in 2019.

NASA probably doesn't, State Department probably doesn't, DoD in general probably doesn't. But NGA does. Imagery will never be discarded and a lot of imagery is produced and that is a lot of storage.

&gt;They're not interested in shrinking the datacenter. They're building bigger ones.

They *are* interested in budgets and funding. Biggers ones are more expensive. Shrinking the DC is a lot like shrinking transistors. It's more efficient. Government still depends on money, how they get revenue doesn't change that.

&gt;They also put out more BTUs per rack, requiring more cooling.

They may have higher operating temperatures, but they require *less* cooling because they don't need to worry about breaking mechanical parts. Plus they are certainly much more power efficient anyways, which leads to less heat demand. Most M.2 power draw is measure in miliwatts at idle.

im not denying evolution, and criticizing my finesse is not critiquing my arguments. 

&gt;The dividing line between evolution and adaption is fuzzy.

exactly. Evolution doesnt have to take a million years. 

&gt;You don't have evolution at a specific year, date, and month. This is why adaptation is a short term process compared to evolution as a long term process.

yeah but those are not the defining factors. 

&gt;If you tell someone you're going on a short walk, then you aren't heading to Mexico because that trip is fundamentally different.

I once went unicycling cross country... I crossed states on my unicycle. Your analogy is bad. 

&gt;If you're trying to create a new species, you aren't just focusing on the height of individuals. You're talking about changing enough about the species that its ancestors are fundamentally different creatures.

yes, and evolution doesnt just happen among different species that cant breed anymore. 


&gt;Surely you're smart enough to see that a red bike versus a blue bike is an entirely different comparison between a red bike and a Harley Davidson motorcycle.

yeah. as I own several bikes and a harlery, I know the difference. The color or the components are not a defining factor of evolution. 

&gt;What we are talking about is whether or not a predator would evolve to ""fill in the space"" when a prey population grows out of control.  Evolution is the last thing that will come into play in this situation. 

Yeah.. in talking about the immediate changes, sure. However - all I said was that evolution can happen way faster than millions of years and faster than a million years. That is true. 

&gt; Evolution simply doesn't have time to effect things in this manner.

Not if you are just talking about species changing their behavior. But that isnt the only affect. 

&gt;You don't see a new species of deer walking around every time the homeostasis between predator and prey gets thrown off balance. It's the same deer every year; there's just more or less of them.

Thats great! But that doesnt mean evolution couldnt happen faster than a million years. Deer just have fairly slow breeding cycles. Look at fruit flys if you want to see faster changes. 

&gt;The time frame is the only thing that determines evolution vs. adaptation. My first link makes this very clear. You quoted it yourself!

Profiling authoritarian leaders and followers

Research has long suggested that there may be distinct subpopulations of authoritarian leaders and followers within the broader population. We describe a latent profile analysis of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) in a New Zealand national probability sample (N = 18,248) that — for the first time — reliably identifies these two types. Consistent with the positive correlation between SDO and RWA, most people in New Zealand (about 91.2%) expressed comparable levels of RWA and SDO (i.e., moderate-moderate or low-low, but no high-high profile). Two small and distinct subpopulations diverted from this pattern, instead fitting a high-SDO/low-RWA authoritarian leader (1.2%) or low-SDO/high-RWA authoritarian follower (7.6%) profile. Authoritarian leaders tended to show the least concern for human rights, and were least willing to make personal sacrifices for the environment, but tended to support same-sex marriage, while authoritarian followers were particularly opposed to same-sex marriage, and yet highly supportive of human rights. These two profiles represent distinct subpopulations of people within society who are predisposed to seek dominance over others and those predisposed to unquestioningly follow them.

It's developing and validating those procedures, not the testing itself that's expensive, which is why economy of scale comes into play. I mentioned the weed industry because people might be familiar with the testing labels, that was probably a mistake.

It's expensive as all hell to develop and validate a procedure you're going to use for a handful of studies and never use again. The equipment isn't cheap for a research lab as it is for a dedicated analytical lab like is seen in weed business, but they probably already have access to it.

Also I've not lived in the USA for a while, but just because something is state legal does not mean it'd federally legal.

As for why making this stuff in bacteria is cool: It's orders of magnitude easier and cheaper to produce and extract the psilocybin on small scale because the bacteria is a known system with well documented extraction and purification methods. It's also nicer because the bacteria system is so well known and simple that they likely don't even have to purify it significantly for most uses in the study. They can characterize without any difficult extraction (just known methods) and then use it as is. 

It's also using a well known bacteria medicinally so they don't even have to worry about other active agents, contamination, or purification hardly at all, because everything this bacteria does and produces is a known factor, so they can hone in very precisely on just psilocybin .",1569727290,{},f1sd9w7,False,t3_dac724,False,True,t1_f1rb1ni,/r/science/comments/dac724/scientists_have_created_the_first/f1sd9w7/,1569729670,1,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0,,,

HIV enters healthy T cells through a specific and well known pathway that unfortunately, most of us have.  But, there are a rare few individuals that have a mutation in this pathway that allows them to be resistant to the virus in that they can be exposed to the virus but, the virus has nowhere to go once inside.  The “key” doesn’t fit the “lock”.

Which bring us to the 2 known patients that were both HIV+ and had leukemia.  They both received transplants from donors, by nothing more than luck, that each happened to have this mutation which was then inherited by the patient.  Since those new white blood cells were resistant to the virus entering them, the immune system eventually caught up and cleared the virus to below detectable levels (which is the best we can say) so we call that a “cure”.  Basically, these people got the golden lottery ticket; cured of HIV and leukemia. 

You’re next question is going to be why don’t we do that for everyone with HIV.  First, the donor pool is pretty small for this mutation.  Second, and most important, it would be dangerous to expose someone to radiation and chemo for a BMT when the cure is not certain and the possibility of death is always present.

More generally, to my thinking the most ""dangerous"" misconception is that Statistics is difficult to understand. If people are resistant to even basic concepts, there's little chance they can thrive in the modern world.  How else do you decide where to send your kids to school? Which car to buy? Or understand what a poll is actually saying?  And if you don't understand Coincidence is not Correlation, and Correlation is not Causality, it's all useless anyway.  

A new survey in the States makes understanding polls simple: it reported 3% of African American women support Donald Trump in 2020. The poll's Margin of Error is 3.5%.

That's not to say we should stop tossing out the occasional ""homoskedasticity of residuals"" or ""multivariate regression"" to make strong men weep and women swoon. Or vice versa, since 60% of my OR MSc class at LSE was women. Though being 20 years older than most I learned an object lesson in outliers.

[],srpskamod,,,[],,,,text,t2_l2xao1h,False,[],"Part of this answer is simple: the wavelength of radiation an object can emit is in no way limited by their size. Let's take a simple analogy, imagine you are standing on the short of a still lake with stick in your hand. If you tap the water periodically, you can create ripples that will radiate outward. You can control the rate of the ripples by how quickly you tap. If you tap slowly enough, then the wavelength can be much larger than your physical body.

In the same ways microscopic objects can radiate waves with a wavelength much larger or shorter than their characteristic dimension. Just in this case, the medium is not water, but the electromagnetic field and the stick is the light-matter interaction that transfers energy from the absorber/emitter to the EM field. Quantum dots are not really special in this sense. Even molecules and individual atoms, which are even smaller can emit visible light. Hell, even elementary particles which have no well-defined physical bounds and can be thought of as point particles such as electrons can emit visible radiation. For example the [blue halo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Advanced_Test_Reactor.jpg) in nuclear reactors comes from accelerating electrons. 

Now there is a caveat to the discussion above, which is that by and large it is more efficient to transfer energy to and from a given field when the receiver matches the physical dimensions of the wavelength of the radiation. So to take your example, individual quantum dots are actually much better at sloshing up a fraction of incident light than a molecule. We would say that its absorption cross-section is higher. Nevertheless, in the grand scheme of things it still absorbs relatively little light. If you wanted to maximize absorption, you could use something like an optical antenna. Such a structure, in analogy with regular antennas would be closer in physical dimensions to the wavelength of the radiation to maximize energy transfer in both directions, [as illustrated here](https://i.imgur.com/JOT6U9k.gif).",1569725033,{},f1s73b5,False,t3_dap0am,False,True,t3_dap0am,/r/askscience/comments/dap0am/how_do_quantum_dots_20nm_absorve_and_release/f1s73b5/,1569727203,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0,,1569725400.0,

[],Yttermayn,,,[],,,,text,t2_dsrk7,False,[],"I've read somewhere lately that when we remember things, we are actually reconstructing memories every time we remember them. We are also rewriting them in the process. Brains have a limited storage capacity and when storing a memory, we throw out information that was not relevant to the reason we are storing it. We also inject information into the memory,drawing on other memories depending on the requested information. For example, I remember my brother wrecking his bike into our Dad's vehicle. I may chat with my brother years later and wonder details about the vehicle. I don't remember what color the vehicle was, but I have another memory of my dad's truck and about where he used to park it, so I can guess that information and inject it into the memory of the wrecked bike. Down the road, when I will recall the bike wreck I will no doubt recall the details about the truck also. In turn this new memory may get referenced by another memory recall attempt.
Add to this system that how these bits of memory are organized is likely unique to the individual and require a functional brain to process them, and it seems unlikely that a machine could hope to recover memory from a dead brain.",1569713645,{},f1rbpxy,False,t3_d99yfp,False,True,t3_d99yfp,/r/askscience/comments/d99yfp/does_a_dead_brain_still_hold_information/f1rbpxy/,1569714205,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0,,,

I would think that if you can get cocaine into the hair by smoke, powder application, or soaking in a aqueous cocaine solution, you should be able to get all of it (or 99.999%) out of it with enough washes of the correct solvent, as I would only expect non-specific (e.g. hydrophobic or ionic, etc.) interactions to be holding the cocaine in the hair, and it should eventually all come back out via diffusion.",1569713617,{},f1rbnb7,False,t3_dagje4,False,True,t1_f1r8o9f,/r/askscience/comments/dagje4/how_does_cocaine_get_into_the_hair_structure/f1rbnb7/,1569714185,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0,,,

There are also applications in pharmaceutical synthesis, these are useful compounds for making phosphate derivatives. Phosphates are common in nature (the backbone of DNA is a phosphate chain) and several drugs contain phosphates or their unnatural analogues.

Whether EMPTA specifically is used for any of these I'm not sure.

No, not really, lol. Look: Pynchon's fun to read if you like a challenge and an author who makes you earn your reward.

Nobody ever came away from an art appreciation course with a lesser understanding; you still get to do the work and gain the reward.

With Pynchon (and others) I'll read an overview of the chapter first and even though I don't 'get' all of it I do get an idea about what's coming and then when I read the actual words I have a vague idea of where it is we're going. If I'm still kerflummoxed I can always go back and read the map again, you know?

Suzanne Collins' writing style just didn't appeal as much.

You mention how BR's intense violence isn't a good reason for the book being better, but I'd argue that the heavy violence fits more with the themes of the two books. Contestants are fighting to survive, it absolutely makes sense - perhaps even moreso in the context of BR considering some of these kids *really* didn't like each other prior to the battle and there was a whole emotional history going on.

I do want to say this though; discussion on which is better can be interesting discussion.

&gt;I'd rather my works pass into public domain within my lifetime than worry that after I die Disney is gonna scoop up the rights and keep anyone else from playing with them for another hundred years.

Could you elaborate on what you mean by ""playing with them""?

Sounds like you're talking not so much about existing works becoming free for public consumption, but rather future writers being prevented from publishing pastiches/fanfiction and profiting off of it.

So I think I was also just ready for expectations to be fucked with and new stuff to be tried. I don't remember expecting much, I was just expecting light sabers and Rey learning Jedi stuff, but I feel like I got more than I asked for. Including porgs. Who doesn't like porgs?

[],TheRealProtozoid,,,[],,,,text,t2_k2u2ux,False,[],"I've seen a couple of those reviews - but only online, so I'm guessing their a vocal minority, a very specific type of person who becomes incredibly upset when a movie doesn't obey the laws of science as they understand them. The vast majority of criticism that I've heard - and every single complaint I've heard from someone in person - is that it's boring. It's a combination of pacing and the audience not being engaged by the material.

That said, I have noticed that roughly half of the audience really likes it. It's an odd split. Half really enjoy it, and half think it's boring. There are outliers who love or hate it. I have a feeling that most people thought it was perfectly fine, we just don't hear from them because they don't feel strongly one way or the other. There is a psychological phenomena where people are more motivated to take action by negative emotion than positive emotion. As a result, negative opinions about things appear more common than they should, because people who thought the movie was good just aren't as motivated to say anything.

Science fiction movies seem to be particularly irritating to audiences. I think it's the tension between the science and the fantasy. Science fiction movies appeal to people who like science, but are actually generally works of imagination that support their story using science in order to create some suspension of disbelief. But the emphasis is on imagination, generally. I haven't seen Ad Astra, yet, but it appears to be more about feelings and ideas than science, sometimes putting feeling ahead of science in importance. A good example is the infamous tear that goes down Pitt's face in zero gravity. Some people think the tear should have floated away, but the director kept it. When a filmmaker deliberately ignores what the science enthusiasts believe should happen, they get out their pitchforks. Science enthusiasts are ironically very emotional about these things.",1569729926,{},f1sjyos,False,t3_daa5dm,False,True,t1_f1ofhh8,/r/movies/comments/daa5dm/whats_going_on_with_ad_astras_audience_score_on/f1sjyos/,1569732237,1,True,[],False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0,,,

Everyone got familiar with his personality on Punk’d, that it made it harder for us to buy him in very different roles, and he got a bit typecast.

Fewer death sentences. Fewer executions. A growing push to abolish in many states, many of which have succeeded, as other states put moratoriums in place.

The “liberal wing” of the Supreme Court has been wanting to revisit the issue of capital punishment as a whole for quite some time now. By the time the court has a chance to go majority liberal again, I bet enough states will have abolished that SCOTUS will consider capital punishment in violation of the 8th amendments based on their “evolving standards of decency” test, which they have already been using to narrow its use.

Additionally, all major Democratic Presidential candidates have come out in favor of abolition, while the number of conservatives who think it’s too costly to be worth saving is growing.

But I heard that the reason to avoid all these fake thc carts is cause of how they're made.

Simply put, because there exist no way to categorize the levels of purity in the carts, ( due to legalization issues), there are no rules/guidelines  into what goes in em.

As such, these carts are composed of the ground up left overs of the mj plants. This includes stems, leaves, root, fuck it throw in the seeds and dirt too.

The end product, a mixture of all the shittiest left overs barely gets you high cause its watered down with shit to produce even more oils.

Without any rules not only are you getting shitty weed in goop.form but a milieu of chemicals.

When I found out that these tanks are made with all the shit you wouldn't even roll a blunt with it made sense why they tasted so wierd that one time I tried a fake cart I picked up on the wrong coast.

It reminds me of when during alcohol prohibition, (not that I was alive then but I saw it on the history channel) people were getting sick while making their own alcohol because they were unknowingly making a type of wood grain alcohol that was in fact poisonous.

Beyond that her campaign had manipulated schedules so that debates wouldn't be watched, she had the panelists feeding her what the questions would be beforehand, etc.  

Clinton didn't come across as genuine and there was a downturn in percentage of eligible voters supporting the Democrats, even as trends indicate that it should've been increasing.

So let's analyze this. We can take this as hyperbole or a factual statement. I'm going to assume this is hyperbole because:

1)  Even the CEO, executives, and board of a company have families and friends that in all likelihood they believe are more important to them than shareholders.

2) Even if you were convinced the CEO, executives and board believed the shareholders are literally the most important people in the world what percentage of the global population believes that?  

So nobody is making this statement in fact.  

And the CEO, executive and board are employees of the shareholders. Just like any other job they are there to execute on the shareholders behalf, most likely to make the shareholders money because that is why the shareholders invested.  

If you don't believe this model is right for you, don't invest. In fact, you could take the opposite approach and start a non-profit where there are no shareholders and directly complete with the for profit company.

To be clear, I am not arguing that polluting or destroying our planet is a good thing. The old adage ""Don't shit where you eat"" comes to mind. We are supposed to take care of our world and show it the proper respect and care due our home. It is also fair to say that humanity should (and is) becoming more cognizant of our responsibility in that capacity. It is fair to say we haven't yet done enough and that things need to change. 

It is also to fair to say that we are trying. Solar power, wind generators, electric cars, better architecture and energy efficient technologies are all examples of humanity trying imperfectly to step up to shoulder these responsibilities. There are indeed other things that could be done. We could stop eating beef, for example, as cattle produce tremendous amounts of CO2. 

Yet, even if we stopped producing CO2 through all man made activities (except breathing), we would still be contending with increased CO2 emmissions in the form of destroyed forests from wildfires, hurricanes, floods, volcanoes, and other non-man-made events that contribute more cummulative CO2 than humanity has in total since the industrial revolution. 

We also have no real clue what any of this really means for the planet. The climate has changed before, multiple times, and yet here life is, still thriving.

You seem nice. 
     
&gt;hank you for proving my point that libertarians don’t distinguish between totalitarian governments and democratically elected governments, explaining why you are allies of the fascists.
   
This doesn't address anything I wrote/quoted. 
     
&gt;Calling democratically elected governments a “tragedy of the commons” is a twisted and dangerous mindset.
   
Hoppe didn't call the democratically elected government a tragedy of the commons, he argued it creates them. I can look for a more simply worded quote if that helps. 
      
&gt;Dangerous because anyone with a primary school education knows that the alternative is feudalism
   
Who knew people and organization were so simple?
     
&gt;those born wealthy entrench their power and their control of the world’s limited resources through force and the majority are born into slavery to serve the rich.
    
Competition, wealth creation via innovation, increases in resources due to innovation, seem to be missing in your scenario. 
     
&gt;Right now it is balanced between many different stakeholders - government, plutocrats, businesses, unions, citizens, consumers, etc.
     
As I wrote political power is non-virtuous. Whether this unethical behavior type is shared is irrelevant. The business/consumer relationship has nothing to do with political power, it is a voluntary interaction type. 
     
&gt;When you remove governments from the equation, it creates a political power vacuum that is quickly filled by the plutocrats
    
Assertion.

[],IamFerreira,,,[],,,,text,t2_4l8rg719,False,[],"“Knowing yourself” depends mainly on three  factors: genetics, karma (in a broader sense than ethical only) and environment. The first two factors can be summarized as follows: we can say that the basic nature of each human being is a mixture of two basic features, either emotional or rational in the sense of strict reasoning or, better saying, in accordance with sciences. I have strong reasons to believe that, graphically represented and considering the duality mainly emotional/mainly rational, the basic nature of all humans, or of all human in a country, is a Gaussian curve. So and concentrating mainly in the curve extremes, people are either strongly emotional or strongly rational. For me it is clear that it is much more difficult for emotional people to know thyself (it is the known problem of the emotional intelligence). But here comes in the role of external environment. That is and characterizing, I believe it is possible, for an emotional basic nature to get through its lifetime a good knowledge of itself and, on the other end, for a basic rational nature to get a bad knowledge of itself.

Things were going fine until I started seeing colors around us (I think they were our auras) and they kept fighting eachother mine was blue and hers was pink. But I was laying on my bed because I was no longer enjoying the high because I couldnt move and everything felt numb. She kept trying to do sexual stuff with me and i kept saying i was straight. I ended up not knowing it was real life because i was so high and she fingered and ate me out even though i couldnt feel anything touching my body. She got upset that I had no reaction but I couldnt move or speak and I didnt know that it wasnt a dream. She tried leaving but didnt make it down the stairs for whatever reason and slept in the guest bedroom. She admitted to her boyfriend the next day that she cheated. She even took off my bra and everything without my constant or knowledge. I hate having to act like everything is okay and if it ever got out I would die.

I refuse to go into detail about it with others so I made this account to finally be able to tell someone. It happened this year too. It breaks me down because I said no. I didnt want it to happen and i can never forgive myself for letting it happen to me.

1) The results indicate a significant decrease in grip strength as ulnar fingers (Ring + Pinkie) were excluded

2) Exclusion of the little finger from a functional grip pattern decreased the overall grip strength by 33%

3) n= 50 

If anything ~50% of the grip strength can be attributable to the ulnar digits

another paper (2004)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0894113004000766

' The percentage contributions of the index, middle, ring, and small fingers to grip were approximately 25%, 35%, 25%, and 14%, respectively.' 

'Grip and finger strengths were highly correlated. Anthropometric measures of body size or finger length were moderately correlated with strength measures. 

'These data suggest that there is a predictable pattern by which individual fingers contribute to overall grip strength, which is partially related to body size. The ulnar side of the hand contributes to the smaller proportion of overall grip (approximately 60% radial, 40% ulnar). '

&gt; The language known today as Spanish is derived from a dialect of spoken Latin, which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, beginning in 210 BC, and which evolved in central parts of the Iberian Peninsula after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. A written standard was developed in the cities of Toledo (13th to 16th centuries) and Madrid (from the 1560s). Over the past 1,000 years, the language expanded south to the Mediterranean Sea, and was later transferred to the Spanish colonial empire, most notably to the Americas.

* The 'f' makes the /f/ sound; no surprises there.

* The 'eu' makes the /œ/ sound; this is true for almost every time you see it. However, it is right next to another vowel sound:

* The 'ille' tends to make an /ij/ sound by itself. But French speakers simplify this to a /j/ sound since /œij/ would have too many vowel-y sounds (like how in English 'cupboard' has too many consonants and so becomes 'cubbuh(r)d', or /kʌbəd/ for the IPA readers out there).

So in this case, the 'feu' + 'ille' makes a distinct 'oy'-ish sound /fœj/ (three distinct sounds), which is why it sounds quite different from the 'eu' sound in 'feu' /fœ/ (only two sounds). 

(Fun fact: the way I learned the 'eu' sound is by shaping your lips like you're about to say 'o', but then saying 'e' instead. This also works for German 'ö')

* base load - cheap power that can run 24/7, slow to turn on and off (coal, nuclear)
* load following - more expensive, but can be turned on an off quickly to meet demand (diesel, hydro)
* intermittent - power generation that depends on current conditions (solar, wind)

The problem is it is very difficult to store energy, you pretty much have to generate as much power as you are currently using.  That means the best solar and wind can do is supplement base and load following power generation, you are always going to need power that works when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing.

As for hydro, you need more than just a river.  The amount of power a hydro dam can generate is in proportion to the change in elevation between the top and bottom of the dam.  If you don't have change in elevation, it doesn't matter how much water you have, you can't generate very much power.

Nobody have infinite amout of time and money to build all of those, so you can only build a certain amount each year. On top of that, we already have power plant that produce electricity, so either you wait for more demand and build new power plant at a slow rate, or you need to decomission older power plant and replace them by new, which add cost and waste the money you already spent to build those older power plant. 

2) Hydroelectric power plant need a reservoir, you basically put a dam that slow the rate of flow, fill up a reservoir and use that to power your turbine. The more you build on a river, the smaller the flow at the end of the river. On top of that, river with enough flow to power hydroelectric power plant are rare, so we something need to change the path of a river to combine for the power plant. This kind of thing cause massive international conflict that could lead to war, Turkey built several hydroelectric power plant and this leave a lot less water for Syria and Iraq, same between Egypt and Ethiopia and same with China and South East Asia. That water is needed for people to drink, agriculture and hygiene, so there is a limit on how many of those plant you can build upstream.

3) Wind and Solar panel have a huge problem, they are not a stable source of electricity. Electricity demand peak in the morning and evening, while solar produce at noon where there is a bit less demand. That mean that a large portion of the electricity you produce with solar and wind can be completely useless, because people don't need that energy that the moment you produce it and you don't produce enough energy when people need it. So either you build a LOT of them to that when you have peak demand you produce enough energy, but the amount of solar and wind you need for that it so high that the price of your electricity will be really high. The other solution is to have wind and solar only be a portion of your electricity production and have other source like coal or natural gas that compensate when solar and wind don't produce enough to meet the demand. That will be a problem until we develop and produce enough batteries to stock energy at peak production and use that energy during peak demand. But we are FAR from that.

So ya it's possible to do what you are saying to an extend, but that would mean skyrockting the price of electricity, especially in place where there isn't that sunny or windy.",1569729223,{},f1si6te,False,t3_daq5k4,False,True,t3_daq5k4,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/daq5k4/eli5_why_cant_we_just_build_more_turbines_dams/f1si6te/,1569731586,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0,,,

I wouldn't say Spanish has kept pronunciation for the same reasons above and below. It was adapted to its speakers.
But Korean fits this description of being pronounced as written because modern Korean was constructed to be so.

So why isn't English pronounced the way it's spelled? As logical as it would seem from convenience and efficiency in learning, languages don't always evolve that way. They become designed that way once speakers become aware of their sound and written language and try to find ways to standardize it so it's easier to educate others and make the population literate. This is what happened with Korean. The Chinese characters didn't exactly fit the pronounced language. So they designed a written language to fit their pronounced language (Korean characters literally tell you how to make the sound in your mouth) to make it easy for everyone to learn and be literate. But for a language to change like this takes strong influences, like an effective government and education system.

But languages don't always turn out this way because native speakers get used to inconsistencies and inconveniences. People learn to adapt to the 'logic' of their language. And in the case of English, you just have to learn those awkward pronounciations ( thought, night, this, house, mice, exam ) because a lot of foreign influences over hundreds integrated into English.

First there was the Germanic Old English.
Then the Romans came, left, then came back with Caesar and established some of the latin in our grammar and alphabet.

Then the Vikings raided and gaves some cool words like that start with sk, sky and skill.

Then the Norman french invaded and slowly killed off Germanic Old English after making French the court language for awhile, which is why English has a lot of French vocabulary that trickled to the peasantry. (Colour, battle, castle) Apple used to refer to all kinds of fruit in general rather than just a Red Delicious or Granny Smith.
It wasn't until around the Tudor era that Early Modern English broke out of the French from court. We also had the Great Vowel shift where our pronounciation of vowels in words went rose in the mouth. 

Colonialism and Exploration added some words from Dutch, German, Spanish, and Portuguese into English because of over seas trading.

And by this point the printing press was made so more people started to become literate and read and write in English. But everyone had their own way of spelling and writing conventions.
Dictionaries and rules of style to standardize English were slowly being established mostly in the 1700s by a lot of educated men who had their own ideas of what proper grammar and spelling for English should be, like Samuel Johnson for the British and Webster for the Americans. (This is why the British spell Colour and Americans Color.)

To create a hoverboard you have to do one thing counteract gravity.

There are many ways to do that:

- Force something down so the board is forced up, such as a water jet, or chemical reaction

- Magnetism. Similar magnetic poles repel each other. But requires the ground to be magnetic limiting usefulness.

- Quantum trapping. An extension of the magnetic option. By making the board out of super conducting material it locks the board hovering in place. https://youtu.be/VyOtIsnG71U
Requires super conducting materials which currently only exist at very cold temperatures.

- low density materials. Air is a fluid. Material density impacts positioning within that fluid. Put enough  gas that's lighter than air and it'll float. Amount of gas required to offset a person's weight would not be feasible.

Increasing the density of the materials used is probably the worst thing to do if you're trying to make a hoverboard, because increased density means increased weight means higher gravitational effect.

The only feasible future option would be in the future if we were able to figure out what exactly causes gravity and we were able to figure out how to control it then we could counteract earth's gravity locally to make something hover.

Waterproofing can be done without making batteries sealed in but if the case has no way to open it, the water proofing is better. In the case of irremovable batteries, this isn't the case most of the time, they just glue the battery in.

Candelas are the measure of the amount of light going in a particular direction (""luminous intensity"").  How many directions are there in 3D?

Steradians are a measure of solid angles, like square degrees, but they're based on there being 2п radians in a circle, as opposed to 360 degrees.

So candelas are defined to be lumens per steradian.  If you have a plain bulb with 1257 lumens lighting equally in all 4п (12.57) directions then that bulb will have an intensity of 100 candelas.

Now put a perfect plane mirror behind the bulb so that half the light is reflected back.  Now your 1257 lumen bulb has an intensity of 200 candelas in front of the mirror (and 0 behind).  You could use a parabolic mirror to focus the light as with a flashlight.  If you could somehow make all the light go in exactly one direction then you could have an infinite number of candelas.

Sure, English has a lot of Latin influences, but Latin and its descendants never used the word 'do' to make questions and negate sentences in the way that [English does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-support). Latin and its descendants never combine nouns together by itself to form bigger nouns: you can say 'apple juice' in English, 'Apfelsaft' in German and 'appelsap' in Dutch, but in French, you have to say 'jus **de** pomme' and in Spanish 'jugo **de** manzana', and in Italian 'succo **di** mela'; all of these translate to the 'juice of apple', with the 'of' connecting the two nouns. To say 'pomme jus', 'manzana jugo' and 'mela succo' would just be incorrect. Patterns like these are vital to the study of language history, and so they are important distinctions to make for linguists.

This is important because people make crazy claims that two languages are *related* just because they have the same words. Related is a technical term that means they were once the same language but eventually diverged due to dialectal differences. A lot of colonial languages have borrowed words from Europe due to extended contact, but no one would make the argument that the Philippine languages are related to Spanish just because even the most common words come from Spanish.

[],CanalAnswer,,,[],,,,text,t2_43jcknk5,False,[],"Short version: The Latin-based words in English haven't shifted much. Ditto, Spanish. The Germanic/Old English words *have* shifted lots, because they're not used as much by the posh people who controlled Standard English and therefore controlled the pronunciation of English. Also, the spellings *used to be* phonetic but they only reflected the pronunciations that the 1% used. So, from the very start, the spellings were all jacked up.

English was given standardized spelling in the 15th Century by the Chancery, a government agency (king's court, whatever). The spelling was based on the way words were pronounced within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle, a chunk of England where rich, posh, well educated people lived. This led to two problems.

1. Other accents, other dialects (subgroups of English), etc. were ignored.
2. As pronunciation shifted, both inside and outside the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle, spellings didn't keep up. Therefore, over time, spellings ceased to reflect the pronunciation.

Spanish is heavily derived from Latin. So are Italian, Romansch, Languedoc, Romanian, French, and ... something else. That's why their spelling and pronunciation didn't shift all that much. They're Romance languages, which means they're balls-deep in Latin. (That's a technical term.)

English, on the other hand, is primarily Germanic. It uses a lot of French and Latin because of the Norman Invasion and the Catholic Church respectively. Still, there's always been a tension between the two groups of words. Old English (AKA Anglo Saxon, AKA pre-1066 'English') words tend to be pronounced *very* differently from Latinate (AKA Latin/French/romance) words.

If you look at the posher, more highfalutin' words, they're Latinate and their pronunciation hasn't shifted that much. Check this out. ""I desire to inquire as to the propinquity of my artisanal cutlery. Your concomitant reply is appreciated."" It sounds pretentious because it's all Latinate. The bigger words' pronunciation hasn't shifted much because they're Latinate and share much with Spanish/French/etc. 

Now, try the inkhorn (more Germanic) version. ""I want to ask where my stuff is. Tell me. Thanks."" Much more casual, much more 'common', and much more prone to shifts in pronunciation. 'Want' was *vanta*. 'Ask' was *ax* or *ascian*. Stuff was *stoppian*. Thanks was probably *tanke* or something.

Compare that to 'desire' (French *desirer*, Latin *desiderare*), 'inquire' (French *enquerre*, Latin *inquirere*), etc. The Latinate words are so close to Latin that you can almost understand high-register English without studying it, if you know enough Latin.

Now, consider this. The posh folks who controlled English spelling also controlled Standard English pronunciation, either consciously or unconsciously. (Think about Downton Abbey and how influential it is. Then, think about monks, politicians, and aristocrats. They control the schools, which produce the next generation of high-register English speakers, and so on.) So, not only do the 1% control the money, but they also control how high-register English (Latinate English) evolves. Pronunciation won't shift much, because spelling won't shift much, because the spelling of Latinate words doesn't usually *need* to change, because the pronunciation is already set by the Oxford-Cambridge-London triangle. It's quite circular in reasoning and in feedback.

Common English, AKA inkhorn English, AKA low-register English, can evolve much more and *does* evolve much more. There are 100 dialects, 200 regional accents, etc. and most of them contain words and phrases that pre-date the Norman Invasion. Fore example, Geordie contains a surprising about of Danish. Naturally, those words didn't make it into Standard English. Still, the spellings of inkhorn English could evolve in those communities because most people spoke two dialects anyway (Standard English and the local dialect of English). The 1% felt no need to regulate non-standard dialects, and hoi polloi felt no need to kiss the 1%'s ass by tweaking their own spellings.

Eventually, as I said, the Chancery did standardize inkhorn spellings, but no one really paid attention to *speaking* in those spellings. The spellings *were* phonetic briefly, but they were standardized about the Oxford-Cambridge-London pronunciation! So, from the very start, the spellings did not reflect the way that most English-speakers talked. Matters worsened as the centuries passed, because English evolves... and whereas Latinate words' pronunciations stayed true to their roots (because the 1% tried super-duper hard to keep on speaking 'nicely'), the inkhorn words' pronunciations shifted all over the bloody shop (because that's what happens when normal people speak normal English in 200 different ways).",1569727294,{},f1sda9t,False,t3_damdqg,False,True,t3_damdqg,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/damdqg/eli5_why_have_some_languages_like_spanish_kept/f1sda9t/,1569729673,1,True,[],False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,0,,,
