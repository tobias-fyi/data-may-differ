1,[],HawkbringerandStubby,,,[],,,,text,t2_45y9rsdb,False,[],"I had to read a few of the other comments to remember this book: Invitation to the Game by Monica Hughes, here at Good Reads: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146499.Invitation\_to\_the\_Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146499.Invitation_to_the_Game)

It's a short YA dystopia-sci-fi novel, and I read it for school in 8th grade. I had just been pulled from my advanced LA-Reading class that was presided over by a mean-spirited, verbally abuse, physically diminutive white woman of approximately 75 years of age. What an asshole she was. PERFECT fit for a juvenile hall prison guard. Which was one of her previous jobs, she told us once. REALLY should not have been in charge of fragile middle schoolers. I truly hope she's dead by now so she can't hurt anyone else like me.

I was cleared to move into the regular LA-Reading class about halfway through the school year, after my parents contacted the principal after I told them about the insane crap she'd said, and this was the first book I read with them. It's not amazing by any means, not original, not award-winning. Just another cheap paperback of about 140 pages, the type you might pick up at a Scholastic book fair. But it struck a chord with me. 

At the risk of spoiling its main plot twist, the characters, a group of 10 teens, graduate school and then are immediately  forced into an unemployment slum in this dystopian future, (Because labor automation from robots), and they have to scrounge, thrift, DIY, and straight-up steal to make a habitable location for themselves in the slums. Then the Big Plot happens and they have to start over again, from the literal Stone Age, weaving fishing lures out of the brushed-out hair of their resident artist, smelting their own bronze and iron, firing their own clay pots. The last chapter of the book has the protagonist sitting down with her pet project, a handmade book, and she begins to write the first sentence of the book, as though this whole novel has been her autobiography.

This book introduced me to the idea that, after school, I might be forcibly unemployed (which, big surprise, actually happened to me because disability) but that I could still DO things. 

That my specialization might in fact be valuable to a group - they had a historian, a geologist, a woodworker-musician, a psychologist, a hunter, all of whom were more than one-dimensional stereotypes. (Not MUCH more than one-dimensional, but there were 10 of them, and it was a short novel.) 

That you have NO IDEA how far from home you might wind up in the course of your life, but that the things you did in The Before Time can and will support you through it.

Also introduced me to the idea of developing a 'robust post-apocalyptic skill set.' I'm pretty sure it was after that year that I got into sewing and darning. Had to stop eventually, because disability, but I do have that skill to fall back on if it's ever REALLY needed. 

I try to re-read it once a year to see if I can get anything else out of it as I age. Haven't unpacked it from last year's move yet, but that book will never leave my mind.",1569518806,{},f1j4zyi,False,t3_d9d5jx,False,True,t3_d9d5jx,/r/suggestmeabook/comments/d9d5jx/what_book_are_you_most_enthusiastic_about_one/f1j4zyi/,1569518926,1,True,[],False,suggestmeabook,t5_31t41,0
