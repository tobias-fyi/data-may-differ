4,[],Cyaed,,gray,[],,Discordian Ethicist,dark,text,t2_tf6ig,False,[],"""Wasting"" qubits is a fait accompli of general purpose quantum architectures. They need to be spent on error correction. Classical computers also ""waste"" transistors - look up parity bits some time. If it still seems like quantum computers are inherently worse.... Well, they are. Right now, the best quantum computers are around where classical computers were in the 1960s at best. Still, though: while a quantum computer might be worse that a classical computer for the types of problems that classical computers excel at, if we use it for that problem, we're doing it wrong.

Computer algorithms are classified according to their *time complexity*. This is a measure of how fast they run. Two important classes are P and NP. P stands for **P**olynomial time complexity. Any algorithm in P runs in an amount of time that can be described as a polynomial. NP stands for **N**on**p**olynomial, and contains algorithms that - as you increase the amount of data they need to crunch - are eventually slower than anything in P. 

Quantum computers are special because they can run algorithms in yet another time complexity class called BQP at the same speed as a classical computer runs algorithms in P. When a classical computer tries running something in BQP, at best it will run BQP in NP, and at worst it will run in an even slower time complexity like EXPTIME (time complexity that can be described with an exponential).

Being able to tackle BQP problems in polynomial time means being able to do things like directly simulate protein folding without any simplifications, or being able to do a brute force search for room-temperture superconductors considering thousands of cnadidate materials a day - currently scientists have to figure out how to manufacture a material before they can determine superconductivity. By the same token, we would be able to create evolutionary algorithms to build nanomachinery, or to create hyper-effective drugs and then verify that they were safe digitally by making sure they didn't interact with any biomolecules. Imagine artificial viruses that only killed cancer cells with total lethality. The standard model of physics is good enough that if we had the machines, we could simulate the universe in acceptable detail to fully digitise and automate  - but classical computers aren't those machines.

Quantum computers *are*.

That we have to spend a few qubits dealing with the uncertainty doesn't change the fact that a quantum machine will be able to do in minutes what would take a classical computer the size of jupiter longer than the expected lifetime of the universe to accomplish, in it's field of excellence. Don't knock it.

(That said, the D-Wave machine is not a quantum computer and more than a bitcoin mining ASIC is a computer. It just implements one algorithm, and not one of the world-shattering ones. The state of the art for world shattering is google's machine, with two powers of ten less qubits, which isn't enough for any of the really awesome applications.)",1569490848,{},f1hd3do,False,t3_d9f43u,False,True,t1_f1grv4k,/r/Futurology/comments/d9f43u/dwave_announces_first_sale_of_its_5000qubit/f1hd3do/,1569490857.0,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary

Background

Deep learning offers considerable promise for medical diagnostics. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning algorithms versus health-care professionals in classifying diseases using medical imaging.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Ovid-MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index for studies published from Jan 1, 2012, to June 6, 2019. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals based on medical imaging, for any disease, were included. We excluded studies that used medical waveform data graphics material or investigated the accuracy of image segmentation rather than disease classification. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. Studies undertaking an out-of-sample external validation were included in a meta-analysis, using a unified hierarchical model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018091176.

Findings

Our search identified 31 587 studies, of which 82 (describing 147 patient cohorts) were included. 69 studies provided enough data to construct contingency tables, enabling calculation of test accuracy, with sensitivity ranging from 9·7% to 100·0% (mean 79·1%, SD 0·2) and specificity ranging from 38·9% to 100·0% (mean 88·3%, SD 0·1). An out-of-sample external validation was done in 25 studies, of which 14 made the comparison between deep learning models and health-care professionals in the same sample. Comparison of the performance between health-care professionals in these 14 studies, when restricting the analysis to the contingency table for each study reporting the highest accuracy, found a pooled sensitivity of 87·0% (95% CI 83·0–90·2) for deep learning models and 86·4% (79·9–91·0) for health-care professionals, and a pooled specificity of 92·5% (95% CI 85·1–96·4) for deep learning models and 90·5% (80·6–95·7) for health-care professionals.

Interpretation

Our review found the diagnostic performance of deep learning models to be equivalent to that of health-care professionals. However, a major finding of the review is that few studies presented externally validated results or compared the performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals using the same sample. Additionally, poor reporting is prevalent in deep learning studies, which limits reliable interpretation of the reported diagnostic accuracy. New reporting standards that address specific challenges of deep learning could improve future studies, enabling greater confidence in the results of future evaluations of this promising technology.",1569409512,{},f1e1jjd,True,t3_d91paq,False,True,t3_d91paq,/r/Futurology/comments/d91paq/ai_equal_with_human_experts_in_medical_diagnosis/f1e1jjd/,1569409522.0,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key characteristic of current times is the width of the palette of options and the modular nature of them.

They can even find you staff, from top to bottom. Component parts can be sourced from multiple sources with complete reliability. Software and electronics can be endlessly reconfigured. 

People will be aware of genetic algorithms. Tens of thousands of virtual prototypes are tested against a simulated environment, and those which jump the hurdles set for them pass their characteristics on to the next generation. They are used for everything from wingtip design to passenger concourse optimisation. Nobody thinks of the prototypes that are discarded.

When you actually look into it lithium mining it is done in brine pools which is done in an environment with very little life and the damage is minimal (a lot less that normal mining), the qualities of lithium available is huge and batteries are actually recyclable. Maybe is isn't recyclable at every town but that is because the infasucture needs updating not that your can't recycle them.

So that in isolation solves the car issue. Electric cars being greener and generally better (less moving parts, higher acceleration, more efficient) cost is an issue but is dropping rapidly.

So let's move onto the electrical grid. I was talking to a consultant in the energy industry. It is his job and what his company specialise in. To be clear we are talking about the United Kingdom here, a small country that has higher demand for energy in the winter and has a large and growing amount of wind power (with solar also). I asked about the move to renewables. He seen it as inevitable. He said there was a number of things going on. The power generation is spread out all over Europe and Europe is increasing joining it's energy markets together with various methods including HVDC. So this averages out the variable production, wind is always blowing somewhere in Europe. Next companies buy energy when it is cheaper (that is some of what his company does) this is the free market I was talking about. It is competitive and energy demand is varied to when supply is cheap. Equally all the electric cars that will be purchased can choose when to power up, so this is where algorithms come in and energy is purchased when supply is high and demand is low again levelling it out. He seen no issue at all with the energy grid going fully renewable. (We would leave our hydro and possible our nuclear) 

Energy might be dumped when supply is really high and demand really low. But that doesn't mean it is unprofitable, just because you do not make money 1/10 of the time doesn't mean to can't make a profit of the other 9/10 of time.

&gt; The goal of earthquake forecasting has never been to predict slow slips. Rather, it’s to predict sudden, catastrophic quakes that pose danger to life and limb. For the machine learning approach, this presents a seeming paradox: The biggest earthquakes, the ones that seismologists would most like to be able to foretell, are also the rarest. How will a machine learning algorithm ever get enough training data to predict them with confidence?

&gt;The Los Alamos group is betting that their algorithms won’t actually need to train on catastrophic earthquakes to predict them. Recent studies suggest that the seismic patterns before small earthquakes are statistically similar to those of their larger counterparts, and on any given day, dozens of small earthquakes may occur on a single fault. A computer trained on thousands of those small temblors might be versatile enough to predict the big ones. Machine learning algorithms might also be able to train on computer simulations of fast earthquakes that could one day serve as proxies for real data.",1568965361,{},f0v5vqz,False,t3_d6ptok,False,True,t3_d6ptok,/r/Futurology/comments/d6ptok/artificial_intelligence_takes_on_earthquake/f0v5vqz/,1568965362.0,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; If I attempt to predict if any one person will shoplift something, the confidence of my prediction is undefined.

No it is not. I don't know how many more goddamn examples you need. I've given you jelly beans, weather forecasts, coins, and pointed to the literature explicitly explaining this.

The probability that any one guy will shoplift is 20%. The probability that your next coil flip will be heads is 50%, the probability that the next jelly bean I pull out is red is 75%. This *basic* statistics, and its exasperating explaining this to you repeatedly. 

You also clearly don't understand the context in which you should be using confidence intervals. 


&gt;You are wrongfully making the assumption that human beings make decisions according to a statistical model. They don't. 

No, they just happen to make decisions that collapse into our repeatable and empirical probability distributions when aggregated *by magic*. 

I don't know how many times you need to hand held through the statement ""Probability distributions are not omniscient seers of the future"" and again point out that while you wouldn't know who exactly is going to reoffend you know the *relative probability* that a person belonging to population X will reoffend. 

&gt;The reason this is so important: Let's say WalMart charged you 1% extra over female customers to offset the cost of your shoplifting.

Walmart doesn't do this but we see this all over the place. Many places tax alarm systems because they end up wasting public resources on false alarms. Does everybody's alarm system end up causing a false alarm, No. Does it make sense to tax the obvious public externality this represents. Yes. 

&gt;That's why we can't allow this situation to exist.

How do you think the parole system currently works sans algorithms? Please explain, because I don't think you have a clue. 


I could show statistically that granting parole using relative risk profiles results in more people who will not reoffend being granted parole and less people who will reoffend not being granted parole compared to our current system that does not take these factors into consideration but we are going to need to get you past the ""What is the probability that the next coin flip will be Heads"" is unknowable level of statistics before that happens...",1568843949,{},f0pqyg6,False,t3_d5gl19,False,True,t1_f0ppmf7,/r/Futurology/comments/d5gl19/bernie_sanders_became_the_first_presidential/f0pqyg6/,1568843950.0,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Okay so you've decided to argue from principle instead of the statistics here and its telling. Let's change the hypothetical to ""ISIS gets the $10 for requirement if tails vs $100 to a charity that provides lifesaving medication in Africa if heads"". You should still take that bet because know the underlying probability distribution. Same with the hurricane. You should still not take that bet because you know the underlying pdf of a hurricane in Kansas. In this case there is clear harm when you are wrong and there is clear benefit when you are.right. 

&gt; You don't choose a harsher sentence for someone just because it's a ""good bet."" 

Okay so Al Capone should have gotten  the same chance at parole as anyone else who committed tax evasion. This is typical principles above sense thinking. 


&gt;Just because a factor is ""indicative"" of recidivism does not mean it's admissible as evidence

It is absolutely ""admissible"" in parole hearings and is actively used in such cases. 

 &gt;Hair color is ""indicative"" of recidivism

It's not. 

 &gt;Ideally parole boards would not even *know* the parolee's hair color.

Why have them at all in your formulation. Same sentence for everyone accused of any given crime and we can either just skip parole hearings all together or we can just use a random number generator because apparently its unjust to treat different circumstances differently. 


&gt;No, you've misunderstood me. What I'm trying to communicate is that individuals *do not have* a ""probability"" of recidivism. 

An individual *follows* a probability density function is the proper way to phrase it. A sample taken from a population with a known pdf *has* some probability of X according to that pdf. 

&gt;If a model returns a 50% recidivism rate for a certain demographic, then it does not mean that each individual in that group has a 50% chance to re-offend.

Ignoring sample variance, it would mean that if you took one of those people at random the probability that they would reoffend is 50%. 

 &gt; Half of the individuals did not reoffend, and half of the individuals did. 

Yes the probability that one of them if selected randomly would reoffend is 50%. This is what people mean when they say this person represents a 50% recidivism risk. It's what people mean when they say ""there is a 75% chance the 100,001rst jelly bean is red"".


&gt; The model does not know which is which. 

For fucks sake, yes we have gone through this repeatedly. The model can you the relative likelihood someone will reoffend. It cannot tell you who exactly will reoffend. I do not understand why I am forced to repeat this again. 

You have two groups of 10. In one 8 will reoffend and in the other 1 will reoffend. You dont know beforehand who will and who won't reoffend. If you care at all about things like reintegration and rehabilitation and societal health you would not treat these groups exactly the same.

&gt; you're skating around this very important facet of the math.

I haven't skated around anything and I'm not the one who claims to teach students (!?) that we can't know ""What is the probability that the next coin flip will be Heads"". A question I imagine they reflexively got right and you somehow managed to bungle. 

&gt;while being black (for example) is ""indicative"" of recidivism, 

Again likely as a result of collider bias, as demonstrated by the fact that these algorithms do not know the individuals skin color but can accurately bin their recidivism risk. 


&gt;The same is necessarily true of any inborn trait not directly correlated to recidivism, for exactly the same reasons.

Again race is not at all the same as socioeconomic history, educational history, finance history, history of affiliation with known criminals, etc and none of those factors are inborn traits.

Furthermore, there people with certain psycopathies (an inborn trait) that make them far more likely to reoffend.  That should absolutely be a discussion when it comes time to grant parole or not.

I get it, you care very strongly about a principle you have constructed and that can't be violated (although it absolutely already is by how we do sentencing and parole hearings regardless of algorithms) regardless of the societal outcomes. I care about things like not keeping people behind bars who represent no threat to themselves or others, rehabilitation for criminals, and I don't want to be granting parole for people who are danger to society. As a result, I prefer systems that incorporate relevant information into their decision trees.",1568836799,{},f0pkvy9,False,t3_d5gl19,False,True,t1_f0patd7,/r/Futurology/comments/d5gl19/bernie_sanders_became_the_first_presidential/f0pkvy9/,1568836801.0,1,True,[],False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean this in the nicest way possible but please tell me you don't teach statistics. 


&gt;Notice how for a single trial, the confidence interval becomes undefined.

You are killing me here. I agree that if you pluck one person from an unknown population, and measure something your confidence interval is meaningless. *That isn't what we we talking about*. 

Economists/Criminologists/social scientists take large samples and use that data to underpin a frequency rate characteristic to the effect variable. I am not saying that sampling, endogeneity, or a host of other issues that bias estimators cannot happen. I'm saying if they have happened in the literature you need to demonstrate it.

Let's again go back to jar of jelly beans, and let's say it's a massive jar containing 7 billion jelly beans. This means I haven't sampled much of the population. If I take 100,000 samples which return 75% percent red jelly beans, can I saying about the 100,001rst bean? 

Yes, of course you can. 

 &gt;This is because the recidivism model *can not* predict the outcome of one trial.

*Yes, statistics are not omniscient I don't know why I have to keep repeating this*. The model cannot tell you definitively if someone will reoffend. It can give you the *probability* that they will reoffend, and again you can then go retrospectively look at everyone the model gave a 60% recidivism probability to and verify ""oh wow they reoffend 60% of the time"". 

Let's try another example, how do we verify how well our weather forecasting algorithms work. The weather on one day either is rainy or is sunny or is cloudy. Does this mean that when the weatherman say there is a 60% chance of rain they are just making up a probability with an impossible confidence interval? No! You aggregate the forecasts retrospective and can verify that when the weather guy says there is a 60% chance of rain that it actually does rain 60% of the time.

&gt; But, if I asked you: ""What is the probability that the next coin flip will be Heads,"" the only answer supported by the model is ""I don't know,"" because any prediction based on your model for a single flip would have an infinite confidence interval. 

*Please* tell me you don't teach statistics. If you know the coin is fair, say because you ran a massive trial yesterday, the probability the next flip will be heads is 50%, and the next flip after that will have a 50% chance of being heads and so on. 


&gt;You need more than one coin flip for the model to mean anything.

*No* if you know the underlying pdf you can absolutely make statements about the probability of single independent events.

That's why if I said ""I'll give you $100 if the coin is heads and you give me $10 if its tails"" is a bet you always take even if you only run the bet once. Whereas ""I'll give you $100 if a cat 5 hurricane hits Kansas tomorrow and you give me $10 if it doesnt"" isn't a bet you would take.


&gt; the goal of the legal system isn't just to reduce recidivism

The goal of the legal system varies dramatically depending on your ethical frame, your beliefs about free will, and your framework for what constitutes justice. A determinist consequentialist will give you a different goal than deontologist who believes in libertarian free will. 


&gt; unjustly punishing people who have done nothing wrong.

How is keeping a group of people that we know represent a small risk to society behind bars longer instead of granting them parole not unjustly punishing people?

Everyone in these cases has done something wrong in the eyes of the law. They were convicted of a crime. Whether or not to let them out early on parole or how long to keep them behind bars initially during sentencing will vary, and *it should*. Just because two people are charged with the same crime does not mean they need the same length or type of rehabilitation, or that they present the same danger to the rest of society. Again what you are basically describing is the mandatory minimum laws, and they frequently have terrible consequences that we shouldn't ignore because we care more about some principle than we do the actual effects. 

&gt;support racial profiling and every other kind of profiling based on correlational data

Again I've made it perfectly clear that is a right and wrong way to do this. Stop and frisk is almost certainly the wrong way. Having police patrol the south side of chicago more frequently than whatever the safest part of Chicago is probably a better use of resources than having them just patrol randomly. 

Parole boards need to make decisions and do make decisions about whether or not to grant parole. This is just a true fact of our justice system. Should they just ignore factors indicative of recidivism? No! It's literally their jobs to determine who can be reintegrated into society early and who can't. 


&gt;Do you support higher max. sentences on all black people, just because the correlational data indicates greater recidivism? 

No I don't. Largely because skin color is likely correlated to recidivism via collider effects. 

&gt;How is that different...

No I don't suggest you should give a longer sentence to everyone who is black or unemployed or whatever. I suggest you use the data available along with the other factors that already go into sentencing/parole decisions to make a more informed decision about the appropriate sentence/parole release etc. 


&gt; It doesn't allow you to predict an individuals likelihood of a reoffense, at all. The math is indisputable.

I really strongly hope you don't teach math because you *clearly* don't understand the underlying statistics.

I think that the most likely picture of AGI is going to come from researching the human brain--we've already been able to apply very simple forms of AI to Neuroscience that has enabled us to not only allow people to control robotic limbs with their minds, but even to form pictures, words and sounds from their thoughts. In one experiment, monkeys whose brains were linked up to computers were shown an image that would model a neutral network based on what excited them, and the images ultimately produced the recognizable setting of their laboratory life.

Would love to 'hear' about what you guys consider future applications of AI-voice, concerns, dreams and wants of what this tech could help us do.

Our goal is to create life-like synthetic voices from the voices of real people. And we're seeing early success. We are an early stage AI startup in Seattle. We started as an Artificial Intelligence project at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence ([AI2](https://allenai.org/)). The initial focus to help creatives augment voice productions using AI, but we will be exploring applications in the near future.

We built WSL based on the premise that most TTS services sound too robotic and are not ideal for creative productions. With that in mind, we've created a library of AI voices for creatives to create content in real-time, with human pitch, emphasis, and intonation. Whether it be an audiobook, explainer video, or lecture.

As a core principle, we strongly believe technology should be empowering, engaging, and fair to all people. Through consent and transparency in data usage, we build secure systems that protect user privacy. We strive to hold ourselves accountable for the algorithms we deploy, and we uphold the principles of the Hippocratic Oath.

Now that there is democratization of information, the scales are tilting in favor of creation of resources out of knowledge (and that's innovation) and for this the education system will require recalibration.

69,[],Sirisian,,,[],,,,text,t2_5hqm0,False,,"&gt; I don't necessarily see a robot replacing me and connecting with/motivating my students more effectively than I can

It won't be a robot. What we're likely to see are augmented reality programs. Virtual teachers that can interact with students identically to a regular teacher. As another comment mentioned they'd be able to talk to the student and answer questions.

I've taught briefly as a TA with the same lesson plan and instruction for a few semesters. I'm 100% confident that my job could be replaced. (My background is computer science also).

1. Create a very detailed lesson plan that has been shown to work with students and produces very little questions from the average student.
2. Convert the teacher into a virtual teacher that can instruct the lesson plan displaying the required information in a power point.
3. Give AR glasses and allow students to go through the lesson plan.
4. Allow them to ask questions and build a decision tree of responses that answers their questions.
5. Go to step 2 iterating on the design as much as possible.

Augmented reality should allow for a near 1:1 experience for students at least in the teacher aspect. Depending on the funding the augmented reality programs can incorporate graphics and information in 3D that is easier to convey ideas. For language arts not much will probably change since it's largely literary works and writing. For math, science, and physics classes there's a lot of 3D things that are used.

Long-lasting Analgesia via Targeted in vivo Epigenetic Repression of Nav1.7

Abstract:

Current treatments for chronic pain rely largely on opioids despite their unwanted side effects and risk of addiction. Genetic studies have identified in humans key targets pivotal to nociceptive processing, with the voltage-gated sodium channel, NaV1.7 (SCN9A), being perhaps the most promising candidate for analgesic drug development. Specifically, a hereditary loss-of-function mutation in NaV1.7 leads to insensitivity to pain without other neurodevelopmental alterations. However, the high sequence similarity between NaV subtypes has frustrated efforts to develop selective inhibitors. Here, we investigated targeted epigenetic repression of NaV1.7 via genome engineering approaches based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dCas9 and zinc finger proteins as a potential treatment for chronic pain. Towards this end, we first optimized the efficiency of NaV1.7 repression in vitro in Neuro2A cells, and then by the lumbar intrathecal route delivered both genome-engineering platforms via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to assess their effects in three mouse models of pain: carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain, paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain and BzATP-induced pain. Our results demonstrate: one, effective repression of NaV1.7 in lumbar dorsal root ganglia; two, reduced thermal hyperalgesia in the inflammatory state; three, decreased tactile allodynia in the neuropathic state; and four, no changes in normal motor function. We anticipate this genomically scarless and non-addictive pain amelioration approach enabling Long-lasting Analgesia via Targeted in vivo Epigenetic Repression of Nav1.7, a methodology we dub pain LATER, will have significant therapeutic potential, such as for preemptive administration in anticipation of a pain stimulus (pre-operatively), or during an established chronic pain state.

124,[],solar-cabin,,,[],,,,text,t2_102o0n,False,,""" The complicated politics of the Alaska Permanent Fund

To supporters of a UBI, the Alaska PFD offers a tantalizing glimpse of what a universal basic income can do. Thanks to the PFD, crippling poverty is scant in Alaska. A 2016 study by the University of Alaska found it reduced poverty up to [20 percent](https://iseralaska.org/static/legacy_publication_links/2016_12-PFDandPoverty.pdf).

However, Alaskans’ finances are insecure in other ways. High unemployment ([the highest in the country](https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm)) and the [astronomical cost](https://www.knom.org/wp/blog/2016/04/04/the-cost-of-living-in-alaska/) of rural living meant that even voters who were concerned about the feasibility of Dunleavy’s $6,700 pledge [voted for him anyway](https://www.alaskapublic.org/2018/12/03/pfd-promise-key-to-dunleavys-win-in-hoonah/).

A couple thousand bucks might not sound like basic income, but for many rural Alaskans, [a big PFD can mean the difference](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/alaska-oil-permanent-fund-dividend-universal-basic-income/) between a year of hunger and a year of plenty. In the end, Dunleavy’s $6,700 was an offer too high to refuse.

But on top of all the cuts he’s pushed, Dunleavy agreed on August 20 to the $1,600 PFD that was passed by the legislature — meaning Alaskans *still* won’t get the check they thought they were voting for, because [contrary to Dunleavy’s campaign messaging](https://www.ktva.com/story/39400639/how-much-power-does-a-governor-have-over-the-pfd), the governor does not actually hold the power to set the value of the dividend. (Only the legislature does.)

The upheavals in Alaska illustrate how the PFD has come to warp the state’s politics. It has allowed a feckless politician to capitalize on residents’ economic insecurities and reach the state’s highest office. Alaska is one of the closest test cases we have for UBI, and interested parties should note the political and social costs that Alaska’s PFD is accruing. Once a government adopts such a policy, it may well become the preeminent issue in future campaigns. As Anchorage Daily News commentator Charles Wohlforth [wrote](https://www.adn.com/opinions/national-opinions/2018/11/25/is-alaskas-dividend-a-good-model-for-the-world-probably-not/), “It took only a year or two before the fund became politically sacrosanct.”

Alaska is not a perfect analog to the United States as a whole. The state has no income or sales tax and is loath to implement either. Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend plan relies on [dedicated tax revenue](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/), which would be subject to fewer vicissitudes than oil markets. It is also improbable the US would find itself in a similar budgetary bind that would pit funding for public services against a UBI. The US can borrow in huge numbers and perform financial wizardry that a lone state cannot.

However, Alaska’s political composition means it is a better test case for UBI than any [small-scale randomized controlled trial](https://www.wired.com/story/y-combinator-learns-basic-income-is-not-so-basic-after-all/), since it allows observers to study not only the economic and social ramifications of UBI but also its effects in the political arena. Republicans control the government of Alaska — just as they now control the US federal government — and Republicans tend to defund public services and thwart attempts to raise taxes on the wealthy. Any viable American UBI policy would have to grapple with the same temptations on the part of conservative politicians to use UBI to get elected and then as an excuse to strip public funding from programs they don’t like.

The situation unfolding in Alaska demonstrates how economic precarity, paired with an entrenched reliance on an annual check, can result in [deep political dysfunction](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/452270-alaska-political-mess-has-legislators-divided-over-meeting-place). How might the government salvage this vital yet troublesome program? Alaskan lawmakers have proposed codifying the formula for the dividend check amount in the state constitution as a way of settling its perennial political battles.""

In theory quantum computers can run a statistical calculation and compute all of the outcomes simultaneously instead of one at a time. Obviously this is massive speed up when there are many many outcomes to an algorithm.

A bit is the smallest piece of information a computer can store and manipulate. A bit can be one or zero. Pack 8 bits together and you get a byte. 1024 of those together and you get a kilobyte, 1024 kilobytes is a megabyte and so on and so forth. A qubit can be a one or zero aswell, it can also be any number between one and zero, at the same time. In fact a qubit represents every value from 1-0 but the chance of it being any specific number follows a probability curve and only resolves to an actual number when measures. You can take advantage of that super position by running calculations before it's observed, thus allowing you to traverse a massive amount of calculations simultaneously.

The problem? Qubits are VERY sensitive to the outside world and will spontaneous collapse into regular information if not kept under ideal conditions. A long lived quibit only exists for a few nano seconds. You can see how it would be hard to take advantage of this state when you're trying to get many qubits to interact. Beyond that, because each qubit represents a probability, everything can go perfectly and still give you the wrong answer by pure chance. You need to run operation many times to build up a map of what is the correct answer by measuring what outcome happens the most often.

It doesn't help people spot competent fakes, because it's trivially easy to calculate and distribute a valid checksum for a fake, just as it is for a genuine recording.

A digital signature (which includes a hash of the data) also serves to **identify** the signer (assuming all parts of the system are working as intended). However, verifying the identity of someone who endorsed a recording doesn't necessarily prove that the recording itself is genuine; it just tells you whose story and motivations need to be questioned.

A blockchain record (which effectively includes a digital signature from the uploader, as well as a hash code) accomplishes all of the above, with one additional benefit: it bears witness to the **original upload date** of the data. This **still** does not prove that the recording itself is genuine, but it can prevent people from [changing history](https://www.history.com/news/josef-stalin-great-purge-photo-retouching), a common temptation in politics, courtrooms, and the perverse minds of gaslighters everywhere.

But hypothetically speaking, I dont think this system would be so radically implemented in 2019.

But let's jump ahead to 2060 and say that we have achieved levels of AI and automation by then which are capable of computing things far into the future and accurately predicting needs for humans in ways that render our current economic systems obsolete. People are still needed for certain jobs and they elect to do those jobs based on factors such as how much free time they get off of work. Instead of having one person cleaning 100 toilets, maybe we have 100 people cleaning 1 toilet each. They all get to go home to their guaranteed shelter, decide what food to cook, and spend their time contributing to society in any way they see fit. Perhaps there is still a monetary system but that it is a worldwide currency like cryptocurrency and is also having its value determined by AI so when you purchase something it is a fair exchange that isnt being manipulated by corporations in any way. Maybe you want to upgrade your life, then you educate yourself on a job that is deemed in need by the AI system based on your location in the world. You have accurate and fair information which tells you what is available in real time. We no longer have prejudiced hiring practices or a problem with finding a job and you aren't under threat of death if you fail to find what you want. You may even consider relocating to somewhere else or working from home. 3D printers replace much of transporting goods because you can just print what you need on the fly. 

There is no EXCESS which is the key word here. People live in excess and that is unnecessary. No one human need multiple mansions or to be a landlord. Land is privately owned by the occupant. If you aren't occupying the land then you dont own it. That's greedy and ridiculous. There are too many people on the planet. Everyone will feel like a billionaire regardless of their job or perceived status and value because you'll be able to log into a virtual reality world that seems just as real as our real world. You'll be able to jetski for example and ride fast cars and fly and sky dive etc... all without actually physically doing them. The virtual is going to make things a lot better for people. 

This is all hypothetical maybe this happens in 1000 years from now. I do not know. But I do know that it is possible and will eventually happen. Basically the matrix. 

What is the need for all of this excessive physical space and ownership of physical things? They dont bring anymore happiness than electronic and virtual things do. And as the virtual becomes more and more indiscernible from the real, people will be content to be virtual billionaires so to speak. 

And of course there will still be physical interactions and fitness etc.. but for peoples desire to live lavishly, much of that will be done on a virtual basis, I am predicting.

I hope that makes sense?

What will peoples incentive be? Well at this point there wont be a need for you to be a CEO of a company that is producing X or Y because much of it will (much like how Microsoft dominated computers) be provided by a few companies which you cannot hope to compete against. They will swallow up small business and big business alike. This is where capitalism succeeded... it has created the path for a future that is full of amazing possibilities. But it has also become obsolete in that future. We dont need to keep competing because we reach a level of contentment and technological advancement that none of that is necessary anymore. A sort of eureka moment.

So the incentive will be that there wont need to be incentive because everyone will have everything they need. People will work as doctors for the same reason people join the military today. Selfless service and a desire to help and be a part of something. Dont underestimate peoples goodness. Not everyone wants to be lazy even if they can.

Google doesn't post its percentages of how accurate it is to the public but it is a open source program right now so the range reported is between 0% and 50% accurate with nothing linking it to a database of relationships of others.

The police does not need to be profitable. That is not what they exist.  
  
&gt; a police presence often does little more than increase the crime rate/ increase the amount of convictions in the area.  
  
But we are not talking about police presence. We are talking about technology presence.  
Police is flaws in how they approach. Someone robs you, you give description, they need to find him, they need to prove that is indeed him, and he ends up getting released on some technicality.  
With technology most of this is gone. He is marked, you know who he is, and technology will allow you to find him. There is no ""maybe its him"" and no ""I have witness that claims I was in another place"" etc.  
  
&gt; When I needed help, I went to a social worker  
  
When I need medical assistance, I don't go to the police as well. But we are talking about criminal problem, not ""I have an itch in my left leg, I better call the police to shoot the mosquito"". Seriously....  
When someone is robbing you, you don't go to a social worker. He won't help you.  
  
&gt; but I believe that their jobs, first and foremost, are to protect the interests of capital, to protect private property.  
  
That is not in their job description. Even if they might act like that, that is not their job. Their job is to protect people and their belongings. Just like you expect them to protect your home if someone is trying to rob it, why shouldn't they also protect some business building from someone trying to rob or vandalise it?  
  
&gt; a lot of the data they collect and work with comes directly from patrol officers, which means that there’s a bias  
  
You are talking about 2nd hand data. We are not talking about that. What a witness says becomes irrelevant when a camera can capture the event. ""He punched me really hard!"" when an actual recording shows it was barely a slap,  that is where technology comes into play.  
  
&gt; what happens when facial recognition is used to create a database of protesters who disagree with the current administration  
  
That is why it needs to not be misused, but technology exist. Just like your car. You can use your car to drive from point A to point B, or you can use it to run people over. It doesn't mean we should ban all cars because the latter is possible (and has been used).  
  
&gt; What happens when they sell the data they collected?  
  
The police sell the data? I expect there will be laws against such an action.  
And just fyi, people are using those face swap apps freely. They are giving their data away for free to sell anyway.  
  
&gt; but they’re possible, and possibilities like this deserve, no, need to be discussed, ideally by the people regulating it, implementing it, so we know they have a modicum of self awareness.

Banning something preemptively is simply foolish. Sacrificing gains out of fear of the unknown is a crippling personality trait. And it's not usually something we put up with.

The real way we deal with risks is to find out what they are by DOING it. Facial recognition is not going to spread across the country overnight. This is all processes. It will *inherently* start small and we can figure out what the dangers are and protect against them. A ban is absurd.

It's simply a tool. If you get caught on camera then, just like with finger prints and DNA samples, they run it against a database to see who it was that did a thing. 

The UK is using it in real time to flag them for perceived threats for monitoring. So that is an additional benefit.

Filming public areas isn't the same as obtaining knowledge about everyone all the time. It generally falls into two categories. AI warns people if someone in an area now matches a wanted criminal or terrorist (how the UK uses it), or, if a crime was committed and you have video of it then you can run that image across a database.

Summary

Background

Deep learning offers considerable promise for medical diagnostics. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning algorithms versus health-care professionals in classifying diseases using medical imaging.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Ovid-MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index for studies published from Jan 1, 2012, to June 6, 2019. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals based on medical imaging, for any disease, were included. We excluded studies that used medical waveform data graphics material or investigated the accuracy of image segmentation rather than disease classification. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. Studies undertaking an out-of-sample external validation were included in a meta-analysis, using a unified hierarchical model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018091176.

Findings

Our search identified 31 587 studies, of which 82 (describing 147 patient cohorts) were included. 69 studies provided enough data to construct contingency tables, enabling calculation of test accuracy, with sensitivity ranging from 9·7% to 100·0% (mean 79·1%, SD 0·2) and specificity ranging from 38·9% to 100·0% (mean 88·3%, SD 0·1). An out-of-sample external validation was done in 25 studies, of which 14 made the comparison between deep learning models and health-care professionals in the same sample. Comparison of the performance between health-care professionals in these 14 studies, when restricting the analysis to the contingency table for each study reporting the highest accuracy, found a pooled sensitivity of 87·0% (95% CI 83·0–90·2) for deep learning models and 86·4% (79·9–91·0) for health-care professionals, and a pooled specificity of 92·5% (95% CI 85·1–96·4) for deep learning models and 90·5% (80·6–95·7) for health-care professionals.

Interpretation

Our review found the diagnostic performance of deep learning models to be equivalent to that of health-care professionals. However, a major finding of the review is that few studies presented externally validated results or compared the performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals using the same sample. Additionally, poor reporting is prevalent in deep learning studies, which limits reliable interpretation of the reported diagnostic accuracy. New reporting standards that address specific challenges of deep learning could improve future studies, enabling greater confidence in the results of future evaluations of this promising technology.",1569409437,{},f1e1h10,True,t3_d91kop,False,True,t3_d91kop,/r/technology/comments/d91kop/ai_equal_with_human_experts_in_medical_diagnosis/f1e1h10/,1569409446.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of a quantum computer, there are very few ""problems"" that they know how to create hardware to solve that end up being faster that current classical computing algorithms on current hardware.  I suppose this is technically the first, which is why it is so important.  Now that the first is found, we know it is possible, it was all theory before now (most likely, time will tell if there is a classical algorithm that could be faster, it seems pretty likely there is not).

GPU's are basically massively parallel computation on vectors, and TPU's are units of hardware specifically designed for machine learning.

&gt; September 20, 2019
&gt; Google claims to have built the first quantum computer that can carry out calculations beyond the ability of today’s most powerful supercomputers, a landmark moment that has been hotly anticipated by researchers.
&gt; 
&gt; A paper by Google’s researchers seen by the FT, that was briefly posted earlier this week on a Nasa website before being removed, claimed that their processor was able to perform a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds that would take today’s most advanced classical computer, known as Summit, approximately 10,000 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The researchers said this meant the “quantum supremacy”, when quantum computers carry out calculations that had previously been impossible, had been achieved.
&gt; 
&gt; “This dramatic speed-up relative to all known classical algorithms provides an experimental realisation of quantum supremacy on a computational task and heralds the advent of a much-anticipated computing paradigm,” the authors wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; “To our knowledge, this experiment marks the first computation that can only be performed on a quantum processor.”
&gt; 
&gt; The system can only perform a single, highly technical calculation, according to the researchers, and the use of quantum machines to solve practical problems is still years away.
&gt; 
&gt; But the Google researchers called it “a milestone towards full-scale quantum computing”. They also predicted that the power of quantum machines would expand at a “double exponential rate”, compared to the exponential rate of Moore’s Law, which has driven advances in silicon chips in the first era of computing.
&gt; 
&gt; While prototypes of so-called quantum computers do exist, developed by companies ranging from IBM to start-ups such as Rigetti Computing, they can only perform the same tasks classical computers can, albeit quicker.
&gt; 
&gt; Quantum computers, if they can be built at scale, will harness properties that extend beyond the limits of classical physics to offer exponential gains in computing power.
&gt; 
&gt; A November 2018 report by the Boston Consulting Group said they could “change the game in such fields as cryptography and chemistry (and thus material science, agriculture and pharmaceuticals) not to mention artificial intelligence and machine learning . . . logistics, manufacturing, finance and energy”.
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike the basic binary elements of classical computers, or bits, which represent either zeros or ones, quantum bits, or qubits, can represent both at the same time. By stringing together qubits, the number of states they could represent rises exponentially, making it possible to compute millions of possibilities instantly.
&gt; 
&gt; Some researchers have warned against overhyping the quantum supremacy, arguing that it does not suggest that quantum machines will quickly overtake traditional computers and bring a revolution in computing.
&gt; 
&gt; Led by John Martinis, an experimental physicist from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Google first predicted it would reach quantum supremacy by the end of 2017. But the system it built, linking together 72 qubits proved too difficult to control.
&gt; 
&gt; It eventually revamped the system to create a 53-qubit design it codenamed Sycamore. The system was given the task of proving that a random-number generator was truly random. Though that job has little practical application, the Google researchers said that “other initial uses for this computational capability” included machine learning, materials science and chemistry.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s a significant milestone, and the first time that somebody has shown that quantum computers could outperform classical computers at all,” said Steve Brierley, founder of quantum software start-up Riverlane, who has worked in the field for 20 years and is an adviser on quantum technologies to the UK government. “It’s an amazing achievement.”
&gt;

Adam Neumann was flying high. Literally.

His office-rental giant WeWork was months away from being valued at $47 billion. Revenue was doubling annually. And Mr. Neumann was zipping across the Atlantic Ocean in a Gulfstream G650 private jet with friends last summer, smoking marijuana.

After the group landed in Israel and left the plane, the flight crew found a sizable chunk of the drug stuffed in a cereal box for the return flight, according to people familiar with the incident. The jet’s owner, upset and fearing repercussions of trans-border marijuana transport, recalled the plane, leaving Mr. Neumann to find his own way back to New York, these people said.

Since Mr. Neumann co-founded WeWork—recently renamed We Co.—with Miguel McKelvey nine years ago, he has led with unusual exuberance and excess. His combination of entrepreneurial vision, personal charisma and brash risk-taking helped the company surpass $2 billion in annual revenue, and made it the country’s most valuable startup.

Now many of the same qualities that helped fuel his company’s breakneck growth in the private market are piling up as potential liabilities as the company prepares to go public—helmed by a CEO who looks little like a typical public-company chief.

Mr. Neumann muses about the implausible: becoming leader of the world, living forever, amassing more than $1 trillion in wealth. Partying has long been a feature of his work life, heavy on the tequila.

Public investors are increasingly skeptical of the formula that has worked for Mr. Neumann so far: his pitch that We is far more than a real-estate company. With its rapid growth and use of technology, he argued, the company deserves rich valuations normally reserved for tech companies.

Instead, many potential investors now see a fast-growing office subleasing company with losses of more than $1.6 billion last year.

Since We filed the prospectus for its initial public offering last month, it has been besieged with criticism over its governance, business model and ability to turn a profit. It is now expecting an IPO valuation as low as a third of the $47 billion sticker price it garnered in a January funding round—a drop without recent precedent. This week, We postponed the offering until October at the earliest.

Wall Street and Silicon Valley investors have been dismayed by the number of potential conflicts of interest disclosed in the “S-1” IPO prospectus, including Mr. Neumann leasing properties he owns back to the company and borrowing heavily against his stock. Even some of We’s private investors said they were angered to learn that an entity Mr. Neumann controls sold the rights to the word “We” to the company for almost $6 million—before public pressure led him to unwind the deal.

“This is not the way everybody behaves,” said Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter Inc., who led the company through one of the larger tech IPOs of the past decade. “The degree of self-dealing in the S-1 is so egregious, and it comes at a time when you’ve got regulators and politicians and folks across the country looking out at Silicon Valley and wondering if there’s the appropriate level of self-awareness.”

Given the prominence of the IPO, he added, “that is a big problem.”

Mr. Neumann, 40, declined to comment through a spokesman, who cited rules surrounding the planned IPO. Mr. Neumann told We employees Tuesday the process had been humbling and he would learn from it, say people who heard him. We executives have previously said he is strongly devoted to the company, and many of his personal transactions were made with the company’s best interests at heart.

This account is based on interviews with current and former employees, investors and friends who interacted with Mr. Neumann as he built We.

For startup investors, the 6-foot-5 Mr. Neumann has always had the qualities they crave in Silicon Valley founders, despite being based in New York. He is intensely ambitious and a masterful storyteller with a magnetic personality who can inspire and sell.

Raised in Israel on a kibbutz, Mr. Neumann moved to the U.S. when he was 22, where he attended Baruch College and tried to start businesses. One was a collapsible heel on women’s shoes that didn’t get off the ground. Working out of his Tribeca apartment, he started Krawlers, which sought to make baby clothes with knee pads to make crawling more comfortable. The slogan, he has said: “Just because they don’t tell you, doesn’t mean they don’t hurt.” It never gained traction.

He and Mr. McKelvey started a small co-working space on the side during the recession that followed the financial crisis and were amazed by the demand.


By 2010, they had started WeWork, with essentially the same core business model that exists today: They lease an office long-term, renovate it to make it hip and inviting, and sublease smaller desks and offices short-term.

Early on, Mr. Neumann painted a picture of how WeWork was connecting entrepreneurs and others who in the past would have worked from home or in coffee shops; how the company would bring a new way of working to a changing world.

The founders planned for the “We” brand to expand beyond office space into other categories such as housing and finance. Mr. Neumann ramped up its image as a tech company as it grew.

It introduced a mobile app for network members, meant to facilitate a “physical social network.” The company emphasized its data and how it was using artificial intelligence to glean insights about buildings.

Past funders and employees tell stories of how an animated Mr. Neumann convinced them within minutes to believe in the company’s epic future.

“When I met him, after a couple of minutes, I wanted to invest,” said Joey Low, whose Star Farm Ventures put money into the company in 2013 and multiple subsequent funding rounds. “He was hungry for success—that was for sure.”

Even former executives who disliked Mr. Neumann give him credit for an extraordinary ability to motivate employees and push the company.

He forgoes many conventions of the standard, buttoned-up CEO. He pushed for rowdy parties in the early days. He often walks barefoot around the office. In an earlier office, he blared songs by pop-star Rihanna while a trainer held a punching bag for him, and then walked around afterward while still sweaty from the exertion.

Like some high-profile CEOs in tech, he hopes to live forever, according to three people who heard him say this, and has invested in life-extension startup Life Biosciences LLC.

It says its mission is “to create a future where age-related decline is not a fact of life.”

As WeWork grew, Mr. Neumann took on ever more investment, bringing in tens of millions of dollars from venture capitalists, then hundreds of millions from mutual funds T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Investments. Crucially, he secured full control of the company in 2014 when investor demand was high—getting shares with 10 times the votes of others.

Ultimately he found a kindred spirit in Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank Group Corp., who, like Mr. Neumann, is a risk-taker who respects giant bets. Mr. Son, a telecom veteran who raised the world’s largest tech fund in 2017, met Mr. Neumann in India in 2016 and pondered an investment.

SoftBank first committed $3.1 billion in new funding in 2017. Mr. Neumann has told others that Mr. Son appreciated how he was crazy—but thought that he needed to be crazier. A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment.

Many former employees said they didn’t always know how seriously to take some of Mr. Neumann’s pronouncements. Early on, he would throw out seemingly random ideas, like adding a pool in the basement of the company’s headquarters or starting an airline.

He told at least one person directly that his ambitions included becoming Israel’s prime minister. More recently, he said that if he ran for anything, it would be president of the world, according to another person who spoke with him.",1568865458,{},f0qsczh,False,t3_d615te,False,True,t3_d615te,/r/technology/comments/d615te/this_is_not_the_way_everybody_behaves_how_adam/f0qsczh/,1568865468.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A company refusing a military contract isn't ""imposing their moral framework on America"". The government is providing an offer of work for pay, and the company is saying that the work isn't worth the baggage. Google isn't blocking any other company from taking the work.

&gt;Companies and innovators in Silicon Valley have immense, almost monopolistic power. Many have lucrative contracts with the government. But under scrutiny from employees and activists, they are being pressured to avoid controversy by picking and choosing which contracts to accept and which to abandon. Giving in to this pressure will have the perverse effect of undermining the democratic principles that Silicon Valley leaders and activists pressuring them profess to support.

What kind of 1984 double speak is this? A company listening to public and employee pressure is subverting democratic principles? Companies shouldn't be allowed to ""pick and choose"" contracts? What?

&gt;Let me be brutally clear about this: The young people who volunteer for the Marines and get deployed overseas might not agree with every mission, but you can be sure they are doing their jobs. Google earned millions of dollars working on Project Maven, an artificial-intelligence and machine-learning effort funded by the Defense Department with the potential to improve the military’s drone accuracy and capabilities. Some of the company’s workers objected — no problem there. But then Google executives backed away from the mission. The U.S. Marine serves; the Silicon Valley executives walk. This is wrong.

A) The Marine signed a contract forcing them to do damn near whatever the fuck Uncle Sam tells them to do for years. And once all terms of that contract are up, no individual marine is forced to reenlist and serve more time.

B) Google signed a contract, then fulfilled that contract, then refused a new contract. Seems pretty straightforward.

&gt;I am deeply sympathetic to the people who are concerned about the use of software platforms in immigration policy. Every week or so, a small group of them holds a rally outside our office. What is worrisome is not their protests. What is worrisome is that some Silicon Valley companies are taking the power to decide these issues away from elected officials and judges and giving it to themselves — a deeply unrepresentative group of executives living in an elite bubble in a corner of the country. They weigh their beliefs along with their complex business interests, both domestically and globally, and then make decisions that impact the safety and security of our country. This is not the way consequential policy decisions should be made. I don’t believe I should have that authority.

That's nice and all, but no one can or should be forced to do work for the government in the way you seem to want. Refusing to actively work with or for the government isn't ""making policy"". What's the line of logic here? That Google should be *forced* to take these contracts? And what if no one at Google wants to work on those contracts? Should people be put on the project against their will? Can they be prevented from quitting? Whether or not a decision by Google to bid for a certain contract affects the ""safety and security of our country"" is irrelevant. It is just generally wrong to try and commandeer the labor of particular people to serve government ends. The government is free to find other, *willing* people.

&gt;No company should have to work for the government. The challenge is when they want to accept lucrative law enforcement or military contracts with one hand while stiff-arming the government with the other. Under those circumstances, a supposed moral stand is tainted by self-interest.

If the government wants to try to implement something into it's contracts that ""once you accept a contract you must accept any further contracts the government offers in perpetuity"", then I guess it can try, but it's not going to get any bidders. Even the straight up military industry companies aren't going to accept that contract, because they'll pass up contracts all the time if they don't think the work will be profitable for them.

&gt;And no leader should knowingly permit his or her products to be used illegally. That requires taking a stand. Indeed, there are immense regulatory and policy challenges we need to grapple with as a society, including how to manage the explosive growth of artificial intelligence and facial-recognition technology.

&gt;But let’s reframe the controversy over immigration and look at it this way: If we want to preserve a democracy in which protests are part of our DNA, we need to make sure the decisions are made by elected representatives and judges, not by unelected engineers running global businesses in a precious corner of a Golden State.

I can't tell if this guy is legitimately confused or is trying to deliberately obfuscate what he's saying to confuse people. His concepts veer between nonsensical, contradictory, and ludicrously underdeveloped. His entire point seems to be ""Hey Google! Your government has asked you to do something. Now do it, no questions asked. And pick up that can."". I'd hate to read into it too far, but there's something vaguely (or maybe not so vaguely) fascistic about this mindset. Applied to large corporations it's pretty scary, but how far down does it go?

Lifi is especially interesting for high-speed communication at short distances. An obvious application is the creation of a home or business network where computers and laptops are connected to the network and internet via the lighting in rooms or offices. For that, dongles are still needed, but companies such as pure LiFi envision a future in which lifitransceivers become a standard part, just like a wifi chip and antenna that are now in many devices. All kinds of electronic equipment in the house could then be connected to lifi, from computers, smartphones and tablets to TVs and refrigerators.
Due to the high transfer rates that are possible, lifi is also interesting for wirelessly connecting virtual reality and augmented reality glasses to computers. It is currently possible to connect some vr headsets wirelessly; current solutions use the 802.11ad protocol, also known as WiGig, which operates at a frequency of 60GHz. That wifi variant is suitable for data transfer over short distances, something in which lifi is also strong. There are currently no vr glasses that work with lifi, but it could well be that manufacturers are already working on this behind the scenes. PureLiFi specifically mentions this as a market in which lifi must offer a solution. That company also sees lifi as a way for mutual communication between cars. In many cases, cars already have LED lights, so the infrastructure is already largely present.
There has been a concrete interest in lifi from the aviation industry for years and that is not surprising. Interference is a problem with wireless connections in aircraft and lifi offers no risk in that regard. According to aircraft builders, the use of lifi also saves weight because less cabling is required. There are currently no airplanes in the air that actually use lifi, but several companies and companies are experimenting with it and have shown demonstrations.
PureLiFi, for example, works together with Astronics, a supplier of aircraft interiors. That company showed a lifi connection at an exhibition in April based on infrared light at a speed of 60 Mbit / s, which is sufficient to stream 4k videos. In aircraft, for example, lifi can be incorporated into the reading light above seats. By using infrared, the connection also works without providing visible light. According to Astronics, the technology is mature and it is only a matter of time before lifi come to planes.",1568800238,{},f0o7qmd,True,t3_d5vaul,False,True,t1_f0o7p28,/r/technology/comments/d5vaul/lifi_is_coming/f0o7qmd/,1568800238.0,1,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that you seem to think science is some kind of ideology with a platform, or maybe a committee that just says ""yeah this is legit"" tells me that you don't know what science is. Science is a process of verification and falsification of hypotheses. Science is an APPROACH to determining if something is true, and the transgender acceptance issue does not use it, it completely sidesteps it, putting personal opinions above provable hypotheses. For transgenderism to be scientifically accepted in the form in which it is presented in pop culture (That is, a transgender woman is actually completely a woman), you'd have to prove that they become functionally, biological women. Capable of getting pregnant, capable of lactation, etc. That has never happened and it never will happen absent genetic engineering, because changing your self-image, changing your mental state and identity, does not physically change your DNA, your chromosome layout. This is completely settled science. Without genetic modification, a man cannot completely become a woman, they can only mimic certain qualities at the cost of deadening other biological processes of the male body, such as sperm production and virility.

I discovered something neat about 3 or 4 years ago: many of these things, if not most, are impossible without advancements in AI. Not necessarily general AI, but AI nonetheless. You need an agent to parse and piece data, find patterns, and generate solutions in order to progress sci-tech. Humans only have so many hours in the day and often miss big breakthroughs by chance. What's more, you can't use human brainpower to run some things. 

Take flying cars. We absolutely NEVER had the technology to make flying cars a *practical* reality because people kept overlooking the one biggest flaw: who pilots the damn thing. We can barely pilot ground-based cars without killing ourselves to the tune of 1.25+ million a year worldwide. That's basically the Jewish Holocaust every 5 years, all dying in car accidents.  And I repeat, that's *2D* motion. Add a third dimension and you might see almost every single driver dead within a year. The *only* way flying cars can work is with self-driving technology. 

We've theorized self-driving cars for about a century, going back to the 1920s. Pop-sci magazines have been heralding the autonomous vehicle's imminent dominance ever since the 1950s— if my grandpa was a geek, he would have read articles talking about the latest progress in AVs when he was a kid. So why are we only now seeing tangible results within the past 5 years? 

Because AI is finally— ***finally***— good enough to consistently recognize objects and latent 3D space. I can't overstate how hard of a problem this historically was for computers other than to point out that, just 15 years ago in 2004, there was a DARPA-run competition for driverless cars to traverse a relatively short course... and they all failed. Every single one. Nowadays, you can actually *buy* Level 3-tier driverless cars from a multitude of companies (I think Audi was the first to offer it, and that was last year). Plus there are decent fully-driverless cars being actively tested and carrying some passengers as we speak. 

So is it any wonder that flying cars have suddenly come back in the form of passenger drones? There will be drone taxi services in the very near future in Dubai, IIRC.

Similar thing with genetic engineering. We couldn't even begin to decode the human genome without faster computers to crunch data— in the 1990s, we thought it would take a thousand years to do it because that's genuinely how long it would have taken with computers of the time. Then we first decoded the human genome in 2003 and have more completely decoded it in the years after. We're able to find specific genes and even play around with them. We're able to predict what will happen if you alter certain genes. And just last year, DeepMind completely *obliterated* a record for predicting protein folding using their own AI. There's no surprise to me that we got our first ""designer babies"" born last year in China after decades of treating the concept as something for the far off future. 

Jetpacks, too— stabilization and fuel usage is going to require AI to handle. It will be more like controlling a video game character than flying because only *the* most skilled people would be able to fly one without burning their asses and crashing into the ground. 

Bionic implants: AI. Without AI to figure these things out and to enhance neural signals to make them useful, it might take 50 years for brain-controlled bionic implants to become a thing. Instead, we're doing it *right now*. 

Perfect health: It's mostly going to be a privacy issue going forward, but AI can monitor your entire body at a level far beyond that of doctors, 24/7, and then perhaps synthesize entirely new drugs (and this isn't even mentioning the possibility of molecular nanotechnology). 

Even VR: very useful to have body-tracking, raytracing, foveated rendering, and more, isn't it? Well the technology wasn't really there before this decade to make it very useful.

Need I repeat: we don't need general AI for any of this. Oh, it would certainly help, but sufficiently strong narrow AI is good enough.

So ***TLDR*** It wasn't all lies; it was just assuming we could do all these things *without* AI in times when computers and AI were exponentially weaker.",1561673476,{},es7ldmr,False,t3_c63ya4,False,True,t1_es6025g,/r/technology/comments/c63ya4/new_ai_deepfake_app_creates_nude_images_of_women/es7ldmr/,1561673478.0,1,True,,False,technology,t5_2qh16,0.0,,1561759875.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because we know what it can do, we know it causes cancer, we know it's addictive. And the boxes have warning labels.

He is lying when he says ""probably won't do anything at all"". It probably won't do anything impressive, but it will probably [cause cancer](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/crispr-edited-cells-linked-to-cancer-risk-in-2-studies/). Oh wait, no warning about that and no knowledge. To be honest we're not even sure.

It is dangerous pseudoscience. He's grabbing a current theory *extrapolating it* and then *assuming it works without due diligence or peer reviewed verification*. He's claiming he's doing science, but really he's just fucking around and having fun. Not that it's bad, a lot of great discoveries come out that way. Science is a discipline and a way of going about things before saying any statement. No self-respecting scientist would put themselves on the public line saying ""this probably won't do anything but here it is"" because if its proven wrong they'd be shamed.

And again we need to know what effects things have before we use it. That's the whole point of the FDA. The system has failed before, and allowed painkillers that were not being honest about how addictive they were. Now we have a massive opiod cvri

There was a time where an untrained guy would go around offering lobotomies to anyone who'd take it. He based himself on theory but abused it and caused permanent damage to many people. Now we agree that the problem was that he did not do enough research or arguments to back his claims, and should not have been allowed to offer lobotomies, or teach how to do them.

Sure it's fun hacking, it may even be good biotech engineering, but it's not science if he doesn't *prove* why. And this is important in understanding what works and what doesn't, and not allowing this distinction is why people think vaccines don't work: after all they look just like the other sham.

&gt; There is a whole swirl of misinformation and mischaracterizations of Zayner that he admitted doesn't spend the time he should directly refuting

Generally when they don't is because they can't. As seen here it has legal implications so it's in his interest, and his lawyer's to directly refute them.

&gt; he isn't the crackpot you think he is

I don't think he's a crackpot, but I think he's being irresponsible and is pushing certain things because he can make money of it. Again if he didn't sell the kits, if he didn't make money of it, it wouldn't be a problem what he claims he can do. OTOH if he sold the product as is, with a description of what it is, but didn't show that it can be used on humans or anything like that, it would be fine too.

&gt; Tons of people have bought his plasmids and kits, but no one has just injected this shit straight into their blood because they all know that isn't actually the point.

I mean he has injected some stuff. What makes you think no one else has? Have you gone through everyone? Can you prove that a person injecting this, after seeing the youtube videos of the creator injecting himself, would know they are doing something ""wrong""?

&gt; The point is to provide DNA that could actually work so people can play with it and improve it, and maybe someday it will become an actual cure to something.

Yes, but there's ethics on how to do this, and why and how. I'd be horrified if someone injected this on children, or on themselves and then had children with genetic defects. What if someone gives it to a diabetic claiming it will fix them, but it ends up giving them cancer? The product should make it clear, in every level, by everyone involved in its creation that it shouldn't be used on humans and is high risk. That you might as well inject yourself with any random glowing puddle ""just to see"". And anyone who claims that it can be used on humans should be responsible for any misused inspired by that.

&gt; Even the FDA is just responding to complaints leveled by people who are just squeamish about this kind of thing.

Hardly. There's a validity to the case. And it probably will push through.

&gt; I doubt they actually care enough to get embroiled in a whole lawsuit over a case they would most certainly lose.

Again hardly.

IMHO it's kind of sad. There's a guy who's willing to take risks and explore an area that otherwise would be very hard to experiment with. He's shown that he understands the risks and realized that others are being reckless by using his actions as justification that ""it's fine"". He did it understanding the risk, not everyone is.

He was passionate about it and explored the whole thing. He realized he could make money by making a business of this, by making these tools he used more accessible to others. His passion blinded him to the risks he was pushing, and he did not realize that many of his fans and buyers may not understand CRISPR tech as well as he does.

He should have kept human-editing hard, and focused on helping people learn and experiment with CRISPR but not with humans.

Making healthcare effectively free for everybody WOULD be cutting their pay. There is literally no getting around this. It is a necessary consequence no matter how much you want to say it isn't. 

Not only will their pay be cut because there's less money going into the healthcare system (private insurance companies pay much more than the government would be willing to pay), but they'd be paying a higher tax percentage too.

This means I give you (or everybody in the world) one key (the public key), while I keep another key secret (the secret key).  You can use the public key to encrypt a message, and then I use the private key to decrypt the message.  For that system to work, there has to be a very specific mathematical relationship between the public key and the private key.  Well, if everybody has the public key, you want to make sure they can’t use that mathematical relationship to figure out the private key, otherwise they can decrypt all your messages.

Standard encryption uses relationships that are relatively easy to pick a private key and generate a corresponding public key, but “very hard” to calculate in the other direction.  We’re talking “it would take billions of years for a classical computer to get from the public key back to the private key” type relationships.

There are a few well-know relationships having those properties: e.g., factorization, discrete logarithms, and elliptic curves.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), it seems quantum computers are particularly good at solving those types of relationships.  So any public key system using those relationships would be vulnerable to attack by a quantum computer.

Cryptocurrencies (and blockchains in general) use a different cryptographic technology known as a cryptographic hash.  These problems take an input and “scramble” it in a specific way so that it’s “very hard” to calculate the original input (but if somebody gave you that input again, you could scramble it and verify the scrambled outputs matched).  As you may intuit, without the need for a matching public / private key pair, there are significantly fewer constraints on what the scrambling algorithm can do.  Most of the widely used hashing (i.e., scrambling) algorithms use entirely different mathematics from public key systems, and those mathematics do not appear to be nearly so vulnerable to quantum computing.

Did you listen to the audio or watch the recording? These things are hyperrealistic.

It is constantly improving and learning, too, so at some point simpler deepfakes will be virtually indistinguishable.

&gt; That's exactly what the Jordan Peterson thing is, anyone reasonable enough knows he'd never say that. All you gotta do is listen to what he says and it doesn't line up with his world view in the slightest.

That doesn't make sense. You're not Jordan Peterson. You don't know Jordan Peterson. There are plenty of closeted racist people that will only suddenly come out and feel emboldened to take a racist stance. See: The eventual aftermath of the 2016 US presidential campaign.

A great example is Donald Sterling. Do you know him? He's a billionaire that used to own the LA Clippers. No one in the public knew he was racist until he got angry at his mistress for associating with black people. Now, you don't know Sterling that well (or, more accurately, you ""know"" him) so your defense would have made him innocent before that audio leaked according to your logic. According to your logic, before Pewdiepie let the hard-r slip on live-stream, and you could have said ""it doesn't line up with his world view in the slightest.""

* Non engineers tend to treat algorithms and machines as objective and mistake-free.  A tool that has better success rates than humans but goes off the rails when mistaken but is treated as absolute and above skepticism could easily lead to worse outcomes.
  * On a related note, Real Life tends to have a lot of tail cases that naturally won't have much training data.  If you are doing machine translation or whatever you can write them off, but for medical diagnosis it needs to intelligently handle them.
* To truly be useful to humans, the tool would need to not just diagnosis x-rays but report why it came up with what it did.  A fundamental weakness of machine learning that I don't think is going to be rescued by deep reasoning or whatever anytime soon.

Summary

Background

Deep learning offers considerable promise for medical diagnostics. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning algorithms versus health-care professionals in classifying diseases using medical imaging.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Ovid-MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index for studies published from Jan 1, 2012, to June 6, 2019. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals based on medical imaging, for any disease, were included. We excluded studies that used medical waveform data graphics material or investigated the accuracy of image segmentation rather than disease classification. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. Studies undertaking an out-of-sample external validation were included in a meta-analysis, using a unified hierarchical model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018091176.

Findings

Our search identified 31 587 studies, of which 82 (describing 147 patient cohorts) were included. 69 studies provided enough data to construct contingency tables, enabling calculation of test accuracy, with sensitivity ranging from 9·7% to 100·0% (mean 79·1%, SD 0·2) and specificity ranging from 38·9% to 100·0% (mean 88·3%, SD 0·1). An out-of-sample external validation was done in 25 studies, of which 14 made the comparison between deep learning models and health-care professionals in the same sample. Comparison of the performance between health-care professionals in these 14 studies, when restricting the analysis to the contingency table for each study reporting the highest accuracy, found a pooled sensitivity of 87·0% (95% CI 83·0–90·2) for deep learning models and 86·4% (79·9–91·0) for health-care professionals, and a pooled specificity of 92·5% (95% CI 85·1–96·4) for deep learning models and 90·5% (80·6–95·7) for health-care professionals.

Interpretation

Our review found the diagnostic performance of deep learning models to be equivalent to that of health-care professionals. However, a major finding of the review is that few studies presented externally validated results or compared the performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals using the same sample. Additionally, poor reporting is prevalent in deep learning studies, which limits reliable interpretation of the reported diagnostic accuracy. New reporting standards that address specific challenges of deep learning could improve future studies, enabling greater confidence in the results of future evaluations of this promising technology.",1569409393,{},f1e1fjn,True,t3_d91niz,False,True,t3_d91niz,/r/science/comments/d91niz/ai_equal_with_human_experts_in_medical_diagnosis/f1e1fjn/,1569409403.0,1,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; Really, the pattern (of readiness potential) would simply reflect how various factors had happened to coincide.

Basically, the consideration of when. ""Now? Now? Now? Now? Now!"" So all of these spikes aren't the decision itself.

In Libet's experiment

&gt; To decide when to tap their fingers, the participants simply acted whenever the moment struck them. Those spontaneous moments, Schurger reasoned, must have coincided with the haphazard ebb and flow of the participants’ brain activity (""readiness potential""). **They would have been more likely to tap their fingers when their motor system happened to be closer to a threshold for movement initiation.**

&gt; In a new study under review for publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Schurger and two Princeton researchers repeated a version of Libet’s experiment. To avoid unintentionally cherry-picking brain noise, they included a control condition in which people didn’t move at all. An artificial-intelligence classifier allowed them to find at what point brain activity in the two conditions diverged. If Libet was right, that should have happened at 500 milliseconds before the movement. But the algorithm couldn’t tell any difference until about only 150 milliseconds before the movement, the time people reported making decisions in Libet’s original experiment.

&gt; **In other words, people’s subjective experience of a decision—what Libet’s study seemed to suggest was just an illusion—appeared to match the actual moment their brains showed them making a decision.**

There's still a lot more work to be done, but this claims that decisions are made at the moment we are conscious of them, 150 ms before the action. 

Ultimately, whether a decision is made before we are conscious of it is also irrelevant to the validity of free will. If they want to prove free will, they would need to show how input into the entire neural structure at a specific state can result in anything other than one outcome, which they won't do. Free will is an unsubstantiated myth.",1568164548,{},ezv0t9x,False,t3_d2al59,False,True,t1_ezutbao,/r/science/comments/d2al59/a_famous_argument_against_free_will_has_been/ezv0t9x/,1568164562.0,1,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the journal First Monday, research by Ferrara and colleagues Luca Luceri (Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana), Ashok Deb (USC ISI), Silvia Giordano (Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana), examine bot behavior during the US 2018 elections compared to bot behavior during the US 2016 elections.

The researchers studied almost 250,000 social media active users who discussed the US elections both in 2016 and 2018, and detected over 30,000 bots. They found that bots in 2016 were primarily focused on retweets and high volumes of tweets around the same message. However, as human social activity online has evolved, so have bots. In the 2018 election season, just as humans were less likely to retweet as much as they did in 2016, bots were less likely to share the same messages in high volume.

Bots, the researchers discovered, were more likely to employ a multi-bot approach as if to mimic authentic human engagement around an idea. Also, during the 2018 elections, as humans were much more likely to try to engage through replies, bots tried to establish voice and add to dialogue and engage through the use of polls, a strategy typical of reputable news agencies and pollsters, possibly aiming at lending legitimacy to these accounts.

Forecasts predict that, in the coming years, these new technologies will affect millions of workers in a wide range of occupations, replacing human workers in numerous tasks, but potentially also in whole occupations. Despite the intense debate about these developments in economics, sociology and other social sciences, research has not examined how people react to the technological replacement of human labour. We begin to address this gap by examining the psychology of technological replacement. Our investigation reveals that people tend to prefer workers to be replaced by other human workers  (versus robots); however, paradoxically, this preference reverses when people consider the prospect of their own job loss. We further demonstrate that this preference reversal occurs because being replaced by machines, robots or soft-ware (versus other humans) is associated with reduced self-threat. In contrast, being replaced by robots is associated with a greater perceived threat to one’s economic future. These findings suggest that technological replacement of human labour has unique psychological consequences that should be taken into account by policy measures (for example, appropriately tailoring support programmes for the unemployed).",1565711901,{},ewrr488,True,t3_cpv37e,False,True,t3_cpv37e,/r/science/comments/cpv37e/psychological_reactions_to_human_versus_robotic/ewrr488/,1565711902.0,1,True,,False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“Intelligence is what you use when you don't know what to do: when neither innateness nor learning has prepared you for the particular situation.”

The software we create and commonly refer to as AI is really just taught specifically how to handle particular situations. We are getting much better at creating software that knows how to handle more and more situations with all sorts of subtle differences thanks to machine learning. Machine learning is just a hyper speed trial-and-error exercise, where software sort of writes its own solution to a situation and tries it, and we tell it if it did something right. Note that ‘we’ don’t actually tell it... another bit of code handles that, because the whole idea is that it’s trying thousands of solutions per second (with no real limit on how many it can try - just tack on more computers to the mainframe to increase capacity). And 99.999% of the solutions it tries are failures, because it’s basically trying random baby steps very fast. It’s really just a numbers game with machine learning. Billions of tries resulting in a couple solutions. 

One example that I love is Google DeepMind which is a supercomputer (which is just tons of computers in sync) learning how to walk from scratch: https://youtu.be/gn4nRCC9TwQ

In that video you see the end result of what was possibly millions of tries to get a 3D model to walk and jump. It probably suffered a majority of its failures in the first couple steps. But once it successfully made it a little further, boom: software is saved and it restarts using what it ‘learned’. I love the hilarious way it walks. It is a good video that illustrates what we commonly refer to as AI - it gets complex jobs done (like walking, which is complex due to all the physics calculations we just take for granted and handle subconsciously), but it isn’t necessarily getting those jobs done in the best way possible. But what’s great about it is that we don’t have to write tons of code for a lot of things anymore. We just write some basics, and write that other piece that can detect right or wrong, and then let it go write all the bulk of the solution code. Eventually we get some automatically generated software that can accomplish something, but it didn’t take tons of man hours meticulously writing it. We didn’t have to write code to handle all the basics of walking and then the added complexities of jumping, rough terrain, etc . We can, and have, written code that makes a ‘3D human shaped object’ walk and handle unknown obstacles, and we’ve written it better (something that doesn’t walk like such a freak and waste so much energy flailing its arms for balance), but it probably took us thousands of times longer for not much of a different end result. The little person got to the other side, maybe a little faster.

But the idea is that we have soooo many tasks out there that would be useful to be written into code that it quickly becomes obvious that we would need like every human on earth to be programmers to even start to produce this code. 

One good example I like is the YouTube algorithms to recommend videos. Let’s say I write a bit that will recommend videos of a certain language based on your location. Okay cool, I’m a German guy in Germany and I just watched a video, it ends, and then the code kicks in to gear and auto-plays a popular German language video. Well, problem is, I was watching an English language video on how to fold a cool paper airplane, and now YouTube is trying to play a German language video about some famous German musicians. No thanks... I stop the video. When I stop the video, YouTube stops making money - no video playing means no ads playing. My code is a failure. So I go back and add a little more... okay this time I take into account a few more bits of info and so now I’m saying if you’re in Germany, and you’re a male, and your age is roughly mid twenties, and you just watched something about arts and crafts, then recommend a popular German or English (because you likely speak both) arts and crafts video. Whoops, this time it started playing a video on how to make a little wooden birdhouse. No thanks - I close my browser, YouTube stops making money. So you start to get an idea of how unrealistic it would be for humans to write code to take into account all the different types of people, age groups, cultures, interests, locations, previous video history, and countless other pieces of information and to make solid recommendations for next video. So, machine learning does it for us. And in this case, WE are the bit of code that tells the machine learning if it was successful or not - we tell it this by either watching what it recommends or not watching it. And there are billions of us watching billions of videos so the software is pretty darn good now. It’ll get you watching YouTube for hours on end sometimes! 

Now, just like the walking weirdo that Google made, it’s not perfect. A specialized team consisting of my friends and family, some psychologists, and maybe some advertising/marketing experts could sit down and write a bit of code that recommends the absolute perfect, most irresistible next video recommendation just for me that would easily beat the algorithms suggestions. But that took a lot of people and a lot of analysis just to get me to watch one more video and more importantly one more ad which I skipped in 5 seconds and YouTube made like a hundredth of a penny off of. This little example of writing the perfect code tailored to me is a slight tangent, but it’s meant to highlight the value of data. These big tech companies are dying to know every scrap of information they can get about you so that they can feed it all into these machine learning algorithms and get better and better at keeping you engaged and coming back to their site. They don’t really have evil intentions, but at the same time, having alllll that data about you out there can be bad if bad people get a hold of it. The talk nowadays frames Mark Zuckerberg as some sort of creepy, spying big brother. But the truth is, these companies are doing amazing things with this data and we should be all for it. The focus needs to be strictly on what these companies are doing to make sure this data is highly secured and can’t fall in to the wrong hands. They can’t be lazy about where they store it or who they allow access to it. Facebook got lazy, some bad actor got loads of info about us, and it used that to manipulate our election by feeding us bullshit news that it knew would catch our attention and monitoring how we were reacting to different candidates actions, thus allowing them to recommend that THEIR candidate avoid this action or try this action.

Anyway, we are a long, long, long ways off from true Artificial Intelligence, but calling machine learning ‘AI’ is the norm nowadays and that’s fine because good machine learning can piece together sooooo much code to handle sooooo many scenarios and variables that it starts to look more like intelligence every day. These personal assistants like Google Assistant, Amazon Echo, and Siri are just trying to give you the best answers and they’re documenting everything they can and continuously writing more and better code to try and better handle more and more questions or requests. It’s pretty amazing because there aren’t any engineers writing answers to the millions of questions these things get every day - machine learning is just documenting every single one of these questions and whether or not it seems like it gave the right answer or did the right thing, and it’s changing its code accordingly. Eventually, after another decade and trillions more trial-and-error exercises, they’ll be so robust that it will be very challenging to get a wrong answer or action out of it, thus making it look more and more like some sort of intelligence. Tack on a more realistic voice and something like Jarvis from Iron Man is totally feasible in the 2020s. That’s how powerful machine learning is. It’s like an extra trillion (and growing) humans, just writing code day after day nonstop. So while a lot of people might get snobby by saying ‘that’s NOT AI’, it’s important to realize that machine learning is still an incredibly powerful thing and it’s what we are going to have in the interim until a REAL AI is created, if ever, and machine learning will eventually create systems that are 99% as effective as a real AI and almost indistinguishable from it in most used, as long as we just keep feeding it computing power and good data and feedback.",1565168304,{},ew6ghji,False,t3_cmzj8n,False,True,t1_ew67gm6,/r/science/comments/cmzj8n/researchers_reveal_ai_weaknesses_by_developing/ew6ghji/,1565168305.0,1,True,,False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**ABSTRACT**

&gt;There have been decades of research on the usability and educational value of augmented reality. However, less is known about how augmented reality affects social interactions. The current paper presents three studies that test the social psychological effects of augmented reality. Study 1 examined participants’ task performance in the presence of embodied agents and replicated the typical pattern of social facilitation and inhibition. Participants performed a simple task better, but a hard task worse, in the presence of an agent compared to when participants complete the tasks alone. Study 2 examined nonverbal behavior. Participants met an agent sitting in one of two chairs and were asked to choose one of the chairs to sit on. Participants wearing the headset never sat directly on the agent when given the choice of two seats, and while approaching, most of the participants chose the rotation direction to avoid turning their heads away from the agent. A separate group of participants chose a seat after removing the augmented reality headset, and the majority still avoided the seat previously occupied by the agent. Study 3 examined the social costs of using an augmented reality headset with others who are not using a headset. Participants talked in dyads, and augmented reality users reported less social connection to their partner compared to those not using augmented reality. Overall, these studies provide evidence suggesting that task performance, nonverbal behavior, and social connectedness are significantly affected by the presence or absence of virtual content.",1559161149,{},epd27iz,True,t3_bujlmc,False,True,t3_bujlmc,/r/science/comments/bujlmc/augmented_reality_changes_how_people_interact_and/epd27iz/,1559163154.0,3,True,,False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,1559764532.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel your comment strongly, I've named something in my own head The Fallacy of Rational Thought, the tendency, in looking for a rational explanation, once we find one, we do not keep looking. That is to say, there are often MANY rational conclusions that could be made, and the fallacy is assuming that the specific rational thought about the situation in your head, is the most correct of the many possible ALSO RATIONAL things.

It's especially hazardous, as us humans are very proactive rationalizers, and sometimes very willing to render ourselves blind thanks to cognitive dissonance. Not saying that cognitive dissonance is not a useful, likely necessary heuristic for a viable conscious organism, but that it's a heuristic that can be 
counterproductive for the complex and syntactically-augmented thinking capabilities we have, that allow us to express more complexity and reason about hypotheticals, is more vulnerable to counterproductive dissonance between ideas, perhaps making reassessments of reality in the face of incorrect models get harder as we accumulate increasingly complex models and heuristics. Caused in part perhaps because of the tendency to think of words and ideas as being more concrete and specific than they are, rather than narrow references to large interconnected systems that do not necessarily follow same linearity as reasoning can at times lead us to think.

This is not to say that reasoning is futile and ineffective, but that reasoning should be a generative process that we do not just one per explanation, but that we try to ""reasonably explore the space of possible reasonable explanations"" to look for traps or alternative viable situations. I imagine this is difficult to start doing, as having previously considered alternatives to other phenomenal explanations in the past may be necessary to recognize them in the future, as a pivotal alternative reasonable explanation may be predicated on inclusion of other possible explanations in that person's mind about concepts this new one is building on.

Hello Raptor (if that is your real name) … this is Kurt. You are correct, phased array radars have been around for about 50 years and were initially developed for military applications. The cost of phased array radar has limited development for civilian applications until the digital age came about and reduced the cost of the electronic components. Military phased array radars were developed for aircraft and missile detection. But weather radars operate differently from aircraft detection radars — we’re looking at the combined returns of thousands of individual drops. Additionally, the WSR-88D was recently upgraded with dual polarization capabilities that haven’t yet been fully developed on phased array radar technology. Adding dual polarization technology to phased array radar continues to be our greatest technical challenge. We are currently developing a first-of-its-kind dual polarization phased array radar that will be used to evaluate the polarimetric performance and calibration abilities of phased array radar. Our first large-scale polarimetric phased array “weather” radar should be ready for testing during the 2019 storm season.

*What kind of performance increases can we expect of meteorologists using phased array radars versus the old NEXRAD system? Do the performance increases depend on storm type?*

Raptor, Katie here. This is a great question! This is one I spent years querying for my Ph.D. research. We have put National Weather Service forecasters through different experiments at the [NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed](https://hwt.nssl.noaa.gov/) to investigate the impact of rapidly-updating phased-array radar data on their warning decision processes. One aspect we’ve looked at is forecasters’ performance (both accuracy and lead time) during a variety of weather events. In a nutshell, yes we can expect to see performance increases if we provide weather forecasters faster radar updates. In our studies, forecasters using 1-minute radar updates (compared to 5-minute radar updates) issued less false alarms and were able to better discriminate between weather threats. Overall, we saw improvements in lead time too (on average warnings were issued several minutes to ten minutes earlier), with the greatest improvements occurring for isolated supercell tornado events. Forecasters were better able to detect trends in severe weather precursor signatures within the radar data when they were using the faster radar updates. We found these trends improved their abilities to apply their conceptual models and understanding of storm evolution and make more mastery (i.e., confident and correct) decisions! As a side note, we have also tracked weather forecasters’ eye movements during their interaction with phased-array radar data. It was really fascinating to watch how they interrogate the radar data and move around the warning interface. We were able to use these eye-tracking data to provide an objective assessment for differences in how forecasters went about their jobs when using 1-min versus 5-min radar updates.

*Are any new visualization tools or styles being developed for meteorologists (for example, augmented reality could potentially help meteorologists visualize 3D storm structure), or are the standard ""slices"" of reflectivity, velocity, etc. good enough?*

Hi Raptor, this is Terry.  As part of our research, we are continually working with forecasters in an attempt to better understand how to best present radar data and products in an operational environment.  Over the years, a variety of visualization capabilities have been developed and tested, including several packages that have 3D capabilities. When radar data, which are typically collected as a series of “conical scans” at a variety of elevations, are interpolated to a 3D grid, they can then be combined with other environmental parameters, such as environmental temperature with height. An example of such a product is the size of a severe storm “reflectivity core” at the -20C temperature level, which is a product that can be used to gauge severe storm strength. I am currently not aware of any radar visualization tools that implement augmented reality.

*Will phased array radar data have an impact on the accuracy of model outputs? Additionally, do you anticipate any performance increase in the Warn-on-Forecast program from being able to use phased array radar data to help initialize the short-term models?*

Katie here again… Raptor, yes, scientists here at NSSL do expect phased array radar data to positively impact the accuracy of model outputs. There have been several studies that have assimilated real as well as synthetic rapidly-updating radar observations into numerical models, and the results show more realistic forecasts of convective storms. One of the most recent studies by Supinie et al. (2017) reported the assimilation of phased array radar data led to improved alignment between the model-predicted and radar-derived locations of storm rotation. So, we have high hopes for the ways phased-array radar data can help advance the predictability of the WoF model.",1523558422,,dx99cio,True,t3_8bpld3,,True,t1_dx95qnf,/r/science/comments/8bpld3/hi_reddit_were_jessica_schultz_kurt_hondl_terry/dx99cio/,1526252944.0,2,True,,False,science,t5_mouw,,,,,,1415135570.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,2.0,3312.0,,public,False,

476,[],benjamindavidsteele,,,[],,,,text,t2_egz2b,False,,"It's hard to compare. In some Asian countries that are the longest lived in the world, they eat more fatty meat than Westerners, including Americans. In research on Asian populations, fatty meat is associated with better health indicators and longer life. So, this complicates the research that finds the opposite in some Western countries, although even in Western research the results are mixed and sometimes fall in line with the Asian research.

Anyway, saying Americans have a fatty diet is a bit misleading. Our 'fat' intake is the same as it was from a century ago, but what kind of fat has changed. In the 19th century and earlier, Americans ate a diet high in butter, lard, and wild game (because, prior to modern chemicals, grain yields were low and gardening difficult; as discussed by Nina Teicholz in *The Big Fat Surprise*). Saturated fat and animal fat in general has been on the decline. Starting in the 1930s, industrial seed oils (and margarine) became the majority of 'fat' in the American diet and it has held that place ever since.

Industrial seed oils are not like other fats, including other vegetable oils. As omega-6 fatty acids, they are inflammatory. And in replacing anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, they have tipped the modern diet toward the highly inflammatory. Many diseases of civilization in the modern health epidemic involve inflammation: arthritis, mood disorders, Alzheimer's, etc --- even heart disease (inflammation causes harm to arterial walls and the body to produce cholesterol in forming the plaque as a scab in an attempt at healing.

Also, because of the industrial process, seed oils are oxidized. Then they are further oxidized in cooking with them. This might not be as bad if not for the fact that the industrial process also destroys the natural oxidants that originally were in the seeds. This relates to, as Dr. Catherine Shanahan argues, their mutagenic effect and might be behind the increase of de novo (first generation) genetic mutations that are commonly found in conditions such as autism spectrum disorder.

If all of that wasn't bad enough, these industrial seed oils interfere with the body's ability to process and use certain nutrients. This is seen with vitamin A. In *Nutritionism*, Gyorgy Scrinism writes (p. 211):

“The nutritional engineering of foods can create nutrient-level contradictions, whereby the enhancement or removal of a particular nutrient by food manufacturers interferes with the quantities or absorption of other desirable nutrients. For instance, studies have shown that the concentrated quantities of plant sterols in cholesterol-lowering margarines block the absorption of beta-carotene and therefore lower vitamin A levels in the body. 27 Consumers of sterol-enriched foods are therefore encouraged to compensate for this nutrient-level contradiction by eating more fruits and vegetables to increase their vitamin A levels.”

It isn't only that Americans are mostly eating industrial seed oils and margarines now. These seed oils are particularly found in highly processed junk food and fast food. Decades ago, they replaced tallow by McDonald's in frying food. Tallow is what used to make fast food french fries so deliciously crispy, rather than soggy as they are these days. Even Walter Willett, who inherited the mantle of Ancel Keys, thinks that the anti-fat diet he helped promote has led to failure in how it has led to an increase of unhealthy seed oils.",1569353667,{},f1cas8t,False,t3_d8dcm0,False,True,t1_f1azl57,/r/science/comments/d8dcm0/todays_obesity_epidemic_may_have_been_caused_by/f1cas8t/,1569353670.0,1,True,[],False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does, gene editing is basically going to be regulated the same as conventional breeding so the regulatory shortcomings are moot.

&gt;Herbicide tolerance is the simple answer

Herbicide tolerance comes with all forms of agriculture, and of course is not innate to genetic engineering. Why do people seem to think the only think you can do with GE is HT, new crops that are coming out are going to change that perception. But, there are non GMO breeds of corn that have become resistant to certain pesticides like alachor. Resistance can be mitigated with a dual herbicide strategy.

No, it didn't it's speculative at this point. Solve citrus greening or any of the things I've listed then get back to me with the surperiority of selective breeding.


&gt;Yes but they get overloaded when genes and gene cassettes are inserted.

What do you mean overloaded, there's usually only one or two genes inserted in a backcross, why would the mechanisms that repair DNA suddenly not work because transgenes are involved. Also you could make several attempts until you see perfection in the transcriptomic assay. Again you're not pointing to a specific danger that this can cause to either the environment or humans.

&gt;More steps

It's about time and not steps sweetheart, gene editing wins hands down in this department. 

&gt;Gene editing will only be for certain specialty uses but not for general food crops.

Nonsense, what makes you say that? Scientist are studying rice with CRISPR edits. And transgenics still has a future with things like pathogen protection.

Sorry but that is wrong and the loud shouting does not change that. We have off target effects and transgene introgression to wild relatives. The agricultural interests concocted a 'global scientific consensus' before the results are in which fooled you.

The only drawback for selective breeding is the time scale which is no longer an issue.

&gt;There is no shred of evidence saying that ""stepwise gene mods are inherently safer"" that's a claim you've never substantiated.

Sure there is. Genomes have repair mechanisms which work better with stepwise changes. Inserting transgenes not only disrupts at insertion points and antisense but also associated genes elsewhere on the genome.

The sterile insect technique, or SIT for short, is among the most environment-friendly insect pest control methods ever developed. **Irradiation, such as with gamma rays and X-rays, is used to sterilize mass-reared insects so that,** while they remain sexually competitive, they cannot produce offspring.

The [International Plant Protection Convention](https://www.ippc.int/en/) categorizes sterile insects as beneficial organisms. The SIT differs from classical biological control, which involves the introduction of non-native biological control agents, in several ways:

* Breaking the pest's reproductive cycle, also called autocidal control, is by definition species-specific.

Exactly how all these problem spaces fit together and which ones contain other ones are some of the most important open problems in quantum computing and computer science.

* It's quantized - it's a wave and particle
* It's a vector - it has direction and magnitude and this is central to how it interacts
* It will have a preferred directions in a lattice based on the lattice structure
* It can be a transverse or longitudinal oscillation (like light or like sound) in how it propagates through a material.
* Phonons are central to a lot of common physics systems

Examples of this include:

* Indirect vs. Direct gap semiconductors - indirect gap generation or recombination processes involve a photon PLUS a phonon, while direct gap only require a photon.  This specific fact is why all electrooptic semiconductors are generally III-V such as Gallium Arsenide, Indium Phosphide, etc. - which are all primarily direct gap.  And why silicon sucks at electrooptic quantum efficiency.  Indirect gap photogeneration is central to light sensing or light emission but in silicon you must have a precise phonon (vector direction and magnitude) to generate a electron-hole pair from a photon absorption or generate a photon from an electron-hole recombination.  The odds of that particle vector alignment of a lattice vibration (which are generally random in all directions) is small so the efficiency is small.
* Thermal conductivity in materials is mediated by phonon propagation through the atomic lattice of a material.
* Superfluids such as Helium 2 conduct heat as sound in the form of phonons.  This is called [second sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_sound).
* Electrical conductivity can be affected by phonons and phonon characteristics: **this is the gist of what this article is talking about** It's not a new thing per se.

Yes, as opposed to fiber optics used today. The latter half of that quote literally states: ""and be orders of magnitude higher.""

&gt; Classical mechanics is a lot simpler than quantum mechanics though.

I think you mean easier to understand. That's not the same as complexity. Complexity refers to the number of moving parts. 

&gt; And you're conflating computer components with universe components. Just because you're working at the atomic level, doesn't mean your computer components are small and indivisible.

... this is a really dumb statement for a number of reasons. One, people don't work on the atomic level. We're not quantum. Two, you just presented a dichotomy between computer science and physics. Everything is made of atoms, no exception. There's a bottom up explaination for everything. And Three, that's literally why its called quantum computing. In order to reduce those bits to their smallest quantum components. If you don't understand this then why are you responding to me? We're clearly not talking about the same thing, and I'm starting to wonder what you're even doing here at all. 

&gt; A qubit requires a lot more working compoments than a regular bit. 

A qbit is an entangled particle. It requires 2 particles. You're referring to the mechanics of a quantum computer, not the complexity of the data. We already discussed this. 

""It doesn't matter that the equipment is more complex. We're not talking about equipment, we're talking about data. And the signal is still cleaner, faster and has fewer errors because of how few working components it has. Which is where your bandwidth and bulk processing advantages come from.""

You're the one conflating complexity with engineering. That's the same thing as claiming that a cake is healthier because more people worked on it. That's unrelated. Your problem here is terminology, and you're not using it properly. I'm using the term complexity form an information theory standpoint. Not to mean big and hard to understand. 

&gt; In terms of real computing, data has to exist on equipment and be processed by equipment.

Doesn't change the complexity of the signal. Radio transmitters can come as towers or cell phone receivers that fit in your pocket. They still produce a comparable quality signal. Again, this is just a semantic argument because you don't like the terms being used. This is how a theist or a con artist argues, but redefining semantics because they were offended. 

&gt; No. You won't get higher bandwidth of traditional binary data. Simple calculations aren't faster. Only specific complex ones. 

Yes you do get faster bandwidth, orders of magnitude faster due to the explanation I gave earlier. Entangled particles produce virtually zero noise. You know an electric current interferes with itself, right? There's a noise threshold below which you can't discern 1s or 0s. 

&gt; The probability states of superpositions are a lot less ""clean"" than a binary voltage state. 

No. For the reason I just stated above. 

&gt; It's not faster, it still travels at the speed of light.

No. Now your conflating fiberoptics with quantum computing. Neither quantum computers nor classical computers operate at light speed. But quantum computers *can* get a hell of a lot closer. This breaks down to the speed of discharge from the slowest working components, transistors. And my noise explanation applies here. The more noise, the stronger signal you need to produce, which takes more time. This is *why* a cleaner signal is faster. 

&gt; Because what you said is wildly off the mark with regards to quantum computer and quantum networking (which uses are basically transferring quantum specific data and high security)

Okay. Then prove something. Support any claim you made. You didn't. I'm not the one that's bullshitting here. You're just naysaying, and reframing semantics, because you feel irked. That's it. You haven't reasoned anything. And now that I have a few posts of experience with you, I don't expect you to anymore either. 

I'm confident that you're not smart enough to learn from your mistakes, and especially considering you rehashed the same sub-intellectual problems even after I explained them to you, so you're blocked. I made my points and you're too obtuse to understand them. You're not worth any more of my time.

In fact for quite some time there were many proponents of the whole ""local hidden variables"" theories, including Einstein, which is just a fancy way of saying they were doing that all along.  I think it's typically not explained well because it isn't easy to put an explanation into simple punchlines.  You should read up on the ""Copenhagen interpretation"" if you want to know more about this in particular.  

The fundamental thing about the Copenhagen interpretation is that it typically defines particles as a function of a wave rather than a particle with a specific location. This is closely entwined as well with the conclusions of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  

The greatest proof we have of the ""wave collapse at measurement"" is simply how successful the associated mathematics are with this theory.  I don't think I can simplify the math in an ELI5 sort of manner, but essentially there are mathematical ""consequences"" to both of the theories that would show up in extended testing.  So far as we've observed to date it seems to suggest that the wave collapse is at the moment of measurement.  The most famous example of this is the ""two slit"" experiment, where a single photon interacts with itself like a wave traveling through two slits simultaneously (a coherence pattern), as opposed to a single object traveling through a single slit.  

That being said, there is still some debate about the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.  Unlike many other mechanics in classical physics, where we can more or less point to a field or force of some kind that ""causes"" particle effects, quantum physics seems to be governed by a degree of randomness.  We can mathematically model the randomness into functions, but afaik there is no evidence of what underlying mechanism controls it.  

I prefer to think of it similar to how a crafty computer engineer creates complex computer game mechanics.  Lets say you have 500 million ""sims"" in your game that you want to make appear as if they're doing stuff all the time.  Computing the individual actions of each sim while the ""player"" isn't watching them would be prohibitively expensive on your computational ability, memory, etc.  If no one is watching, there is basically no point in computing what they're up to.  As soon as the ""player"" or observer pops over to look at them, the computer has to decide what they're doing right then.  Rather than compute the whole string of events leading up to this moment to determine their states, the computer just decides what they've been doing based on probability function.  

E.G. the ""player"" looks over where two ""sims"" would live.  The computer uses a probability function of all undefined sims to pick two that would live there.  These are now an entangled pair because they were created simultaneously.  The player then hovers over House 1 (like a scientist measuring the spin of a particle) and the computer has to decide which sim lives there.  Probability is run again and the computer decides Sim Alice lives in House 1.  Because there are two houses (or states) that the sims could live in, the entangled pair Sim Bob is instantly known by the computer to live in House 2 without running the probability again.  

I think this is part of the reason why some people believe that we actually exist in a ""simulation"", among other things.

The Fasting Cure Is No Fad
New research is showing the profound benefits—for weight, longevity and fighting disease—of eating only during limited hours

Fasting is one of the biggest weight-loss trends to arise in recent years. Endorsed by A-list celebrities and the subject of a spate of best-selling books, it was the eighth most-Googled diet in America in 2018.

But fasting shouldn’t be dismissed as just another fad. At the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, I’ve employed what’s called intermittent fasting, or time-restricted eating, to help patients with an array of chronic conditions. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, rheumatism and bowel diseases, as well as pain syndromes such as migraines and osteoarthritis.

There are different ways to go about it, but I advise patients to omit either dinner or breakfast, so that they don’t ingest any food for at least 14 hours at a stretch. That makes lunch the most important meal of the day. It also reduces the time spent each day processing food and lengthens the period devoted to cleansing and restoring the body’s cells, both of which have positive health effects.

Adopting this technique is not as difficult as it may seem. If you sleep from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., you’ve already fasted for eight hours. Now you only need another six. It’s healthy to avoid eating late in the evening to let your body burn energy from food rather than store it, so if you eat dinner by 7 p.m., that’s another four hours. For breakfast, you can limit yourself to coffee or tea (maybe with a small piece of fruit) and make lunch your first proper meal. By that time, you’re clearly beyond the 14 hours and don’t need to restrain yourself: You can eat until you are full.

Scientific evidence for the glory of breakfast is scarce. Instead, we should skip it and eat lunch like kings.
The biologist Satchidananda Panda at California’s Salk Institute showed the possibilities of this approach in a 2012 report in the journal Cell Metabolism. He fed a group of mice a high-fat diet around the clock for 18 weeks; they developed fatty livers, pancreatic disease and diabetes. Another group was fed the exact same number of calories a day, but all during an eight-hour span. Surprisingly, the second group stayed slimmer and healthier for much longer.

There is a logic to it. When we eat, our body releases insulin. That disrupts the process of autophagy (from the Greek, meaning “self-devouring”), by which cells deconstruct old, damaged components in order to release energy and build new molecules. Autophagy helps to counteract the aging of cells and builds immunity. Fasts stimulate autophagy and allow the full molecular process to take place, as a team led by Frank Madeo at the University of Graz in Austria found in 2017.

Fasting also can contribute to brain health and happiness. The neurobiologist Mark Mattson, who retired this year from the National Institutes of Health, has demonstrated in experiments for two decades that nerve growth factors contribute significantly to brain health and positive mood. He also found that fasting, restricting calories and exercising spur distinct increases in the best-known nerve growth factor, BDNF.

Test animals in Dr. Mattson’s laboratory that fasted intermittently even showed a significantly lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s, though those results would have to be clearly confirmed in large human studies to reach any firm conclusion.

All of this presents a question: If we should generally eat only two meals a day, which meal is it best to skip? Many of us have heard the saying: “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and supper like a pauper.” Scientific evidence for the glory of breakfast is scarce, however, and realistically, it’s easier to sustain skipping breakfast than skipping dinner.

Instead of breakfast, we should eat lunch like kings. A rich lunch beats a robust dinner. A U.K.-led study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2016 showed that among 69 women, those who consumed most of their calories at lunch shed 3.3 pounds more in 12 weeks than those who ate a bigger dinner. After all, it’s around lunchtime that the body requires the greatest amount of energy for keeping its body temperature up. Less energy thus passes into our fat reserves.

Fasting overcomes an instinctive need in a way that gives us physical and mental strength.
Researchers are increasingly probing the optimal timing of meals, duration of fasting and the various potential health effects. Scientists at the University of Padua have found, for instance, that young, healthy athletes fasting for 16 hours benefited from metabolic changes over eight weeks compared with their peers. The regimen lowered the levels of inflammatory factors in their blood and factors accelerating the aging process, including insulin.

Fasting might even be effective in preventing the recurrence of cancer, as suggested by initial results of an epidemiological study conducted by researchers at the University of California at San Diego, published in 2016 in the journal JAMA Oncology. Among 2,400 women with early-stage breast cancer who provided information on their eating rhythm, roughly 400 suffered from new tumors within seven years. But women who fasted for 13 hours nightly had 26% less risk of recurrence than the control group. One possible reason was suggested in data summarized last year from a decade of animal experiments by Valter Longo and a team at the University of Southern California: Cancer cells are less able than normal cells to survive a lack of sugar.

As a practice, fasting is more than simply restricting calories or nutrients. For many people, it is also a spiritual experience. Over the course of our lives, we encounter many kinds of deficiency, whether of money, success or affection. Fasting is a conscious renunciation, a controlled exercise in deprivation. That’s why successful fasting increases self-efficacy—we overcome an instinctive need in a way that gives us physical and mental strength. In his novel “Siddhartha,” Hermann Hesse describes this wonderfully: “Nothing is performed by demons; there are no demons. Anyone can perform magic. Anyone can reach his goals if he can think, if he can wait, if he can fast.”

&gt;-	do humans and AI make the same kind of errors? Is the AI missing things that could be obvious to a human expert or vice versa, implying that using both would’ve allow detection rates neither can achieve?

Excellent questions. What we currently see is that the mistakes they make are completely different and not related at all. However, it does not have to mean both combined are better: there is also a large psychological component. You can see this in some of the ""self-driving"" Tesla crashes, where the human driver trusts the system too much as it is usually right, but can fail spectacularly. I'm not sure on the research about this for the medical field, but doctors for sure would need additional training.

&gt;-	How good is the sample data, really? When we train visual AI on something like facial recognition, we don’t have to be concerned that we’re teaching it our biases because we haven’t got any, we’re nearly 100% at being able to decide if there is a human face in front of us. But we can’t know which images, in which *we* could find nothing, could have subtle features that machine learning could indeed find. It seems to me that at best visual AI could be as good as our very best, but if we want it fonfind what we cannot, it seems to me we have to find a way to train it do so.

Great question again. Something we can do is use information that wasn't available at the time of the original data, for example follow-up data: you can train the AI using information that, for example, there'd be a tumour found within five years.

585,[],crusafo,,,[],,,,text,t2_d75ap,False,,"TL;DR: No ""actual artificial intelligence"" does not exist, its pure science fiction right now.  


I am a CompSci grad, worked as a programmer for quite a few years. The language may have changed, since I was studying the concept several years ago, with more modern concepts being added as the field of AI expands, but there is fundamentally the idea of ""weak"" and ""strong"" AI.   


""Actual artificial Intelligence"" as you are referring to it is strong AI - that is essentially a sentient application, an application that can respond, even act, dynamically, creatively, intuitively, spontaneously, etc., to different subjects, stimulus and situations. Strong AI is not a reality and won't be a reality for a long time. Thankfully. Because it is uncertain whether such a sentient application would view us as friend or foe. Such a sentient application would have the abilities of massive computing power, access to troves of information, have a fundamental understanding of most if not all the technology we have built, in addition to having the most powerful human traits: intuition, imagination, creativity, dynamism, logic. Such an application could be humanities greatest ally, or its worst enemy, or some fucked up hybrid in between.   


Weak AI is more akin to machine learning: IBM's deep blue chess master, Nvidia/Tesla self driving cars, facial recognition systems, Google goggles, language parsing/translation systems, and similar apps, are clever apps that go do a single task very well, but they cannot diverge from their programming, cannot use logic, cannot have intuition, cannot take creative approaches. Applications can learn through massive inputs of data to differentiate and discern in certain very specific cases, but usually on a singular task, and with an enormous amount of input and dedicated individuals to ""guide the learning process"". Google taught an application to recognize cats in images, even just a tail or a leg of a cat in an image, but researchers had to input something like 15 million images of cats to train the system to just do that task. AI in games also falls under this category of weak AI.   


Computer Science is still an engineering discipline. You need to understand the capabilities and limitations of the tools you have to work with, and you need to have a very clear understanding of what you are building. Ambiguity is the enemy of software engineering. As such, we still have no idea what consciousness is, what awareness fundamentally is, how we are able to make leaps of intuition, how creativity arises in the brain, how perception/discernment happens, etc. And without knowledge of the fundamental mechanics of how those things work in ourselves, it will be impossible to replicate that in software. The field of AI is growing increasingly connected to both philosophy and to neuro-science. Technology is learning how to map out the networks in the brains and beginning to make in-roads to discovering how the mechanisms of the brain/body give rise to this thing called consciousness. While philosophy continues on from a different angle trying to understand who and what we are. At some point down the road in the future, provided no major calamity occurs, it is hypothesized that there will be a convergence and true strong AI will be born, whether that is hundreds or thousands of years into the future is unknown.",1565163449,{},ew6d0wi,False,t3_cmzj8n,False,True,t1_ew67gm6,/r/science/comments/cmzj8n/researchers_reveal_ai_weaknesses_by_developing/ew6d0wi/,1565163449.0,1,True,,False,science,t5_mouw,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

591,[],i_Got_Rocks,,,[],,,,text,t2_guss7,False,,"Sources at the bottom.  Most of this is an interdisciplinary approach based on it's a lot of info to condense, but I can give you some starting points.

The topic of ""properly raising"" a child is something that is imperfect or incomplete research, so a lot of ""How to properly do it"" basically amounts to, ""How do we produce adults that aren't trying to recover from their childhood?"" 

We have plenty of data to indicate a positive direction for child rearing.

This leads us to a lot of rabbit holes, some of which I'll try to bullet point.

1. A great majority of adult addicts have mental, emotional, physical/sexual abuse, or neglect as children. That's not controversial or farfetched. It can happen to ""healthy"" adults as well who suffer PTSD or other trauma and become addicts later in life even though they had an okay starting point as children. This tells us something about unresolved pain in the brain.

2. We know that in high-stress situations the thinking part of the brain (neo cortex) shuts down and we process things more emotionally with our mammalian and reptilian brains.  Physiologically, the body prepares to **fight or flight**; blood leaves the internal organs, responsible cell reparation and digesting (No need to digest if you're about to die, better send those resources to fight off danger)--hence why you have a need to throw up or have knot in your stomach. Your body doesn't know ""stage fright"" vs ""fighting a bear"" fear--it only knows fear. Blood pressure rises, goes to your arms--gearing up for fight or flight.

3. In the case that you cannot fight or flight--your brain ""flights"" on your behalf.  Since the body is only looking to preserve itself, to live, it doesn't matter if it breaks along the way, as long as you survive, it's adaptation at it's finest. There's plenty of accounts of rape victims where their mind ""blacks out"" the incident. They remember the account leading up to the event, they remember their bodies being sharply attuned to danger--and they may remember freezing with fear, but the actual incident is impossible to remember. They also remember ""waking up"" in the after math. The actual trauma is blocked off because it's too painful. A similar, but much more evident case is witnessed in boxers who's knees buckle moments before they fall--sometimes without a punch landing on them: the brain realizes the physical pain is too much danger, and the best chances of living is by conserving energies in shut down mode. Sometimes it's the result of too much blunt trauma, but the function is the same: survive by any means, even if we wake up damaged.

4. We know being too authoritative or too permissive with kids leads to behavioral problems--Helicopter parenting doesn't allow for healthy exploration and self-identity while too much exploration without guidance leads to other problems because it's neglect.

All this to say: If a kid is in a high-stress environment, due to neglect or other trauma, they won't feel safe with the adults. The adults are necessary for the child's development: brain, body, and for general survival--as a newborn cannot survive out of the womb like other creatures. Thus, when a child is left to seek on its own--more or less--due to a lack of guidance, it will have negative consequences.  

Human beings have a great intuition for faces and expressive eyes. There's a lot of communication done with eyes and we have so much white space in order to communicate silently. Toddlers will often look for eye contact as recognition of their efforts, to share joy, or look away when ashamed or negative emotions arise. These same signs are seen in healthy adult human interactions.  And it's something that is taught to children with autism since it's an important part of being understood.

There's evidence that this type of eye communication starts much earlier, possibly since birth. Letting us know that the first three years are more important than we previously thought since the baby learns communication this early--so if a parent is already neglecting them, they will possibly start developing coping mechanism due to the stress.

We also know that stress on a pregnant woman can cause birth complications.

With that much info, we can understand that a human child needs a parent who aren't over-stressed and can aid their development.

The ""Unconditional Love"" part means that the parent is well-adjusted and the child **feels** that the parent will **ALWAYS** help when the kid is in trouble. The kid will naturally, over time, learn to do things themselves: with physical activities, with problem solving, with relationships. Again, this is natural since kids can't even walk out of the womb or are able to feed themselves like other animals: their brain development hasn't stopped. Our brains don't stop fully developing until we're about 25 years of age.

And this means the brain needs a relaxed and supportive environment to develop. We know too much stress on the body and brain will keep it from developing properly. So, traumatic events and neglect make the individual (whose brain hasn't had the environment for good development) develop other ways of coping just to get by.

&gt;All the participants repeated the same experiment, but this time we deprived them of sleep, including the critical stage of REM. Half of the participants went through the sleep deprivation session first, followed by the sleep session second, and vice versa. In each session, a different individual was featured in the pictures, so there was no memory or repetition effects.
Having had a full night of sleep, which contained REM sleep, participants demonstrated a beautifully precise tuning curve of emotional face recognition, rather like a stretched out V shape. When navigating the cornucopia of facial expressions we showed them inside the MRI scanner, their brains had no problem deftly separating one emotion from another across the delicately changing gradient, and the accuracy of their own ratings proved this to be similarly true. It was effortless to disambiguate friendly and approachable signals from those intimating even minor threat as the emotional tide changed toward the foreboding.
&gt;Confirming the importance of the dream state, the better the quality of REM sleep from one individual to the next across that rested night, the more precise the tuning within the emotional decoding networks of the brain the next day. Through this platinum-grade nocturnal service, better REM-sleep quality at night provided superior comprehension of the social world the next day.
&gt;But when those same participants were deprived of sleep, including the essential influence of REM sleep, they could no longer distinguish one emotion from another with accuracy. The tuning V of the brain had been changed, rudely pulled all the way up from the base and flattened into a horizontal line, as if the brain was in a state of generalized hypersensitivity without the ability to map gradations of emotional signals from the outside world. Gone was the precise ability to read giveaway clues in another’s face. The brain’s emotional navigation system had lost its true magnetic north of directionality and sensitivity: a compass that otherwise guides us toward numerous evolutionary advantages.
&gt;With the absence of such emotional acuity, normally gifted by the re-tuning skills of REM sleep at night, the sleep-deprived participants slipped into a default of fear bias, believing even gentle- or somewhat friendly looking faces were menacing. The outside world had become a more threatening and aversive place when the brain lacked REM sleep—untruthfully so.

No. It's way too hard outside of very seriously constrained questions. We can't even reliably machine-read basic statistics from a document yet to cross-compare them.

&gt; Because if a study can offer replicable formulas, machine could streamline peer review, and then we need to start talking about machine certification for such jobs.

There are only very narrow domains where this is possible. It would be fascinating work regardless. If I was a government, I'd still fund it.

People think of Matrix or Terminator style general AIs suddenly developing a distaste for humans and deciding to wipe us out, then naturally dismiss the threat as far-fetched. But it's not that type of AI that is dangerous. It is precisely the types of AI you mentioned (stuff that won't take over the world) that could ultimately end us.

Just look at YouTube's watch algorithm. It's basically optimised to maximise watch time, and even the engineers that made it don't know exactly how it works as it was presumably 'bred' like other generative adversarial networks. It's ended up spotlighting and suggesting very problematic videos , from conspiracy stuff, to creepy Spiderman vs Elsa kids videos. It doesn't know what it's doing, it just knows that suggesting xyz will increase the likelihood of user Hunter2 staying on the site longer and generating ad revenue.

At the moment that's as insidious as it goes. But it isn't much of a stretch to see that getting out of hand. A more advanced general AI might decide that Mr. Hunter2 could watch more videos if he didn't have a job. It knows from a few mutant algorithms in the training data that an uptick of watch time was observed in users whose phone alarms didn't go off a few times a week or whose car chose the most traffic filled route. Etc.

Sure it's a little Black Mirror at the moment, and it could be a long way off but it's definitely not worth dismissing concerns about.

Sentience or emotions towards humans is not a pre-requisite for a dangerous AI.

The real magic I think won't be from just the physical understanding of how the brain's structured, so much as it'll be from computational neuro-biology, and an algorithmic understanding of how certain processes actually work. Jeff Hawkin's 'on intelligence' might be a book you'd be interested in. The book's a little old at this point (only a decade!) so a surprising amount of science-fiction hypotheticals in the book have already happened, or are on the very near horizon (computer programs that can recognize objects, self driving cars and so on) but the guts of the book is a conversation around how the human neo-cortex might work, made understandable enough that you can listen to it on a commute or whatever, vs Kandel and James Stone's book are college level textbooks, so I figured I'd throw something out there that's a little more accessible too.",1569341634,{},f1bryrp,False,t3_d8ajbf,False,True,t1_f1a2flb,/r/askscience/comments/d8ajbf/how_do_brain_regions_actually_communicate_together/f1bryrp/,1569341635.0,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To what extent do you think progress in artificial intelligence software depends on embodiment in physical hardware -- robots?  Does teaching an agent to be useful in the real world require giving it the means to collect its own data, take its own actions, and observe the consequences?

Many of the big developments we hear about in AI have come from training software agents to act in simplified virtual systems like games, but it's not clear whether such methods can ever generalize to real-world performance.  Would starting from embodiment in robots, rather than, say, starting from signal processing or statistics or data mining, suggest different perspectives about what AI is and how to build it?  Does it make any sense to start in a ""clean"" environment and build something sophisticated than can hopefully port out, or do you have to start in a ""messy"" environment right from the start in order to keep from going down dead ends?

648,[],adventuringraw,,,[],,,,text,t2_60uwl,False,,"a lot of good specific answers, but I figured you might want the more fundamental version of the story. How do people come up with these compression schemes? How 'good' can a compression scheme be? Do we know when we've got the perfect encoder, or can we always wonder if we can do better? How would we even try and measure what a perfect encoder might do?

In the late 1940's, Claude Shannon was working with Bell Labs and was trying to solve a fundamental problem. How can you reliably send a voice signal over early telephone networks, given that there was noise in the lines? You could try improving signal quality by improving physical infrastructure, but as you can imagine, that gets expensive, and you can run into physical limits that keep you from making further improvements. You'll never get perfect... so, how might you improve things? He actually met Turing in person and discussed Turing's 1936 paper on universal Turing machines, so Shannon's story connects with some pretty cool figures and ideas.

Shannon's research culminated in a 1948 paper laying out the foundations of what's now known as 'information theory'. A few fundamental laws of information theory:

Information has a fundamental measure useful when talking about encoding. 'Entropy'.

Any given communication channel (telephone lines, an encoder/decoder compression scheme, a hard drive read/write process, etc) has a fundamental upper limit of how many bits of information (how much entropy) it can communicate.

that fundamental limit goes down as the channel gets noisy.

you can get arbitrarily close to reaching this 'perfect' limit with the right encoding scheme.

So if you can measure the entropy of a movie, you can figure out how small the final compressed form will be, if you happen to have access to the perfect encoding scheme. Pretty cool. Crazy that you can predict what the 'perfect' encoder would look like before you've even found it, you know?

So what is entropy? It's a mathematical measure that basically captures the amount of 'unexpected' data in the signal, or (put another way specifically for movies) the amount of predictive power you have about one given pixel at one point in time given the values of the others. A pure black movie will have a very low entropy, all pixels at all time steps are perfectly correlated. A full color crowd scene (as someone else pointed out) will have a lot of compression artifacts and won't compress down as well. The reason is because all these complex moving shapes gives you very little predictive power, you kind of have to just know what all the pixels are doing independently, roughly speaking.

If you'd like to know more about information theory, David MacKay's ""Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms"" is an interesting text, teaching information theory from the perspective of what it can reveal about how modern machine learning methods work. I also really enjoyed James Stone's 'principles of neural information theory'. It's a little 150 page book using information theory to derive things like ideal color coding patterns and axon diameters, and shows that our brain appears to be highly optimized for bits/calories. Entropy is measured in bits by the way, so this isn't the normal meaning of bits you might be thinking, it's specifically the bits of entropy in the signal.

The rabbit hole goes even deeper than that though. There's a much less developed alternative of information theory I'm starting to get into from a guy named James Gibson called 'actionable information'. Has to do with the optimal way to encode a signal that gives you specifically what you need to complete a task. Reconstructing the original video feed might be one task, but other tasks might require a very different subset of the data... trying to catch a baseball for example might only need to send and process a very specific subset of the visual information hitting your retina. By the time it hits the conscious centers of your brain, you only notice the things that are relevant to the task at hand. A really interesting question for modern artificial intelligence systems... what might it mean to filter out and encode the useful information you need to accomplish your goals? Cool stuff to think about, wild that there might be useful insights to be gained about consciousness and cognition from this question of video compression.

What does make it special however is that it’s arguably the first jet built purely around the concept of information / situational awareness dominance / (elec)“tron” warfare - the idea that speed is not life, information is life - that the biggest deciding factor is what you know, how you can share and manage that information, and how you can either manipulate or deprive the situational awareness / knowledge of the enemy. The F-22 embraced this concept as well, but it accrues much of its hefty price tag (it costs roughly 2x as much as an F-35A) by trying to also be the best 4th gen possible (by having excellent kinematics).

The concept at its core is simple - how do you beat Mike Tyson in a boxing match while you’re blindfolded? How do you defeat a camouflaged sniper with night vision in the woods, when all you have is a torch?

This isn’t just rhetoric made up by modern airmen who’ve grown up never seeing real air-to-air combat either:

1. **95% of all air-to-air kills across history were made by just 5% of the pilots.**

 Imagine how many more pilots could have scored kills if they were able to get into position or just engage the same enemies? Imagine how many more kills that 5% could have scored if they could have replenished their ammunition in the air? With the F-35 you have a platform that doesn't carry as many air-to-air missiles as some other jet's, but which can share targeting data in realtime with his wingmen and even assets like Navy destroyers equipped with AEGIS and SM-6s, etc.


2. **According to the great (allied and axis) aces, 80–90% of their victims had no idea they were about to be shot down.**

 Those great aces credit much of their success to “boom and zoom” or “ambush” tactics, where you approach unseen from above, dive on the enemy without them seeing you coming, take them out and then climb rapidly out of harm’s way using your built-up speed. Stealth is just simply the 21st century high altitude / flying in front of the sun.

 In Vietnam, approximately 80% of USAF airmen shot down (who survived) had no idea they were about to be shot down.
Again, imagine how they might have fared if they had staring sensors that saw in all directions, could autonomously detect incoming missiles and aircraft, and both take defensive action and precisely show them exactly where the threat was? Also consider how much higher that 80% might be if they were facing enemies that were nearly impossible to detect on radar?

Looking less at the 20th century and more to modern times, pilots who have flown against 5th gen fighters have described another interesting consequence - when you know that there’s an enemy hiding out there, you're also more prone to make mistakes:

&gt;Legacy jets, with the help of AWACs “may have a general idea that there’s an F-35 out there, but they don’t know exactly where we are,” said Flatley.

&gt;The distinct information disadvantage causes pilots to get tunnel vision, according to Flatley.

&gt;“Everything they see becomes the F-35 out there,” said Flatley. “Every radar hit, every communication is about the stealth jet. They want to illuminate or eliminate a threat they can’t handle.”

&gt;The fear and paranoia caused by the presence of stealth jets in a battle has a widespread effect on adversaries that “includes extremely capable legacy jets and certainly includes everything available to adversaries,” said Flatley of updated F-16s, F-15s, and even enemy air defences like Russia’s S-400.

&gt;Even extremely capable operators fall prey to the F-35’s psychological advantage. “It has nothing to do with their skill or technology. They’re at such a technological disadvantage,” said Flatley. “I’ve seen guys in F-18s turn directly in front of me and show me their tails cause they have no idea I’m there.”

&gt;In the end, “It aggregates to a completely inept response to what we’re doing in the air,” said Flatley. “People are so hellbent on shooting down the stealth fighter that they invariably make mistakes that I can exploit.”

In the past, those figures and lessons weren’t entirely unknown, but stealth was too hard and expensive to implement and the avionics + software required for what has been attempted with the F-35 was beyond the scope of anything done previously (the F-35 has 4x as much software code in it as the F-22; the F-35 also has all the same sensors as the F-22 [[radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/APG-81), [electronic warfare suite](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dragon029/comments/6wpcyx/f35_electronic_warfare_quotes/), etc] but with updated technologies, plus extra features like [thermal IR cameras that see in all directions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fm5vfGW5RY), plus another [long range IR sensor under its nose](https://gfycat.com/BlackandwhiteBeautifulHawaiianmonkseal), plus [an augmented reality helmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay6g66FbkmQ) that lets the pilot see through their airplane, target enemies by looking at them, etc).

Back in the Cold War era, where (for most of the war) heatseeker missiles had trouble locking onto anything but the hot exhaust of a fighter (or other IR-bright objects like flares, the sun or reflective waves), where radar guided missiles had to ride beams and could easily lose track, and where being able to target enemies below the horizon was considered advanced, the smart thing of the time was to build jets that flew higher, faster and turned tighter. That way you could send your missiles further than the enemy's and be able to point your sensors (and gun if necessary) at the enemy quicker.

With stealth, your enemy will rarely ever be able to fire their missiles at their maximum range, because they won’t be able to get a lock-on from that kind of distance. With helmet-mounted sights and missiles, equipped with lock on after launch (LOAL) / high off-boresight (HOBS) technology, there’s little reason to turn towards an enemy in a short-range fight as well; [instead you let the missile \(which is far more agile than you or your enemy\) do the turning instead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b-BwMi19JE)

The effectiveness of missiles is also very much demonstrated in historic data - [even as early as the 70’s, the majority of kills were made by missiles that \(today with LOAL / HOBS\) could have been made without necessarily turning, with ~95% of all air-to-air shoot-downs since 1980 \(and there's been nearly 500\) being made with missiles.](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-287d56d18bc7cb658492080c03387863) (From the same CSBA PDF report linked above.)

---

So in summary - the F-35 is designed to fight much differently to previous fighters, even the F-22 in some ways. For those who grew up trying to defeat enemies by flying higher / faster / tighter, this new 5th gen doctrine is controversial. Nevertheless, it’s been showing its effectiveness at events like Red Flag, where even after they seriously stepped up the difficulty (with several surface-to-air missile sites being in operation at the same time, rather than just one, plus with them bringing in private contractor aircraft to increase enemy numbers) [the F-35s that were there scored 145 enemy aircraft kills with 7 F-35 losses \(a ~20:1 ratio\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLjNsB_hyM). 

It's worth noting too that those F-35s participating were using 'early-access' (Block 3i) software, which artificially limits them to 2x AMRAAM missiles, 2x bombs and nothing else (no gun, no ability to swap bombs for missiles), and also limited their turning capability to 7Gs instead of the full 9Gs (this was done for safety while flight testing finished mapping the aircraft's behaviour above 7G; flight testing is wrapping up this month and F-35's will lose all restrictions before the end of February 2018). On top of all of that, insider reports indicated that on at least one occasion, one of the F-35's was killed because enemies are able to respawn by flying back to an invisible / arbitrary bit of airspace, and the F-35 pilot thought that plane was still considered dead. In other, smaller exercises F-35s have been able to get ratios like 24:0, meaning zero F-35 losses.

660,,Holy_City,,,,,,,,t2_bj3zm,,,"First thing the understand is even though inside your ear canal is a single pressure wave, the cochlea inside your ear contains thousands of tiny hairs connected to the auditory nerve. They act as bandpass filters, filtering out a certain range of frequencies to listen to. 

What's important there is to understand we don't hear in the time domain or the frequency domain, we hear in both, the time frequency domain. 

To spacialize audio, our brain first picks out the differences between each signal from each ear in the time frequency domain. Then it combines it with both recent memories of sound and input from other senses like sight to tell us where the sound is. 

The two easiest differences to grasp are level and delay. Something to your left is going to take longer to reach your right ear and it's further away so it will be quieter and delayed. 

But what about forward, back, up, and down? That's where your ear shape first comes into play. The ridges on your pinnae (outer ear) is an acoustic filter. It changes the magnitude response (basically the level of every frequency), and it does it based on the angle of the sound source with respect to your head. Something in front of you will be filtered differently based on its elevation. 

But consider a sound directly behind you, above you or below you. However, no sound will exist in an empty space. There will always be reflections off objects. Your brain can tell where something is not only on the initial contact of the wave with your ears but also by the timing of the reflections it hears. 

Then there's the time-frequency aspect. When a wave hits an object larger than its wavelength it is not reflected but bent around the object. So low-ish frequency sounds that hit your head from above, behind or below you will bend around the curves of your head. This causes delays between the ears, and it's different for different frequencies. Because your brain can pick out delays down to the microseconds, these interaural time delays (ITDs) as their called are the most significant factor in sound localization. 

And lastly there's the adaptive component, or the fact your brain perceives sound location not only on the contact at a given point in time but recent memories of sound. This is important for perceiving sounds behind us. Very slight movements of the head back and forth cause ITDs that vary in tiny amounts (again, microseconds). The brain remembers the sound at one time, and compares it to the same sound at another time, which let's us perceive location better as the head moves around. 

Now this seems really complicated and that's true. But we can boil down the entire system of perception into a single equation called the Head Related transfer function (HRTF). The HRTF in signal processing theory is a time variant, nonlinear adaptive filter which makes the math rather unpleasant given its parameters depend on the sound source, the listener's head and ears, including the ear canal. But we can measure it by putting someone in an anechoic chamber, surrounding them by a spherical array of speakers with microphones in each ear canal. Then you sound off impulses from each speaker in the array and record the response, compile the data into a single function that can replicate the scenario on headphones (where the sound no longer interacts with the ear or head). 

My own research is on approximating the HRTF non invasively, the application is in virtual and augmented reality. It's a really hot topic in audio these days, especially because of how complicated it is!",1455206346,,czw3qrm,,t3_453chi,,,t3_453chi,,1458432618.0,2,,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,,1367451990.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,86697.0,,,,

I'm a PhD candidate in nanophotonics and one of the things my thesis aims to accomplish is to provide design guidelines to fabricate a nanophotonic phased array for visible light. 

A holographic display in the very literal sense would have to be a 3D screen. Like a little glass box filled with some sort of fluid sitting on your table. The base of this box would be your projector. To create a 3D hologram of a face, you'll have to carefully design your light sources such that at certain locations within the volume of the box, light will constructively interfere and therefore be visible to you. 

The light sources I'm talking about are antennas. Like you have antennas for radio and TV and cell phones, antennas can be made really small to work with visible wavelengths of light (telecom wavelengths begin at 1.3 um, where we use silicon photonics). Now, if you arrange thousands of these antennae in a 2D array, such that they're really, really close to each other, you can control the phase of the light from each light source (antenna) and therefore direct points in space where light will constructively interfere and other points where it will destructively interfere.

This means, if you can translate a 3D model into data that contains information about the required phase of light from each light source for every point in the projection volume, and you have a nanophotonic phased array, you have yourself a 3D holo TV. Now, the algorithm already exists in some sort. It's called the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm. I'm on my phone so I can't link to it. 

Also check out [Magic Leap](http://www.magicleap.com). It's a company working on augmented reality. They secured $600M in funding from Google amongst other investors. They have a slightly different approach to solving the problem, not so much into integrated photonics. 


Edit: [Prof. Watts' group](http://www.rle.mit.edu/pmg/phased-arrays/) at MIT managed to fabricate a silicon photonics based phased array which operates at a wavelength of 1.5 um.

I actually really like the idea of doing the heavy lifting in a distributed way: your own body processor figures out it's position and mesh/vector/shader data, perhaps centered on some kind of static locator beacon array and streams that to everyone in line of sight.

So any display that presents a hologram to you must actually have a light emitter directly behind or in front of the hologram itself for you to see it, because only then will the light come from the right direction to make your eyes see the virtual object. So unfortunately the star wars hologram which floats a few inches to the side of the projector (not directly in front of it) won't be a thing. The size of the projected object is limited by how large the emitter appears to you.

The good news is that putting the emitter right near your eyeballs means it appears very large and can simulate light from any direction, which is the idea behind head-mounted virtual reality and augmented reality devices. Eventually everyone will have AR glasses just like everyone has cell phones now, so we will be able to send each other holograms and feel like we're in a galaxy far far away as long as you're wearing the glasses.

IMO, this is the secret to solving many computationally difficult problems.  As a filmmaker currently working with computer vision and machine learning on an [augmented reality survival horror game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQsyr4QX-GU), I tend to avoid mathematical and statistical approaches when trying to solve complex signal/data problems opting instead for an experimental or ""outside the box"" approach that exploits outside information whenever I can.

On my current game, I spent over a year working on my single-camera depth-estimation system, and I've managed to achieve results with my fairly ""stupid"" non-mathematical approaches, where so many other smarter software engineers have failed.

So this mass defect cannot be augmented by putting the nuclei closer together. 

&gt;Any examples theoretically possible in reality?

Yes

&gt;Mass change = (unbound system calculated mass) − (measured mass of system)

&gt;i.e., (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) − (measured mass of nucleus) (Wikipedia yeah I know shame on me)


If you want mass change equal to the unbound system calculated mass then you need mesure mass of system to be 0. So you need the two particle combined to have zero mass. There's an example of that, it's matter and antimatter colliding. The energy didn't disappear it was radiated away in the form of heat and light.

&gt;Also what would the mass defect be for a black hole? e.g. if we squeeze a 1kg object into a BH, what would its mass be?)

You would have a 1kg black hole. By mass defect we mean that the mass changed form and became heat and light or change in velocity or some other kind of energy and subsequently escaped from the system. But in the case of a black hole, it cannot escape in the form of light. Nor heat AFAIK (pulled out of my ass but if it absorb what it touches and cannot radiate light waves, I don't see how it can cool). It could (again a guess from my ass) actually loose some mass in the form of a change in velocity but that would depend on the way you create the black hole. 

TLDR yes you can but not the way you think of it. It would mean the end product has no mass. Your black hole has probably 1kg

The gene pool is the key, which is what I was alluding to before. I was being oversimplistic to ascribe induced resistance to evolution. More specifically, I was referring to epigenetic expression, which is more likely how individual trees dip into their latent genetic material for an EAB solution. Just because they haven’t been exposed to this borer, doesn’t mean the gene pool hasn’t been exposed to similar disturbances in the past for which it evolved responses that have since been “dormant”, or unexpressed at the scale necessary for the species as a whole to withstand significant threats like EAB. Such genes do exist, foresters and academics are reporting them. 

So there’s no need to be so hopeless. Invasive species  are a significant disturbance to our ecosystems, among many more significant disturbances threatening the majority of life today. Our management techniques thus far either poison the environment and further disturb the ecological balance, or they fail to eradicate the botanical colonial oppression.

679,[],YourRapeyTeacher,,,[],,,,text,t2_jdifk,False,,"This is probably going to be pretty long but I’ve tried my best to answer your question, let me know if you have any follow up questions too.

I’ll use an example to show how the process works but many different fluorophores can be used as long as their excitation/emission spectra overlap. Recently many proteins have been engineered specifically for this purpose.

You may have heard of GFP (it’s pretty common in biology nowadays). This protein absorbs blue light and emits green light. There are two variants of this protein called the Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP).

CFP absorbs wavelengths of light around 414nm and emits light at around 475nm (light at this emission wavelength appears cyan in colour, hence the name). 

YFP absorbs wavelengths of light around 475nm of light and emits light around 525nm (light at this wavelength appears yellow).

As you can see YFP absorbs light around the same wavelength that CFP emits it. Through a process called Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) CFP can actually excite YFP but ONLY IF THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. There are many methods to study the interaction quantativley but that would take a lot more explanation and this is already going to be a pretty complicated answer so I thought I’d leave it out for now (let me know if you want that explained too).  This is a very useful tool to study protein interactions though, here’s another simple example to help explain.

Lets say you have a receptor which you think has an intercellular domain that’s cleaved off when a drug binds to the extracellular domain (this is fairly common). You know the sequence of the gene encoding the different subunits of the receptor. Using genetic engineering techniques you attach one of the fluorescent proteins to the receptor and one to the subunit you think will be cleaved off. You set up your FRET experiment and  add the drug which binds to the receptor, lets say you use light at 414nm for your initial excitation.

If the domain is not cleaved off then you will see yellow fluorescence. This is because the fluorophores are still close together so your light at 414nm excites the CFP which produces light at 475nm which excites the nearby YFP which produces yellow light (525nm).

If the domain is cleaved off then you will see cyan fluorescence. Your light at 414nm will excite the CFP to produce cyan fluorescence but there is no nearby YFP which means there will be no FRET and so no yellow light produced.

This is an extreme example but it shows the core mechanism. Machines can actually be used to measure much smaller changes in protein shape through changes in the fluorescent signal (these are the complex quantitive methods i touched on earlier), but the core principle remains the same.

BRET is a variation of FRET which uses a bioluminescent luciferase (usually) instead of external illumination to initiate the process. This helps reduce background noise to give a more accurate reading",1568450541,{},f071iax,False,t3_d2d8so,False,True,t3_d2d8so,/r/askscience/comments/d2d8so/can_someone_explain_to_me_in_great_detail_bret/f071iax/,1568450552.0,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer is super broad, but specific inheritable risk factors can theoretically be treated using CRISPR on embryos to combat childhood cancers (which are usually strongly driven by genetics). For someone who already has cancer, it is tougher to say.

Not sure which thyroid problems you mean. Hypothyroidism can have several causes with insufficient iodine/iodide in the diet being the most common.

691,[],crunchybiscuit,,,[],,,,text,t2_75t2q,False,,"A major reason for this is that as of now, we just don't have any good alternative to treating mental illness as disorders. It's a work in progress for sure, but we're a long way off from being able to make the kind of distinction in the ""broken leg vs. leg cancer"" case when it comes to the human brain. 

There are a few major reasons for this that don't really have easy solutions, other than ""we'll get there eventually, just hang on"". First, it's extraordinarily difficult to study mental illness as rigorously as other diseases as most samples you can get are postmortem. We can measure things like gross brain morphology with MRI/CAT scans, but gross morphology is both highly variable between individuals and very roughly correlated with specific problems. Some things, like lissencephaly, are very clear by structural analysis (the brain's surface doesn't have major grooves) and have been linked to specific causes (in that case, usually a mutation in genes regulating neuronal migration). 

But if we were to approach mental illness in a similar way, we'd end up with a set of structural ""symptoms"", such as ""larger lateral ventricles, smaller amygdalae, decreased white matter"" which is almost as nonspecific and less helpful than a set of interoceptive reports such as ""paranoia, hallucinations, depression"". On the level of detail we can achieve currently without invasive techniques, there are too many commonalities between disorders. And it would be pretty unethical (and illegal) to take the sample from a living patient for finer analysis, as losing the brain usually leads to death.

To add to that problem animal models just aren't that great for mental illness, as we can't ask a mutant mouse whether it's hallucinating, and behavioral testing is a very indirect way of interrogating animal interoception. This makes genetic studies very difficult.

Another issue that makes treating mental illness as something other than disorders difficult is that research suggests they are often polygenic, or may be caused by interactions between underlying genetic susceptibility and environment/experience. That makes pinning things down to the level of ""this is schizophrenia type 1A, this is type 2E, this is major depressive disorder"" based on genetic screening virtually impossible. It may be that there are so many variants of each condition that the same kind of specificity available to diseases like Charcot-Marie-Tooth (specific subsets with specific genetic causes) will never be viable for mental illness. 

It'd be great to be able to treat mental illnesses as distinct diseases with monolithic causes and develop specific unbiased tests for them, but we're not nearly there yet. We'll need to develop considerably better noninvasive diagnostic testing technology for it to be possible (which I can't really speak to, as I'm not in biomedical engineering), and biomedical research will just have to keep pushing forward (as it absolutely is).

However, this is a short-term high. Long-term economic growth is based on productivity and investment (capital and human). So arguments based on the ""virtuous cycle"" of consumer spending are misleading, and not good support for UBI. A better argument is that UBI will increase human capital investment.

2) *Inflation*. This argument against UBI is flawed. There may indeed be some upward pressure on prices, but in the long-term this is unlikely to be sustained.

705,,Baron_Von_Bullshit_,,,,,,,,t2_cjmp9,,,"The nature of work in America is headed somewhere we've never been before. It used to be that one person could work and support an entire family, but now families are in situations where 2 or 3 people work and still barely meet their needs. Automation is more of a problem than outsourcing and the current prediction is that automation will replace about 6% of current jobs within about 5 years. So that means fewer opportunities for millennials. 

Fewer jobs often means lower wages as people are more easily replaced and willing to take jobs at lower wages. Specialized training is going to be a necessity if you want a career. Part of the problem is that unpaid internships have become an accepted norm which is unprecedented as far as I know.  But this lowers wages and hurts our economy as young people in particular are often living in poverty and can't afford to spend money on consumption (e.g. going to the movies/out for dinner). 

Millennials need to realize that their work is actually valuable and not just work for the sake of working. It's actually terrible for our economy to accept underpayment for work because it restricts job availability, and slows down consumption which is 70% of our GDP. One of the best things that happened to labor in the past century was when Henry Ford adopted a shorter work-week with higher pay. People used to work 6 days a week 60 hours a week, but innovations made that unnecessary. Today, and in the future, automation, computers, the internet, etc. have made us so much more efficient that we really don't need to work as much as we do, but the average person doesn't understand that. 

Millennials are going to be in for a tough job market as far as estimates go. The best thing might be to implement a universal basic income. Doing this would allow people to meet their basic needs such as food, housing etc, without working. Those who want a higher amount of income can still go out and work, but those who are satisfied living with their basic needs met will be able to pursue passions and utilize their creativity, as people will be able to pursue arts without fear of starvation. Unfortunately America is usually the last to implement these types of socialist economic reforms, so don't hold your breath. We'll probably stick with the 40 hour work week for far longer than it is useful.

The problem is, with automation, work is going to become less necessary, but the 40 hour work-week is essentially embedded into our healthcare laws and other essentials. From my perspective the future is somewhat bleak unless there is a fundamental change in American's views towards work.

2. re: triffin dilemma - is it possible for a central bank to take on the burden of serving its citizenry as well as the world's demands for a reserve currency?

3. is it inevitable that we'll go towards a basket of currencies internationally or a supranational currency (keynes' proposed bancor?)

4. is the federal reserve comparable to a monarchy; hey it's good as long as we have a 'good' king...  but fundamentally should a market be serving this purpose?

5. has a currency board been attempted?  iirc greenspan proposed twiddling rates around a gold based currency board attempting to simply keep the price of gold stable in that currency.

6. gold seems derided by many in modern economics - yet if it has no purpose or if bernanke's 'tradition' was simply it, why aren't central banks selling all their gold (at the agreed upon rate)?

7. not only that, but why are they doing the opposite?  ie. central banks have been net buyers of gold for several years.

8. in the US we have both the earned income tax credit (EITC) and fed/state minimum wages.  also welfare (food stamps and such).  politically unacceptable here but other models might be universal basic income or a system with no minimum wage but many strong union set minimum wages (like sweden).  is EITC not vastly superior to a minimum wage?  aren't all of these approaches superior, in that all other approaches can be funded from taxes (up to 100% from 'the rich') without disturbing the labor market or pushing any wage inflation onto consumers (including middle and lower classes)?

9. it seems some areas of the US have had success implementing instant run off voting (mayor of minneapolis iirc was recently elected this way) - which seems a huge threat to the 2-party system - how did this get passed on through?  how can we do it more places?

709,,evaporatify,,,,,,,,t2_9ed46,,,"Probably the biggest difference between the United States and the Nordics is the idea of a universal welfare state, which all the Nordics currently employ and hold in great value. In this model, there is an extensive social safety net that safeguards individuals in case they might go through a rough patch; generally, the idea is that the state exists to serve and support the individual instead of the other way around, which sometimes seems to be the case in the United States. Often dubbed as the Nordic model, it encompasses...

* **Welfare system.** The state provides you with basic security (food, clothing, housing, healthcare etc.), social insurance (several kinds of insurance programs are enforced; you receive benefits for participating; for example, retirement, disability, and unemployment insurances), and essential services (financial support during sickness, unemployment, retirement etc.). This is all funded by tax revenue.
* **Redistribution of wealth.** The more you earn, the more you pay. The taxation system ensures that the revenue goes from those who don't need as much to those who do. And this is done in a huge scale. Additionally, personal taxes are higher than in the United States, while corporate taxes are lower. This keeps income inequality in control.
* **Very high public spending.** The government expenditure is around 50 % of GDP. A large part of this goes to education and healthcare. The state also has many subsidies across several industries.
* **Large number of public employees.** Around ⅓ of the workforce is employed by the public sector. This is probably why public expenditure is as high as it is.
* **Mixed economy.** Both the state and the private sector guide the economy; the government prefers a moderately laissez-faire economy (free trade and collective risk sharing are encouraged, and the government maintains social programs and labor institutions), while still maintaining a strong regulatory oversight.
* **Free education and universal healthcare.** Though the systems differ between countries, all Nordics offer free education (this means no tuition fees for all levels of education; books and other equipment won't be provided for after primary / comprehensive school) as well as publicly funded healthcare (though private establishments exist).
* **High labor union membership.** Across the Nordics, around 50 - 70 % of the entire workforce belongs to a union. Compare to 12 % in the United States and 17 % OECD average. 
* **High degree of cooperation between employer and employee unions and the state.** The three parties negotiate the regulations regarding labor and workplaces instead of the state doing this all by itself through law (or enforcing nothing at all). 
* **Low levels of corruption.** While I don't know why exactly this is, transparency is outright demanded of the government. One good guess could be the fact that the governments are directly responsible to the parliaments, and thus, to the people. Additionally, individuals have access to all (or nearly all, varying by country) public records.

These are a few points. It's worth debating *why* exactly these are the things the Nordics follow, but they seem to work. As the Economist put it, the government isn't popular because it's big, but because it works. The populace is quite practical. And while the state keeps a rather tight leash on things it doesn't directly control, the public keeps an even tighter leash on the state.

While in America the Nordics might be perceived as socialist, this is actually somewhat inaccurate; the more fitting term could be [social democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy) (which is a lot different), although Sweden and Finland have shifted to the right side of the political spectrum in recent years (after having a social democratic majority for decades).

For more reading, you should check [the Economist articles](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/19a8cd/why_do_scandinavian_countries_rate_so_high_on/c8mec73) /u/Ampersand55 posted and the Wikipedia article on the [Nordic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model). [Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=nordic+model) could also provide some worthwhile articles.

**Edit:** Possible downsides of the Nordic model include the fact that the public spending, while beneficially high, is in fact too high for sustainable growth. Taxation on corporations, while lower than in the United States, is still rather harsh on young companies and starting entrepreneurs. And, as is probably expected, the welfare system can be *too* caring; there are probably a lot of people living on benefits that shouldn't really be doing that.

Why other countries haven't done it yet? There is notable movement within several countries that want to reform the state according to the Nordics. Obviously there is opposition, but the general notion appears to be that the Nordics work (yeah, just ask reddit), but once such movements get big enough, I believe we'll see some changes. The biggest difficulty will probably be discarding the old orthodoxical conceptions you have of the political spectrucm; both left and right in the Nordics share the same view on egalitarianism, democracy, and to some degree, liberalism (the social kind).

**Edit ii:** All the information comes from what I've personally come across in newspapers and the like (native Finn), so excuse me for the lack of sources. I believe OECD has data on all the points provided should anyone be interested on the correct and up-to-date ones (Wikipedia too, probably).",1361939005,,c8mezc3,,t3_19a8cd,,,t3_19a8cd,,1431423331.0,738,,,,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,1361950637.0,1351098363.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,23972.0,,,False,
710,[],YaztromoX,,computing,[],,Systems Software,dark,text,t2_ngsr1,False,,"Finding an answer to a problem and verifying that the answer is correct can often have two different levels of algorithmic runtime complexity.  For certain classes of problems, it can be much more difficult to find a solution than it is to test to see if the solution works.  Solving the problem may require an exhaustive scan of the full search space, but verifying the solution may just require testing it against the problem constraints to ensure it's a valid solution.

For example, take a look at the [Battleship Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(puzzle\)).  This is a single player puzzle version of the classic two-player game, wherein you are presented with an empty game grid along with a series of values along each grid axis indicating how many ""ship"" cells can be seen along its associated row or column ([here is an online version you can play to see what I'm talking about](https://lukerissacher.com/battleships)).  Solving this puzzle via a full and exhaustive search would be (relatively) hard: given an _n_ by _m_ sized grid, the computer would need to generate 2^n*m board configurations^0.  However, to validate the solution to this problem only requires that you check that the number of marked squares in the solution matches the numbers in the axes, which would only require _n + m_ tests.  So if we have a 100 by 100 game board, the full search space is going to be an astronomical 2 * 10^3010, whereas testing that a given solution is correct is only going to require 200 row/column comparisons.

The Battleship Puzzle is an example of a problem called _NP-Complete_ ^1.  NP (and NP-Complete) problems all exhibit the traits that they are very difficult to solve, but the solutions are easy to validate.

The paper on Google Sycamore has been taken offline^2, however from a [summary I found](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2217347-google-claims-it-has-finally-reached-quantum-supremacy/) it appears that the test being conducted was a random sampling problem.  Without further details from the paper itself it's difficult to comment on the testing or validation^3, as the type of random sampling problem mentioned in the linked summary has a variety of different solution aspects, and I have no idea which ones were being run.  As it was just a test, it may be that formal validation hasn't been undertaken in this case.  More will be known once the paper has been made public.

HTH!

^0 -- of course, we typically don't solve problems by doing a full and exhaustive search; we usually stop when we find a valid solution.

714,[],shavera,,physics,[],,Strong Force | Quark-Gluon Plasma | Particle Jets,dark,text,t2_4ntj6,False,,"I think it's easiest to think of entanglement in how it's used in quantum computing: Entanglement is information that is stored not in one particle or the other, but in the *correlation* between them.

The classic example is one particle with 0 angular momentum creating two particles with non-zero angular momentum (called spin). We know that angular momentum must be conserved, so whatever the particles' spin are, they have to cancel each other out so that the system of them has 0 angular momentum. We can choose to measure the spin along the 'z-axis' (let's say that's vertical), and say that if the spin is counterclockwise (so angular momentum as a vector points 'up') it's a spin-up particle and if clockwise, spin-down.

So far if I send you one of the particles and you measure it, you'll get spin up or down with equal chance, and I haven't actually sent you any information, since it's all random. What I *can* do, is to flip my particle upside-down. I must stress here what emphatically **does not happen** is that your particle, half a universe away, magically flips itself over to adjust to my flipping. Your particle, as best we can measure, stays exactly the way it is. So now we know that both of our particles are spin-up or spin-down, not knowing which.

Now if you measure your particle you'll still get spin-up or spin-down with random chance, and you still don't actually have any information. I have to message you in some classical way (we'll say I call you on the phone to put ourselves in the mindset of the scientists first working on this problem). Let's say you measure spin up. I call you up and say I've measured spin-down. ***Now*** you know that I have not flipped my particle. Now you have information. Your information comes not in the measurement you make, or the measurement I made, but in the correlation between the two measurements.

There's more I can do than just flip my particle. I can rotate it 90 degrees around the X axis, or 90 degrees around the Y axis (to simplify the description here, it's a bit more mathy under the hood). Those moves encode a value called phase which we won't discuss here. The point being that the particles can be 'in-phase' or 'out-of-phase'. So I can send you a message that I've measured 'down' and 'out-of-phase' and you measure yours to be 'down' and 'in-phase' so you know which of the 4 rotations (including no rotation at all) I've performed. So you actually get two bits of information in our entangled pair of particles

Why all the drama for something so simple? Well it turns out, I've kept things simple using 'spin' as our entangled state. There are only 2 states 'up' or 'down'. But the message I send to you allows you to get one of 4 messages. It turns out, different quantum systems with more states allow for more message packing. If my system has 3 states, I can send 9 messages, 4 states, 16 and so on. We call this 'Dense Quantum Encoding'. Packing more bits of information into fewer particles. It also turns out that if someone intercepts either one of our lines, my results or the particle I send to you to measure, they cannot get the message I sent you. If they intercept both lines, the physical interaction they perform on the particle I send to you becomes detectable on your end, because it will destroy the entangled information. After some number of particles you can detect there's an eavesdropper, and we can shut down communications, creating a communication system very robust to 'man-in-the-middle' attacks.

If you are interested in what entanglement is, see above. If you'd not like to be confused by what it is not, skip what follows.

So obviously you've heard about all kinds of ""spooky action at a distance"" and how Einstein ""hated"" entanglement or other such popular journalism nonsense about entanglement. What's that all about then? Well let's go back to our initial problem. I stated that particles come out either spin up or spin down but we don't know which. Let's imagine that there was actually some other state, some variable we cannot measure in any way. This state encodes whether the particle ""really is"" spin up or down. Even with the examples I've provided above, flipping 90 or 180 degrees, there still isn't anything particularly peculiar yet. 

However, if I only rotate my particle 5 degrees, what happens? Due to maths I don't wish to get into here, if this hidden variable *does* pre-determine spin up or down, and no information, not even information in this hidden sector, can travel faster than light, we would expect that the probability of measuring both particles anti-aligned (one up one down) is linearly proportional to the number of degrees rotated. 0 degrees, 100%, 180 degrees, 0%, 18 degrees, 90% and so on. However, when we actually perform this measurement, we find that the probability actually varies by the cosine of the degrees rotated, not linearly. 

Again, due to maths I don't care to get into, this means (at least) one of our assumptions is false: maybe there's no hidden variable after all, maybe information can travel faster than light. This is the end of the scientific commentary on the subject. Since we, by definition, can't measure the hidden sector, and science is only in the business of predicting the results of experiments based on the results of previous ones, we can't scientifically go further down this road.

But philosophically, here's where we arrive.  Since the hidden sector is not measurable, then it doesn't create any weird time paradoxes for us to allow information to travel faster than light in that sector. No ""real"" information is faster than light, nothing we can 'really' send a message in. So some people like to believe that underneath quantum mechanics, there's some other system of 'real' variables and everything has some 'real' truth that our measurements simply tease out indirectly.

Alternatively, we can say that nothing else we know of can travel faster than light, we know there are problems with time paradoxes with information traveling faster than light, and so on. So maybe the thing that's wrong is the assumption that there must be some 'real' variable that tells the particle how to behave in a measurement. Maybe when the particles are created they are created in a true superposition of states. They really are both up and down at the same time, not definitively one case or the other. And when we measure we can only measure one state or the other. This, of course, leads to the question of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics: what does ""actually"" happen when we measure a superposition of states and then the particle is only in whatever state we've measured after we measure it? 

To be clear on my bias in the last two paragraphs, I am mostly a 'shut up and calculate' physicist when it comes to the physical part of the problem. It honestly does not matter which description is true, the science of the problem tells us that we cannot have both 'realism' (hidden variables) and 'locality' (information only travels at c or slower), often called 'local realism.' If I am being philosophical, I am more in the camp of keeping locality and discarding realism. I say this not to say that I am right or you should take my opinion more seriously than someone else, only that I am likely to have biased how I worded those paragraphs in favor of the opinion I have, so take them with an appropriate grain of salt.",1568977891,{},f0vdsoz,False,t3_d6m175,False,True,t3_d6m175,/r/askscience/comments/d6m175/what_actually_is_particle_entanglement_in_simple/f0vdsoz/,1568977892.0,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We see real numbers pop up more frequently because they help us quantify measure and scale. Of particular importance is multiplication for real numbers; if you take a (positive) real number r and see what it does to every real number then you will find that it zooms the number line in and out. Which has obvious direct applications, eg proportionality.

For complex numbers, multiplication is just as important but more powerful. In a similar way to real number, multiplication by complex numbers will scale things up/down, but it also *rotates* the complex plane. Rotation is super important and complex numbers are important because their arithmetic is intimately tied with rotation. They arise in more complicated contexts, because rotation + scale is more complicated than just scale, but they do arise as ""just as real"" as real numbers. For instance, quantum mechanical systems are quantified using complex numbers and how they interact as ""real"" things depends on the ""rotational scale"" between them. We could (probably) do all of planar trigonometry with complex numbers instead of sine and cosine we just happened to develop it without complex numbers first. Though there are applications where they do act as middlemen to avoid complications with trigonometry and to take advantage of the many powerful tools associated to complex numbers.

-------------------------------------

As for Complex Angle, yes you can. In case you have not heard, there is the notion of ""Hyperbolic Trigonometry"", which does to hyperbolas what trigonometry does with circles. To understand this, we need to know a bit about regular circular trigonometry.

The notion of an ""angle"" in circular trigonometry is usually defined using arclength. If you have an angle, draw a circle of radius R centered at the point of intersection of the angle, then find the arclength L along this circle from the first line in the angle to the second. The angle is defined as T=L/R. Because all circles are similar, this number does not depend on the radius of the circle you chose. This is how it is *usually* done. But we actually don't want this. Instead, we want to define it using area. If we have the same angle and circle, then instead of computing the arclength, we can compute the area of the wedge of the circle defined by this angle, A. There is a relationship between this area and the angle as usually computed, namely A =TR^(2)/2, and this means we can actually use this area to *define* what an angle is. So we define the angle of an intersection to be T= 2A/R^(2), where A is the area of the circular sector made by the angle. Note that when R=1, we just have that T is twice the area of this sector (note, again, that since circles are similar, this value does not depend on the radius chosen).

With this notion of an angle, we are able to ""parameterize"" the entire circle. For every angle T between 0 and 2pi, there is a unique point on the circle given by x^(2)+y^(2)=1. We call this unique point (cos(T),sin(T)), which is where cosine and sine come from. It turns out that, since angles have nice properties, you get things like the angle addition formula, etc.

We can play a similar game, but with hyperbolas. The hyperbola of ""radius"" R is given by the equation x^(2) - y^(2) = R^(2) and we'll view this ""centered"" at the origin. This hyperbola has two pieces to it, but we'll just concern ourselves with the righthand portion of it. If we have a point on this hyperbola, then we can draw a line from it to the origin. We also have the line along the x-axis from the origin to the hyperbola at (R,0). These two lines form an intersection and, with the hyperbola itself, bound an area that is a ""hyperbolic sector"", which has some area A, and we define the hyperbolic angle associated with this intersection, S, to be the value S = 2A/R^(2), just like with the circle. As before, this value only depends on the intersection, not the ""radius"" of the hyperbola. So, when R=1, we have S=2A.

Just as above, for every real number S, we can find a unique point on the (right portion of the) hyperbola whose hyperbolic angle is S. So on the ""unit hyperbola"" x^(2)-y^(2)=1, given an S, there is a point on it corresponding to this S that we all (cosh(S), sinh(S)). Since hyperbolic angles have nice properties, you get things like the hyperbolic angle addition formula, etc.

So we have two notions of ""angle"" and two different versions of the trigonometric functions to go along with them. It turns out that these idea can be unified using the notion of ""complex angles"". It turns out that these two kinds of trigonometric/hyperbolic functions are just weird manifestations of exponentiation, as long as we look at the complex plane. There is the famous [Euler Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) which gives us

* cos(T) = (e^(iT) + e^(-iT))/2

* sin(T) = (e^(iT) - e^(-iT))/2i

There is also the hyperbolic version of this:

* cosh(S) = (e^(S) + e^(-S))/2

* sinh(S) = (e^(S) - e^(-S))/2

This is *usually* just given to you as what the hyperbolic trig functions *are*, which is a shame because the link to the hyperbola is gone and it's just a dumb formula. But there's [really nice geometric proofs of this formula for hyperbolic functions](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/757091/alternative-definition-of-hyperbolic-cosine-without-relying-on-exponential-funct/757241#757241).

Notice some similarities between these. Note that it kinda looks like cos(T)=cosh(iT) and similarly for sine. In a way, it looks like the circular angle is an *imaginary* hyperbolic angle. So we've been working with imaginary angles all this time! These relationships, along with the addition formulas, can allow us to define trig functions that input complex angles. Particularly, we can define C(x+iy) and S(x+iy) as follows:

* C(x+iy) = cosh(x)cos(y) + i\*sinh(x)sin(y)

* S(x+iy) = sinh(x)cos(y) + i\*cosh(x)sin(y)

Note that

* C(x) = cosh(x)    and    C(iy) = cos(y)

* S(x) = sinh(x)   and   S(iy) = i\*sin(y)

so we, essentially, get all the trig and hyperbolic functions back from this where ""real"" angles are hyperbolic angles and ""imaginary"" angles are trig angles. You can also check that the angle addition formula holds for S(z) and C(z) (in the form of the hyperbolic angle addition formulas). So, these are functions that naturally generalize the trig and hyperbolic functions and can input any *complex* value as their angle.

So what? What's good or useful or geometric about this? It turns out that there is an important geometric interpretation for these guys. Before, we were looking at the circle and hyperbola as the solutions to x^(2)+y^(2)=1 and x^(2)-y^(2)=1 respectively. Intuitively, then, since these new functions contain *both* of the ordinary trig functions, they should, in some way, help us parameterize some kind of geometric object that has both a circle and a hyperbola in it. And that's exactly what they do!

Consider the solutions to the equation z^(2) - w^(2) = 1 where, now, we are interested in any *complex* values solution. So, for instance, (0,i) is a point on this thing. In fact, note that (cos(T),i\*sin(T)) is always going to be a point on this thing. This means that, whatever this thing is, it has the unit circle in it. On the other hand, note that (cosh(S),sinh(S)) are also solutions to this thing, and so it *also* contains the unit hyperbola on it. It turns out that the geometric object that z^(2)-w^(2)=1 gives us is a one-sheeted [Hyperboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid). The unit circle is the circle at the cinch and the hyperbola is the profile of it. Even more, though, for every complex number z, the point (C(z),S(z)) is a point on this hyperboloid and, finally, given any point on this hyperboloic there is a complex angle z (unique if you restrict the imaginary part to between -ipi and ipi) so that the point is given by this complex angle. So even ""mixed"" angles like 3 + ipi/2 is defines a point on some place in between the circle and hyperbola.

(We sometimes call this hyperboloid a ""Complex Hyperbola"" since it uses the same formula as a hyperbola but we look for complex solutions. But we could just as easily call it a ""Complex Circle"" because when we try to use the circle equation z^(2)+w^(2)=1, then we automatically get a point on the hyperbolic one since z^(2)+w^(2)=z^(2)-(iw)^(2)=1. In other words, in the complex world, there is no difference between circles and hyperbolas.)

**TL;DR** Yes! There are complex angles. The corresponding complex trigonometric functions that use them generalize circular and hyperbolic geometry, and correspond, geometrically, to a ""Hyperboloid"".",1563482276,{},eu5p4mt,False,t3_cevvpg,False,True,t3_cevvpg,/r/askscience/comments/cevvpg/is_there_complex_angles_and_is_there_application/eu5p4mt/,1563482277.0,64,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,1563568675.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Otherwise I'll do my best here: Quantum systems isolated from their environment exist in superpostions of multiple possible states. When they interact with their environment the odds rise that this pure state will collapse into one of those possible states described by a probability amplitude. An example is the classical vs quantum view of the electron; in the classical picture the electron is like a tiny ball orbiting the nucleus of an atom like a moon around a planet. While this is still somewhat useful for basic chemistry, it turns out to be fundamentally incorrect. 
Here is the Hydrogen atom as classical mechanics saw it: http://electron6.phys.utk.edu/phys250/modules/module%203/images/hydrog3.gif

This how QM sees the electron around a hydrogen atom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom#/media/File:HAtomOrbitals.png

Those shadings represent, not exact positions but the probability densities of the electron; the odds of finding it in a given ""region"" as a heat graph (brighter = more likely). 

For a *really* simple and slightly deceptive example of superpositions that nonetheless lends itself to a simple answer is this: imagine a perfect, idealized playing card on a perfectly flat surface, and ignore all forces except gravity. Place that playing card *precisely* on its edge. Now classical mechanics says it has a 50-50 chance of falling in either direction, right? That's pretty straightforward, and you can sit around and watch it happen. 

QM says something weird instead: if the card is isolated from any outside influences, any correlations with its environments (that includes us trying to measure it since that would involve interacting with it) it exists in a simultaneous state of falling to *both* sides. Only when (as it's commonly stated) it's observed will it be in one state or the other. 

This leads to reasonable questions: Why the hell? Why does that happen? How does it happen? Why would nature prefer me to see it fall one way over another if it's 50-50 either way and it exists in a state of both outcomes? Where does the outcome I don't see go exactly? 

This is the realm of interpretation of QM, and you've probably heard of at least one solution to the problem: multiverse theory. The idea there is that nature doesn't choose, doesn't ""play dice"" as Einstein said. Instead we exist in one of an arbitrary number of universes, and although we can only ever observe our own branch, there is no preference for outcomes. In other words the card really *does* fall both ways, it's just that as people bound to one set of outcomes it looks like it only falls one way. 

On a less simplistic level, people want to know exactly where the line between quantum weirdness like superpositions or entanglement end (with all of its probabilities instead of certain outcomes) and where our classical world begins. After all, we *never* see things in superpositions in our daily lives, we don't randomly fall through the floor because of random fluctuations. Why is that? 

Other than multiverses, there are lots of other ideas, the oldest being ""Wavefunction collapse"". That says, essentially, that nature really does play dice; when you observe a system the ""cloud"" of probability amplitudes settles on a final state and the rest just disappear. That's not terribly satisfying, but then nature never promised satisfaction. 

Decoherence (here we finally come to the answer to your question) is another way of looking at this process of the quantum becoming classical. Instead of the wavefunction just collapsing, instead of universes we can never detect, this theory is gradual. There is no precise limit, but as correlations with the environment grow the quantum system loses coherence and becomes classical. There is some evidence to support this, as objects made of ensembles of atoms (a nanoscale tuning fork in one notable case) and kept very close to absolute zero have been placed in a superposition and observed.

That puzzle is ""Given a certain input, with part of the input variable, part of it fixed, find a value for the variable part such that the full input after 2 applications of SHA256 returns a value smaller than the target value"".

Most non-cryptocurrency applications of SHA256 and other hashing functions depend on the exact value of the outcome of the function. For example, when I use SHA256 to verify the integrity of a downloaded file, I compute the SHA256 hash and compare it to the one provided by the sender of the file. Only an exact match will do.

Breaking SHA256 (or any other hash function) typically involves solving the puzzle ""Given an input X, find a second input Y that has the same SHA256 value"" or the puzzle ""Given an output A, find an input X such that SHA256(X) = A"" (along with some variations to this theme).

ASICs are too rigid in their design to allow them to deviate from their design purpose. A Bitcoin mining ASIC won't be usable for cracking SHA256. FPGAs and GPUs are programmable devices (programmable in different ways), so they could in principle be used programmed to attack SHA256 cryptography. But the work that was done to optimize SHA256 computations for Bitcoin purposes won't really help with other attacks.

It's basically the same as non-elliptic-curve diffie-hellman, but it's over a different [group](http://www.quadibloc.com/math/abaint.htm) instead of the integers-modulo-N.

Take RSA, since it's simple to explain. The keypair is set up so that e^(ED) ≡ e (mod N, forall e), so if I send you M^E it's easy for you to calculate M^(ED) = M.

If you do that with plain old integers, instead of integers-mod-N, it's not a very secure system, because we can take logarithms. (Also, there's no D that makes e^(ED) = e if you're using normal integers, minor detail) But if you do it modulo-N, then the math still works, and the modulo operation effectively scrambles the intermediate values so that it's really hard to do some operations (like logarithms) while still being easy to do others (like multiplication).

Elliptic-curve-points-over-finite-fields are like integers-modulo-N, in this case. You can think of it as an even more elaborate way of twisting up a number-line so that the only things you know how to do any more are addition (and multiplication-by-a-scalar). There's much less visible ""structure"" to the numbers than there is for the integers, which means there are far fewer mathematical tools for reversing a one-way function, which means you can use a much smaller key for the same amount of security.

The link between the two is the general field of abstract algebra — the idea that if you have a pile of things and relationships between them that *act like* addition, multiplication, and so on, that you can treat them a lot like integers, but they might have other interesting properties (or else they'd just be new names for the integers).",1527205541,,dzj4j3q,False,t3_8lvt9g,,True,t3_8lvt9g,/r/askscience/comments/8lvt9g/cryptocurrency_nerds_in_layman_terms_how_does/dzj4j3q/,1527925451.0,12,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,1527205751.0,1371009593.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,12419.0,,public,False,

753,,Rannasha,,physics,,,Computational Plasma Physics,,,,,,"&gt; I think I get it - so ""mining"" is really ""processing ongoing transactions""? How does the program know what the next block hash looks like? If you have previous hash and next hash, isn't it kind of straightforward to get the answer to that?

In a nutshell, mining involves taking a set of transactions and computing a special number that identifies that specific set (the so-called hash of the Merkle root, this number doesn't uniquely identify a particular set of transactions, but finding another set with the same Merkle root hash is effectively impossible). The miner then takes this number, the hash of the last valid block in the chain and some other data (including a field that the miner can fill with arbitrary data, the ""nonce"") and combines it into what is called the ""block header"". The miner runs the block header through a hash function and the output is a large number. If this number is smaller than a certain value (the ""target""), then this block is valid and the miner can broadcast it.

If the hash of the block header is not smaller than the target, the miner will update some of the fields in the header, such as the nonce, but potentially also the timestamp or even the Merkle root (if the miner decides to add and/or remove transactions) and tries again. This process repeats until the miner finds a hash of the block header that is low enough or until some other miner does so.

At that point, the miner validates the new block, he will check which transactions are present in the new block and remove those transactions from the list of unconfirmed transactions. The miner will then assemble a new set of transaction to be included and the process starts anew.

&gt; And speaking of blocks and block chain - won't it get impossibly big the more people use it? Is there something in place to solve this problem?

Yes, this is a problem. At the current rate, 1 MB per 10 minutes, the Bitcoin blockchain grows more slowly than the average consumer harddisk, so it's not a problem now. But if more and more people start to use Bitcoin (and the 1 MB limit is raised), it will become an issue. This is not unique to Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies have the same problems (although they may not be apparent if they have very few users).

Note that many users already use a ""light wallet"", which instead of maintaining a full record of the entire blockchain, queries other nodes about the addresses it is interested in. This means that light wallets don't have any requirements on storage space, but they rely on other nodes for validation of transaction data.

For so-called ""full nodes"", there are a number of possible solutions. One is called ""pruning"". Most users/nodes don't need the full transaction history to operate. Indeed, it is sufficient to just know the current state of the ledger: Who has how much? That means that in a transaction chain A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D only the last transaction, C-&gt;D, has to be kept and the rest may be discarded.

However, there must always be some nodes that keep the full, unpruned blockchain because new nodes must have a way to verify the current state of the ledger by replaying its history.

Finally, future use of cryptocurrency will likely leverage ""off-chain"" transaction systems, that rely on the same cryptography that powers Bitcoin &amp; co, but without broadcasting every single transaction to the blockchain.

An important example are the so-called payment channels or lightning networks. Two users that wish to transact can each commit a certain amount of coins to open a payment channel by creating and submitting a special transaction. At this point, the coins committed are locked. Each time the users transact, the sender signs an update version of their joint ""tab"" and sends it to the other. This can be done as often as they want and at any point either of the two parties can submit the tab to the blockchain as a special transaction, after which the net transacted amount is settled, the appropriate amounts of coins are returned and the channel is closed. An example would be grocery shopping: At the start of the week you open a channel with your supermarket and you commit $100 worth of Bitcoin, while the supermarket commits zero. Each day, you buy a few items and your wallet application sends the supermarket an updated tab. After day 1, that may contain $90 for you and $10 for the supermarket, if you purchased for $10. Eventually, you close the channel and the supermarket gets its coins. The supermarket also has the option to close the channel, for example after a certain amount of time has expired.

While this may appear marginally useful in cases where you frequently transact with the same party, the true strength of lightning networks lie in the fact that channels between different parties can be linked to create a mesh network. If I open a channel with you and you open a channel with the supermarket, I can create lightning network payments to the supermarket that pass through you (provided you're online). All of this is fully trustless: I don't have to trust you or the supermarket, because every party involved is able to verify the validity of these transactions by themselves using cryptography.

Proper implementation of such technologies in Bitcoin require a modification to the protocol. This modification, with the rather cryptic name ""Segregated Witness"" or ""SegWit"" is due to activate on the Bitcoin network later today.",1503488964,,dm0f6cj,False,t3_6vdbdp,,,t1_dm0cd6b,,,5,,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,,,True,False,,,,,,,,,

This type of event is theoretical for Bitcoin, due to the very large amount of money required for (and wasted by) such an action, given all the hardware that would be required. However, for many alternative cryptocurrencies, it's a reality.

What happens is that there are many so-called ""altcoins"" that use different mining algorithms that are still best run on GPUs. There are mining collectives called ""pools"" that determine which altcoin is the most profitable to mine, by looking at difficulty and exchange rate and all miners in the pool switch to that coin.

After the difficulty adjusts to this influx of new miners, the profitability goes down and the pool with its miners switches to a different altcoin. For some of the smaller altcoins, these automatically switching pools make up far more mining power than the baseline power on that coins network. So the pool leaving the coin after the difficulty has adjusted for it, puts the coin in a situation where it is stuck for a long time until the next adjustment.

To combat this, most smaller altcoins have adopted alternative difficulty adjustment strategies. Often given fancy names (""Kimoto Gravity Well"" for example), these essentially adjust the difficulty based on the very recent history, rather than looking back 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) that Bitcoin does.

Bitcoin doesn't need these things because it requires very specialized hardware and it is the only major cryptocurrency to use this algorithm, so there's no real risk of a large amount hashing power dropping in and disappearing shortly thereafter.",1497910193,,dj4jp5a,,t3_6i1vkx,,,t1_dj3ywib,,1499488026.0,5,,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,,1357482226.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,3.0,22772.0,,,,
755,,Rannasha,,physics,,,Computational Plasma Physics,,,t2_a4fbm,,,"No. For two main reasons.

First of all, Bitcoin mining started out using CPUs. They're in every computer and they can do pretty much any computational task reasonably effective, but they don't really excel in anything. Then people figured out that graphics cards (or specifically, GPUs) are very well suited to doing the same computation on different data. A GPU contains a large number of simple processors and can perform certain tasks extremely quickly, but is essentially useless for others. Originally, GPUs were made to be good at generating 3D graphics for games, but people figured out that other types of computations also work very well with the specific architecture of a GPU. One example is Bitcoin mining. The performance of a modest GPU is much higher than that of a high-end CPU, so miners switched over to using GPUs in large numbers (so much so that the preferred models were often sold out).

But, people reasoned that while GPUs are much more efficient, they're still somewhat general purpose chips. What if you'd design a chip purely for Bitcon mining. And this is what was done. Such a single-purpose chip is called an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) and ASIC-miners were again a big step up in efficiency. I have a small USB device that cost me about $20 and uses 5W in power that is as effective at mining as a midrange GPU at the time I bought it.

By now, the entire Bitcoin network uses these ASICs for mining. They're so efficient that if you would pile up the top 500 supercomputers in the world and put them all to work on Bitcoin mining, they wouldn't outperform the current stack of mining hardware. Because of this, some Bitcoin-supporters like to claim that the Bitcoin network is more powerful than all the supercomputers in the world combined. But this is a bit disingenuous, since supercomputers are rather versatile and suitable for a wide range of workloads, where a Bitcoin-miner does only 1 thing.

So, if someone with a single supercomputer would start mining Bitcoin, they wouldn't make dent in the network.

And now for the second reason, which is much more fundamental. Because you could imagine (even though it's not particularly realistic) that some organization would secretly create or buy a large stack of ASIC-miners and switch them all on all of the sudden. But even then they wouldn't be able to mine all the bitcoins at once.

Bitcoin-mining (and mining for pretty much every other cryptocurrency) revolves around an important parameters: The difficulty. This parameter determines how much computational power is needed, on average, to find a new block and therefore new bitcoins. In Bitcoin, this parameter is updated every 2016 blocks and this update is done by looking at the time it took to mine the previous batch of 2016 blocks and then set the difficulty parameter in such a way that if mining power remains the same, the next set of 2016 blocks will take 2 weeks (average of 10 minutes per block).

If the mining power on the network would suddenly jump by a large amount, the rate at which blocks are mined and bitcoins are created would temporarily spike up, but the next time a cycle of 2016 blocks has been completed, the difficulty would go up accordingly and the rate at which new blocks are mined would go down again. Depending on when in the 2016 block cycle the increase in mining power begins, it may take 2 cycles to properly adjust for it, but this takes a few weeks at most (and the greater the sudden increase is, the faster the cycle is completed, so the sooner the difficulty adjustment is).

So those are the two main reasons. First, the hardware being used is specifically designed and built for Bitcoin mining. Unless you have the same type of equipment, you won't be able to compete. Secondly, the protocol was designed to adjust to changes in the network mining power. A large increase will see a sudden speed up, but this'll get corrected relatively quickly.",1497857918,,dj3ja29,,t3_6i1vkx,,,t3_6i1vkx,,1499470384.0,21,,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,,1357482226.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,39798.0,,,,

It is believed by many scientists that NP-complete problems are just as difficult for quantum computers to solve as they are for classical computers to solve.  So, any NP-complete problem would probably satisfy your criteria insofar as it would (likely) not gain any meaningful quantum speedup.

&gt; Also, will quantum computers make cryptocurrency obsolete?

Yes and no.  Quantum computers are capable of breaking the currently-used forms of asymmetric encryption, including the one used in all current cryptocurrency, so a quantum computer with tens of thousands of qubits could make all current cryptocurrencies fundamentally insecure.  However, research is being done on ""post-quantum cryptography"" which would give asymmetric signature techniques that could not be broken by a quantum computer.  A cryptocurrency that moved to those algorithms should be safe. 

&gt; ? Is it possible the government already has quantum computers but hasn't revealed them to keep the advantage?

Anything is possible, and we know the NSA is interested in such developments, but as far as I know there is little evidence to support that conclusion.

Depends on the device. TFETs? Far. To my knowledge no one's even made a research device that is sufficiently performant PLUS they are typically made of things that would require non-standard lithography, which industry generally won't even look at. Nano-wire FETs? Things are already going that way, I think a number of companies have said after FinFET they're going to GAA-FET (gate all around) which is already dangerously close to being just a ""nano-wire array"". Spintronics? Spintronics isn't aiming to take on MOSFETs but rather are aiming to leverage their ultra-low power capabilities and their ability to integrate logic and memory in a single device which means that they'll probably first appear in NEW applications, like Internet of Things stuff, rather than a conventional computing chip, competing with CMOS logic toe-to-toe. There are also neat things like Negative-Capacitance FETs which, part of their appeal, is they can slip in fairly effortlessly to existing CMOS fabrication, which means they'll likely be to market quite quickly IF they work.

In general, in the ""logic AND memory in one device"" camp, in addition to spintronics, you also have things like phase-change memory and ferroelectric-FETs. In these cases, even if the devices are close to industry fabrication levels, their utility is actually maximized by rethinking chip architecture completely. The idea of that probably has industry running at break-neck speed the other way, but it allows for things like native/device-level neuromorphic computing which has been shown to be dramatically better at a number of tasks like machine-learning and facial recognition than conventional computing paradigms.

&gt;haven't delved into the black magic of FET modeling at those nodes,

For industry it's about holding on to semi-classical models and literally stapling on several dozen mysterious corrective terms to things like compact models and just fitting the bajillion parameter Frankenstein ('s monster) to data. In research, quantum transport models are the norm.

&gt;The number of impurities (different than defects) in very small doped regions is something I've been meaning to do the math on.

Doping impurities must eventually become an issue, but I was more thinking of things like charge defects. In commercially available chips you have transistors where you can literally see single-defect charging and decharging in the IV characteristics and its effect can be substantial. The device-to-device variation in things like threshold voltage becomes enormous when the difference between zero, one or two defects (and where they sit physically in the oxide) in the entire device can completely dominate the transport.",1550751612,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",egy5vwe,,t3_asqmrl,,True,t1_egy4oik,/r/askscience/comments/asqmrl/why_is_nanotechnology_limited_only_from_1nm_to/egy5vwe/,1550751613.0,1,True,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For Iris recognition to obsolete fingerprints completely it would have to be an order of magnitude more reliable than fingerprint scanners.  The National Institute of Science and Technology gave [a pretty good analysis](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/07/wasserman_biometric_quality_workshop_iris_image_quality.pdf) of the tech.  It includes a discussion about the potential for permanent eye damage from the IR illumination that the technology requires, as well as a handful of other hurdles the tech needs to overcome before it has a shot at becoming ubiquitous.  

When a reading is taken, it's compared to a database, and whatever is statistically closest is considered a match.  There are so many factors of variance that no two readings (called IrisCodes) are ever 100% identical. And while no public record of iris-recognition bypass mechanisms yet exist, the adoption of the tech is arguably not widespread enough to warrant white-market solutions.  

The technology isn't widespread because the scanners require lenses optimized for near infrared, as well as a static environment to increase the accuracy of your scan.  The more variance that is introduced (like in a typical smart phone environment) the less reliable the data, and there are already conflicting^(1) reports^(2) about the reliability of iris scanning in general.  It seems that the technology is being used strictly for perimeter and border security at current. 

As you said in your post ""Multi-factor"" authentication is superior. Often an RFID photo ID card accompanies the security measures needed to pass an Iris checkpoint; or the fingerprint or facial scanner on your phone can be used to cross-verify your results. But you asked if it would be worthwhile for the average person?

We didn't think people could have cars, cellphones, or PC's once upon a time. If you can overcome the hurdles, though, why not?

Tl;dr *Debatable reliability in real world operations, Prohibitively expensive*

&gt;Here we test this possibility using a standard experimental false memory paradigm and inter-individual variation in verbal categorisation ability. Indeed it turns out that the error scores are significantly negatively correlated, with those individuals scoring fewer errors on the categorisation test being more susceptible to false memory intrusions in a free recall test. A similar trend, though not significant, was observed between individual categorisation ability and false memory susceptibility in a word recognition task. Our results therefore indicate that false memories, to some extent, might be a by-product of our ability to learn rules, categories and concepts.

&gt;Little is known about the reliability of eyewitness memory among adolescents as most memory research has focused primarily on adults and young children. A number of studies recently have emerged outlining conditions where memory suggestibility increases from early childhood to adulthood. These developmental reversals are found in semantic association tasks such as the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm and have not yet been thoroughly investigated among adolescents. In the current study, we examined DRM performance among 11–21 year olds (N = 245). Extending the work comparing children and adults, false memory on the DRM task increased with age. False memory on the DRM task was not associated with false memory on a memory conformity task. The different memory processes involved with the tasks and the implications for legal psychology are discussed. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20623420

&gt;False memories were significantly and negatively correlated with measures of intelligence (measured with Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), perception (Motor-Free Visual Perception Test, Change Blindness, and Tone Discrimination), memory (Wechsler Memory Scales and 2-back Working Memory tasks), and face judgement (Face Recognition and Facial Expression Recognition). These findings suggest that people with relatively low intelligence and poor perceptual abilities might be more susceptible to the misinformation effect.

Furthermore, the confabulation scores correlated very poorly with the other psychological variables.

778,,higgs8,,,[],,,,text,t2_cuxuz,,,"It's understood that there are two major kinds of memories in the brain: long-term and short-term, though these have many sub-types. It seems long and short term memories work quite differently from each other.

The forming of long-term memories involves the physical structure of neurons actually changing. Circuits of neurons (neural networks) are created, altered and strengthened through repetition. So it's very much like hard-wiring, as opposed to constantly active electrical activity like in computer RAM. It's like widening roads that see heavier traffic and building shortcuts where they are needed, making it possible to see this change from a satellite even when the traffic isn't there anymore.

When you do something mentally (a physical action or a mental one such as reciting a poem), it requires specific neural paths (and probably multiple paths, one triggering the other) to be activated and used. When you do it again, these paths are reinforced, strengthened and made more efficient, so the task becomes easier and faster. These changes eventually become quite stable and permanent, thus long-term.

Short-term memory works differently. It's more like working memory, in the sense that it's only available while you're actively using it and decays on its own within a minute, or as soon as more information overwrites it. Short-term memory can become long-term through conscious effort and attention. It's possible that all short-term memory becomes long-term automatically, and from there it can be strengthened further or forgotten.

Short-term memory is kept in ""neural loops"" in various parts of the brain. For example, they can be kept in visual form which you can ""see"" in your ""mind's eye"", or in phonological form, by repeating information which you can ""hear"" as your ""inner voice"". These memories don't form permanent neural paths, so they require constant active repetition to stay there. In that sense, they require electrical activity or they are instantly forgotten, which you could compare to computer RAM.

Recalling memories involves retracing the neural paths that have been formed by long-term memory. These paths are very complex and they often overlap each other in many ways, so one memory can trigger another, or the beginning of a path can trigger the full path. Once a neural path is retraced, the result of this is restored to short-term memory for access. Doing this strengthens the neural path by making it more efficient so the next recall will be faster, but in the process, some details can be lost. It's like walking a path multiple times, eventually the corners get cut in the name of efficiency.

To recall a memory, there needs to be a trigger or cue. Most memories are accessed through direct retrieval, which means that a question or cue will trigger the appropriate neural path. This is different to how a computer would search a database by going through every item in a list until it found the right one. A more efficient way to retrace a path is ""recognition"" (as opposed to recall) which acts on a shorter path and is more specific. For example, you recognize a face you know instantly and with 100% certainty, without having to go through a bunch of memories about that person to come to a conclusion. Facial recognition will bypass many brain areas to achieve a faster response with a confident binary outcome (it's either John or it isn't — there is no inbetween).

As for deleting memories (forgetting), ceasing of electrical activity won't delete your long-term memories. Cell death, however, will, which is why people who go without oxygen for too long will start losing some memories. Though a brain will always produce some electrical activity unless it's dead, that doesn't mean that the electrical activity is what maintains the memories. It's the neural paths that maintain them. Older memories may have more neural paths, so they can be redundant (you may have multiple independent memories of your childhood but only fewer memories of your recent job). Short term memories are wiped after a minute anyway, so at that point they're definitely gone.

That’s (one way) how new works and authors are discovered and spread. If I’m considering buying a book I’ve never heard of from an author I’m not familiar with, I’ll read a few reviews. They won’t be my 100% deciding factor, but they help me get a feel for if it’s a road I want to go down. Also if the author uses amazon, their number of reviews directly tie to how well the search algorithms work for them.

One anecdotal example is that I find myself using more full and complete sentences when I can speak then naturally, but I’ve also found myself using a simpler vocabulary because I can’t rely on the transcription algorithms.  It also makes inserting emoji’s and other gesture text a lot harder so I tend to omit those.

I also saw a lot of speech to text in the recent movie Where’d You Go Bernadette. It was nice to see some other person besides myself dictating fairly long emails using their voice while walking around the room.  For now Hollywood seems to use it as a kind of shorthand for antisocial type a personality. And it also works great for exposition.

A third said the word “faces” was replaced in his copy with “feces.” 

Except these three examples are no longer available for purchase because Amazon does attempt to police their store for quality issues.  It's just that the reviews stuck around even after the particular product they complained about was gone.  

The one that was worded slightly different - I remember hearing a couple of years ago that people were doing this to avoid automated copyright protection.  How it works is that you use a translation program to take a book from English to another language.  Then take the result and translate that back into English.  That results in a book that is very similar, low effort to produce, yet doesn't word-for-word match the original file so it's hard to detect by automated programs.  I remember there was a glut of these a few years ago, and Amazon cracked down on them and updated their algorithms to get them harder to produce.  This review stems from that era.  

&gt; A $5 Indian import was at No. 970, which suggested copies were selling at a steady clip.

But this is legal.  Kind of scummy, but totally legal.  [It even went all the way to the US Supreme Court.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtsaeng_v._John_Wiley_%26_Sons,_Inc.).  Do they want Amazon to prohibit books published in one nation being resold in another nation? 

That wouldn't impact just these books.  It would also mean that a fan of Harry Potter, for instance, wouldn't be able to order used UK editions because the UK copyright is held by a different publisher than the US copyright.


I agree, Amazon needs more QC'ing on the products they sell and they also need to figure out a solution that groups similar editions together, (eg. all books translated by the same person, or published by the same company, etc) instead of the half-assed system they have now that, I think, just does it haphazardly by title without regard for content.    It makes it really easy for a bad copy to slip in and be legitimized by the reviews for more professionally published editions.

Daunt got the publishers in the UK to drop the co-op system so Waterstones went from shipping back 25% of books to only 4%.

From a story point of view they are quite different really. Hyperion is more a collection of short stories ties together by a framing plot that in the end leads to an open cliffhanger (if I remember the ending correctly). I'd say Hyperion is high Sci-Fi, as it has quite arcane gadgets and the ideas (the tree ships, teleportation houses of that one bard and the like).


Dune is less flashy in its Sci-Fi and more a take on religion, human nature, the danger of destiny (prescience actually but destiny in a way is prescience).

I think you are far too optimistic about the current state and progression concerning general AI. While we finally have the computational resources to run learning algorithms we're barely scratching the surface on unsupervised learning which would enable a computer e.g. to learn how to identify a cat without telling it what a cat is. The basis of those algorithms have been disovered 60 years ago and while we learned how to apply them, very little progress has been made on the theoretical side. The step into general AI seems to be a multitude of what has been reached so far. I can go into further detail if you are interested but I will not be able to do so tonight (it's already midnight where I am).

&gt; Sure, a quasi religious dedication to asceticism, struggle, and  achievement may crop up, but I suspect it will be a small minority of  people that will take up the mantle.  Why?  Two reasons.  One, in this  coming day of hyper productive AI (which is likely going to excel human  capabilities in the creative and 'meaning' industries as well), what, of  ANY value, can these ascetics make that are not valued only because a  human made it.  Two, for the same reason most people scoff at and  dismiss religious peoples who say the only way to meaning and happiness  is OUR way to meaning, the future man, satiated by simple pleasures will  see these people as quaint oddities (Amish) at best and ideological  extremists (totalitarian communist) at worst. 

The big question is if we will ever be able to create a machine, able to create true art and not just an illusion of it. IMO art must consist of two components. Intention or agenda of the artist who chose to do something because of deeper reasons and reaction or an emotional response by the beholder. While these two things are not independent, they are not fully interdependent either. We might be able to train machines to create media that elicits an emotional reponse but without the initial spark, the selfish intention to create for the sake of creation the result will be nothing but shallow. To create AI that would be able to do an artists work, we would need to put self-interest above self-preservation into a machine. We would basically need to put a soul into a machine. Yet, we don't even fully understand what a soul is. 

To be clear, I am no proponent of asceticism. Maybe I did not express myself clear enough before (english is not my first language). I think we need to be learn to create meaning while being in a state of abundance.

&gt;The most interesting  thing about this book however, is that while Huxley intended it to be a  warning against such a society, he actually ends up making the best  argument FOR this society.  This argument is plainly stated in the words  of Mond in the very conversation that is quoted above, and I think I  agree with him.  Who has the right to say whose happiness is more or  less valid than anyone else's.  Do you... because you have suffered?   Why is that the measure?  Who decided so?  I think the book would have  been much better if Helmholtz took up Mond's offer to become a  controller.  Would have make him the hero in my eyes and a good contrast  to the self centered and 'woe is me' Marx.  Instead he decides to  selfishly go suckle his angst on some remote island thinking he is  better than everyone else for it. 

I have to disagree with you. Huxley describes a scenario in which the longing for meaning has been suppressed by breeding a new kind of human that is simply too short sighted to look further than the next fix. As soon as the inner voice starts to speak again it is drowned with soma or a pregnancy substitute. Those people however are merely wet machines lacking the sacred need of a human being to trancend above ones current state.

The longing for breaking in the  boundaries of ones current self can never be satiated by abundance, no  matter what. The only thing abundance will do is obfuscate your path to  achievement. 

I think the only reason that there is any 'longing' or 'need' for asceticism, struggle, or achievement in life is that there is still a deep seated value that one must earn what one has, both in the individual and in society (and it is currently being reinforced).  I believe society is capable of disabusing itself of this 'economy' and I think it might happen (and may have to happen) very soon.

If such a society can be technologically and socially achieved, I see asceticism, struggle and achievement being decoupled from meaning if for no other reason than the sanity of the masses (How can you find meaning in achievement if the AIs can achieve godlike thinks in comparison to you?).  I see far too many people already achieving this in our day (only feeling a prick of angst when someone judges/criticisms them openly) to imagine that many won't embrace it once the stigma of sloth goes away.  At best, I see a sizable segment of the population devoting themselves to thrill seeking and imagining that THIS must be struggle and thus meaning.

In a [recent essay](http://indiespecfic.blogspot.com/2019/06/betty-when-you-call-me-you-can-call-me.html) I discussed artificial intelligence, and how it is seen as a 'threat.' In defining what I meant by that term, AI, I used the example of an orchestra. To me, there is an overblown sense of danger when AI is invoked, ie 'Terminator', or HAL 9000. Both of these presume a malevolent sentience, born of unyielding logic.

However, the orchestra provides a decent model of an AI - there are instruments, experts who play them, and a conductor. 

WHAT they play, and what the Composer created, are two entirely different matters. And, to add another layer of complexity, the Audience can interpret this performance in a myriad of ways. This is comparable to the argument being made here, vis a vis 'author intent.'

Similarly, the reading of a story or book, or the watching of a film or show will depend on how well the ideas of the Creator are relayed. Communication is, after all, transmission, reception, understanding and comprehension in an iterative engagement. The factors that prevent a common understanding of these is the lack of reciprocity brought about by the media being used as the presentation.

To the OP's point, most interpretation is subjective. My feeling is that the fear of an AI becoming sentient is vastly exaggerated, as it is the aspect of free-form creation that differentiates Consciousness from mimicry.

This is not to say that AI or autonomous devices are not potentially dangerous, but that their mission charters are a variable defined by their programmers. This bias, the illusion of logic and utility, is not something AI can develop, imho.

This is what Big Data is really all about: 

1. Consumers buy stuff. This makes producers money.

2. In order to make lots of money, producers need to make stuff that consumers want to buy, but sometimes it's hard to **predict**. Instead of just making *good stuff* and hoping people will want to buy it, they invest a lot of time and money into figuring out what **type of person** is most likely to like their product, and convincing that group of people that not only will they enjoy the product, they *need it right now*. 

3. The process can go two ways. You can start with:

a. Design a product &gt;&gt;&gt; Find a target market who wants to buy it

But you could also

b. Identify a target market &gt;&gt;&gt; Design a product that they will want to buy

Big Data lets you combine those two things, because companies can collect such a ridiculous amount of information about how people interact with their products. When you have mountains of data, you can make it go in a circle:

Design product &gt;&gt;&gt; Identify Market &gt;&gt;&gt; Collect Data &gt;&gt;&gt; Design anew based on that data &gt;&gt;&gt; Market &gt;&gt;&gt; Data &gt;&gt;&gt; Product and on and on and on.

The more data you collect, and the more new products have tons of data collected on their use and reception, the more **predictably** you can target your market. If you can predictably target people who may want to buy your stuff, you won't waste money advertising to people who don't care. But on the other hand, if advertisers (i.e. Google) can promise you more **predictable** outcomes from your ad campaign, they can charge more money, because their service is more valuable. 

All of this is predicated on collecting data on consumers and creating finer and finer categories to stick them in, where our consumption habits become so predictable to producers as to become an exact science. They will maximize profits because they will never over-produce, they can spend as little advertising money as possible, and they know exactly who is most likely to buy what and how to reach them. They want us to be **predictable**, and the problem is that they start helping people out in constructing their very own identities based on the products they use. 

Google and Amazon's objective is to control your entire visual environment in order to make you as predictable and captive of a consumer as possible. (Customized advertisements based on your browsing history, Google Glass and other Augmented Reality coming soon, etc.) Then they want to make it as easy as possible to buy stuff impulsively. Mobile pay where you just tap your phone on a thing, for example, or those pilot grocery stores that just auto-charge your account when you walk out of the store with your chosen groceries, or Amazon's one-click ordering. 

For this reason, **Data is Capital for these folks. Data itself produces value for people who know how to take advantage of it.** 

When you browse online, you are **generating new capital** for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, Snapchat, etcetera. Like Zuckerberg says, ""If you're not paying for it, you are the product"". It's amazing that this statement doesn't really freak people out as much as it should, because this shit is like 1984 combined with Brave New World times two.

I get what you're complaining about but it's mostly.. not true.   It's a straw man stereotype.   The only actual YA series I can think of where the protagonist is ""SUPER SPECIAL""  is the Divergent series, where she's some kind of genetic information repository or something. 

In the Hunger Games, Katniss is *not* special.  That's made clear over and over, all the hype about her is acknowledged open in-book to be bullshit and propaganda.   All just cynical political theatre.   They don't even try to hide that fact from her.

The best example of this is Soma. Is he saying soma is a bad thing, or that we should all be doing it? Maybe answer that before the rest of the comment, because the way people see soma can tell a lot about how much they have misunderstood the book. Or the sex. Is the sex in the book supposed to be a good thing, or another sign of the meaningless reality of modern life?

The first 2 chapters were presented as a tour of a scientific facility that conveniently housed everything of scientific import under one roof. In my copy it's 27 pages, devoted entirely to seemingly unconnected futuristic images as we follow a tour from The Director around these weirdly presented and boring experiments that are supposed to be of critical import to something. The narration here is all over the place; at times present tense, implying that we are following the director as he walks around; other times it becomes a weird future tense, implying that these tours happen so often that we the reader are imagining not a real tour that is happening in this world, but a hypothetical tour that may or may not possibly happen at some time in this other world. On the second page there's these 2 examples:

&gt;""Just to give you a general idea,"" he would explain to them...  
&gt;  
&gt;""Tomorrow,"" he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality.

but then it changes to present tense again, as if we're following them again?

the first openly didactic part is:

&gt;“I shall begin at the beginning,” said the D.H.C. and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their notebooks: *Begin at the beginning*. “These,” he waved his hand, “are the incubators.” And opening an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test-tubes. “The week’s supply of ova. Kept,” he explained, “at blood heat; whereas the male gametes,” and here he opened another door, “they have to be kept at thirty- five instead of thirty-seven. Full blood heat sterilizes.” ***Rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs.***

I've highlighted that last part because I have no idea how that applies to the section in questions, and what moral questions or idea it is trying to convey. It's a strangely poetic shift from the clinical almost jaunty language, that feels as if Hixley himself is trying to insert a joke that's outside of the narration and world of the novel. How are we supposed to feel about these test-tubes? Is it good or bad? Why is it here in a novel? 

The entire next paragraph is painful language that informs us of the exact minute minute by minute work to preserve the eggs and stuff, and how this is all good for society. It's cold, dry, painful, boring exposition trying to sound smart, but painfully out of date and judgemental. The Bokanovskification process is the major instrument of social stability, and we're being shown it in the most boring clinical way with these characters who are nothing and nobody, and just parroting whatever ideas Huxley thought should be known to idiot uneducated readers.

&gt;But one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay.  
&gt;  
&gt;“My good boy!” The Director wheeled sharply round on him. “Can’t you see? Can’t you see?” He raised a hand; his expression was solemn.

It's not judging, critiquing, analyzing, or even having us make moral judgements. It's demanding our assumption of received knowledge from the Director and by extension Huxley. He wants you to think these certain things the way that he sees them, and he's assuming you will think them just because you have read his wise profound words. 

Chapter 3 keeps all the boring scientific stuff, but drops most of the tour to intersperse random excerpts from other scenes and events from the world, but these don't have any connection or importance, and often don't actually show or do anything. It's the literary equivalent of listening to people on the bus talking about eating beans, but with such little actual action or energy that we can't get any deeper meaning from the random parts.   
Here's an unedited excerpt as it appears in my book:

&gt;Crying: My baby, my mother, my only, only love groaning: My sin, my terrible God; screaming with pain,muttering with fever, bemoaning old age and poverty-how can they tend the wheels? And if they cannot tend the wheels.  
&gt;  
&gt;The corpses of a thousand thousand thousand men and women would be hard to bury or burn.  
&gt;  
&gt;“And after all,” Fanny’s tone was coaxing, “it’s not as though there were anything painful or disagreeable about having one or two men besides Henry. And seeing that you ought to be a little more promiscuous .”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Stability,” insisted the Controller, “stability. The primal and the ultimate need. Stability. Hence all this.”  
&gt;  
&gt;With a wave of his hand he indicated the gardens, the huge building of the Conditioning Centre, the naked children furtive in the undergrowth or running across the lawns.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lenina shook her head. “Somehow,” she mused, “I hadn’t been feeling very keen on promiscuity lately. There are times when one doesn’t. Haven’t you found that too, Fanny?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Fanny nodded her sympathy and understanding. “But one’s got to make the effort,” she said, sententiously, “one’s got to play the game. After all, every one belongs to every one else.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Yes, every one belongs to every one else,” Lenina repeated slowly and, sighing, was silent for a moment; then, taking Fanny’s hand, gave it a little squeeze. “You’re quite right, Fanny. As usual. I’ll make the effort.”

That's 3 different scenes interspersed with each other with no real indication of what is happening, why, or how it connects to anything else. The entire chapter is like that, and he keeps doing it. And the problem is that it doesn't eventually explain itself or present some key whereby we can realise how it is all connected other than appearing to happen in the same world. Any thematic or ideological connection between these different parts is disparate enough to be meaningless. It's a level of confusion that would make Burroughs annoyed.

Because there is no ideological statement or key idea in the novel. It's all just loose scientific jargon that Huxley assumed would educate us all in what we really should be like. People who assume to read into a a critique on science run amok, or the negativity of suppressing our emotions, or bullshit to do with genetic engineering, are floundering in the dark and applying meanings that Huxley almost certainly didn't have. He wasn't predicting anything, he was trying to tell us all along what lines we should be thinking if we wanted to preserve our culture.

https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-more-efficient-photosynthesis-20191003-story.html

It's short and worth a read because it offers an explanation as to why scientists were able to improve upon the main feature of an organism that's had 425 million years to refine it.  Basically when photosynthesis first evolved there wasn't any oxygen and it worked great.  Once plants began producing oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis they began grabbing oxygen and it gummed up the works, rendering their once highly efficient design flawed.

You'd think over the eons evolution would've found a fix but the way selective pressures work can preclude what would be the most elegant solutions from having the space to manifest.  This means a being able to understand the complexities of a plant is able to design a better plan than nature ever could... at least after whatever ""perfect"" models nature coughs up begin to choke on their own waste products.

Given that something as time tested as photosynthesis can be greatly improved upon with modern genetic engineering what reason is there to expect humans aren't full of all sorts of code that's become equally poorly adapted?

&gt;This isn't the same as Universal Basic Income because it's not  sufficient to replace employment. You could likewise cite the EITC -  it's not going to let you sit at home and do nothing, it will merely  make your life slightly more comfortable.

Mr. Yang has addressed this issue as well on a number of occasions. His Freedom Dividend is not meant to replace income or employment. It's designed to, in his words,""take the boot off of people's throats,"" and to give people a little more maneuverability in their options. That's why the 1000$ per month was chosen. This puts the annual dividend just below the poverty line.  Very few people are going to stop working on that amount. But it will allow them, however, to take extra classes,  explore other employment options, etc.  

&gt;Except you're not deciding on one hard piece of data and concluding that  you need to optimize your society around that hard piece of data.  You're combining a variety of factors to create a separate metric - and  that specific combination is subject to manipulation.

Mr. Yang will not be combining a variety of factors. He's joked that once he's president, he'll be the first president to give the State of the Union Address with a PowerPoint presentation. He calls it the American scorecard. He'll show on a screen many different metrics, and he'll talk about each one. He'll show the suicide rate, for example, and he'll comment on what was successful and what was not in bringing down that figure.  Then he'll do the same for each of this metrics, individually, in order to give us a much better, overall understanding of the well-being of our society. 

GDP and unemployment rates remain strong; meanwhile, our life expectancy has dropped for three years in a row. That hasn't happened in a hundred years. Suicide and drug overdoses are also at all time highs.  How often are these figures publicized, especially relative to GDP and unemployment?

The fact is that most people won’t - and the problem gets worse the longer you keep such a system going.

It's important to not take incentives in a vacuum, and instead compare them with what is already in place. There are many on current welfare programs that due to the requirements perpetually stay on those programs even though they want to work. Also, the amount of UBI matters a lot, and is the reason the amount chosen is below the poverty line. If it was above the poverty line that disincentive to work would be much stronger. It's also important to note that if we look at the last wave of automation of factory workers, a half of them have left the workforce and a quarter of them have gone on disability. Also a lot of these same people get caught up in the opiod epidemic and commit suicide. The main pain point is allowing those with a lower level of education to pivot into a new field and/or a new location. Current retraining programs have abysmal results and I don't think it's realistic for those individuals to enter into the new STEM jobs that are created, which still begs the question on how to best help them.

The same sort of thing was believed about welfare programs in general - until the long-term data started rolling in. The problem is that society adapts around such programs. As this occurs, the negative impacts - such as generational poverty - become prevalent.

Homelessness is another area where this sort of ""it worked in the trial"" thinking fails. It's actually pretty easy to feed and house people. But the inevitable consequence of this 'easy' solution is that your homeless problem *worsens* because homeless people start moving into your city to take advantage of those services.

&gt; A specific case would be Alaska, as Mr. Yang likes to cite. They receive a petroleum dividend of 1-2 thousand dollars annually for every man, woman, and child. There are 2.81 persons per household. So on average, every household will receive between 2810$ to 5620$ a year. At this amount, you would expect some dip in employment engagement that's commensurate to the dividend, but that's not the case:

This isn't the same as Universal Basic Income because it's not sufficient to replace employment. You could likewise cite the EITC - it's not going to let you sit at home and do nothing, it will merely make your life slightly more comfortable.

I think there *are* solutions of this sort that would work well - but most of them would outrage people. For example, imagine a program where we pay parents of young children 60% of the working parent's salary (capped at some level) if the non-working parent stays home.

&gt; Many if not most of the metrics that Andrew Yang is proposing does measure hard data: Suicide rates, opioid addiction, rates of incarceration, work mobility, etc. Other measures, such as contentment with work, is more abstract, but I would argue it is still a worthwhile metric to measure and study.

Except you're not deciding on one hard piece of data and concluding that you need to optimize your society around that hard piece of data. You're combining a variety of factors to create a separate metric - and that specific combination is subject to manipulation.

The virtue of using something like GDP isn't so much that it's ""better"" but that it's a long-standing, agreed upon metric. That limits your ability to custom-design a metric to suit your preferred policy goals.

Consider the health care debate. On the left, you have people stressing how horrible the U.S. health care system. On the right, you have people stressing how exceptional it is.

[You might want to check out the Finland study which opponents of UBI love citing as a failure.](http://fortune.com/2019/02/08/basic-income-finland-employment/)


Ironically, many of them cite the Finland study without actually reading it. 



The study said that the group that received the UBI were ""no better **or worse** than the control group at finding employment in the open labor market."" Which means it didn't make them lazier which is an attack that critics of UBI will use. 



The concept of UBI has been going on in Alaska for the past 37 years, where they receive a dividend from oil that's drilled there. They did a study on what you are claiming and found it [""didn't lead to fewer working Alaskans.""](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/13/16997188/alaska-basic-income-permanent-fund-oil-revenue-study)


Both studies also showed that populations that received a UBI we're healthier and less stressed about their well-being. 


There's a reason why Andrew is proposing a $12k a year Freedom Dividend. It's right at the poverty line. You honestly think people are going to quit their 40k jobs to relax and live off of $12k? I doubt it. Most people need to work to find purpose and meaning; a UBI gives them more flexibility to take chances. Lazy people are going to lazy no matter what. But let's not pretend that everyone will become couch potatoes and quit their jobs because they're getting a measily 12k raise. 





&gt;That’s a problem, because one of the main points of the experiment was to see if a social security system that used a basic income would give people more incentives to find work than the traditional system.


They we're trying to see if UBI **increases*"" employment. Andrew Yang is proposing the Freedom Dividend to do exactly what that study proved, help Americans breathe. It is meant to help American's get the economic boot off their throat as we transition to an automated economy. [Did you know around 80% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck?](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html) Andrew Yang wants to help Americans be healthier and less stressed about money. In addition to revitalizing the economy as Americans spend more or get that car/home repair they've been putting off.

&gt;Various localities and organizations already have experimented with  forms of UBI over the years.

[https://www.wired.com/story/the-paradox-of-universal-basic-income/](https://www.wired.com/story/the-paradox-of-universal-basic-income/)

&gt;The researchers found that the unconditional payments to residents had  no real impact upon full-time employment levels (whether positive or  negative), although they did find that part-time work increased by about  17%.

&gt;The flaw in this is actually what Yang believes is a virtue. When you  change metrics from the consensus of hard data values to more abstract  ones, you introduce significant bias into those metrics - and those  metrics end up serving those who create them, not those who are subject  to them.

Many if not most of the metrics that Andrew Yang is proposing does measure hard data: Suicide rates, opioid addiction, rates of incarceration, work mobility, etc. Other measures, such as contentment with work, is more abstract, but I would argue it is still a worthwhile metric to measure and study.

As for the hard data we do use to measure the well-being of the economy, such as GDP, can also be very misleading, even biased depending on who is interpreting the data:

905,,ViskerRatio,,,[],,,,text,t2_iugup,False,,"&gt; For every 100 jobs you displace with robots, you may create only 10 jobs servicing the robots, administering them, working on software, etc. The job market is undergoing a fundamental change, and the old market isn't coming back.

This isn’t really the case. You actually create more jobs than you supplant.

The real issue is twofold:

1. You can’t *fill* the new jobs. The level of labor specialization required to perform useful work designing a robot is significantly higher than the level of labor specialization required for the job it replaces. Unfortunately, despite a push for ‘STEM’, there just aren’t enough people with the kind of skills necessary - and it’s unlikely there will ever be since humans aren’t getting any smarter.

2. The rate of change. Most workers spend their 20s learning their job and then work that job for the rest of their life, with minor changes. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult to do. Instead, workers must hop onto a constant cycle of ‘career development’ that is difficult to maintain as you pass prime earning years - especially in comparison to the young people coming straight out of school with all the fresh knowledge (and much lower salary demands).

&gt; Men who are unemployed volunteer less often than employed men, participate less in their communities, and generally become more antisocial. They end up succumbing to alcohol and drugs, and many take their own life. The problem Yang says is that humans need work, but work doesn't need us.

This is both true and something many people just don’t want to think about because it slices across so many of their cherished notions about the world.

&gt; The first step is a proposal for universal basic income to handle at least the need provision of work and free up people to pursue more creative or entrepreneurial ventures that may be too risky in our society.

The difficulty with a ‘universal basic income’ is that it runs afoul of Part #2. If you simply pay people not to work, many of them just won’t work - and you accelerate the very problem you’re trying to solve. It’s nice to speculate about people pursuing their dreams. The fact is that most people won’t - and the problem gets worse the longer you keep such a system going.

&gt; You achieve what you measure, so Yang proposes indexing economic well being by other statistics that more closely reflect the wellbeing of the average person than something like GDP (e.g quality adjusted life expectancy, childhood success rates, etc).

The flaw in this is actually what Yang believes is a virtue. When you change metrics from the consensus of hard data values to more abstract ones, you introduce significant bias into those metrics - and those metrics end up serving those who create them, not those who are subject to them.

This notion of “let’s just change the metrics” is an example of a classic flaw in thinking about human society: the pretense that if someone just put *us* in charge, we’d fix everything. However, the fact of the matter is that anyone who does get put in charge inevitably just fixes the system to favor themselves - the only kind of people motivated enough to reach the level where they can make large-scale decisions tend to be narcissistic in the extreme.

Moreover, even if somehow a purely, saintly individual were to reach such a level, they wouldn’t be *smart* enough. No one is. The reality is that the world isn’t run by Presidents and Premieres - it’s run by markets. Only markets have the collective wisdom to manage the world and all we can do is establish the rules under which those markets solve our problems for us.",1554588031,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ek9wjn9,False,t3_ba95t1,,True,t3_ba95t1,/r/books/comments/ba95t1/the_war_on_normal_people/ek9wjn9/,1554588033.0,11,True,,False,books,t5_2qh4i,,,1554893518.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because weapons kill people and we want human discretion when people are being killed. It's not a question of the AI becoming sentient and turning against us.

&gt;Your probably right but the fact of the matter is we don't know that. I mean if you create enough artificial nural connections and perhaps if quantum computing (computing with many more variations than 1 and 0) ever turns out to be viable than robots could generate thought faster than us.

I can't speak much on quantum computing because I don't know much about it, but your description of 'neural connections' and 'thought generation' are pretty off in my opinion. Artificial neural networks are nowhere near thought generation, that's not even their purpose. They can be applied in ways that make it look like the neural net is 'thinking', but it just isn't the case. The current state of research is very far off of what you describe here.

My C.V would often just be disregarded. If I got to an interview I might have a chance, but a company will very rarely choose to interview someone with no education or working experience over a graduate. Especially in the current economic climate where many people are over qualified for their positions. 

If I did get a job in the field I would get paid less due to not having a degree. My current professor ended up in teaching because the guy who sat next to him in his old job was getting paid £6000 more despite them doing the same job. So he went to get his degree then ended up staying there to teach.

It's a huge problem I have to overcome as I have trouble studying or attending lectures since I just don't like the way the material is taught at all.

Today, AI is defined as ‘the study and design of intelligent agents’, which are systems able to perceive their environment and act based on what is happening. The subject of AI overlaps with computer science, data mining, facial recognition, robotics and others such as the study of the human mind.

A lot of people think intelligence is measured by a thing or a test, but actually human intelligence can be categorized into nine types, according to Multiple intelligences: New horizons in theory.

The nine types of intelligence are intrapersonal, spatial, naturalist, musical, logical-mathematical, existential, inter-personal, bodily-kinæsthetic, and linguistic. Of course, every-one has all these components to a greater or lesser degree. Some are strong musically while being weaker spatially, while others are strong in the existential area but are introverted and thus have less in the interpersonal area.

Yeah, that's right. One is degraded to a second rank citizen by virtue of automatisation and facial recognition technology.


The host of the documentary visited a fair on facial recognition hard- and software, and showed the viewer a screen on which everyone in the crowd is shown to be scanned *and analysed* realtime, with their personal data next to their head shots, as well as certain behavioural metrics. Passport data, visa status (""citizen"" or ""expat""), but also donut charts on probabilities of acting in certain ways.

You could probably store a good detail face image of everyone in the US in about 300 Terabytes. You can get a 10 TB HDD for about $350 off amazon. Storage is dirt cheap these days.

Even if your facial recognition isn't that effective, let's say it can narrow down a face to about 20,000 people from your dataset. You get an image from a camera where a guy robbed a bank. You narrow it down to 20k people out of your 222 million (number of those with driver licenses in the US). Then you cross reference the location with everyone that lives within 50 miles of the bank (really easy with elastic search). Now you maybe have 100 people, and you can cross reference it against people with criminal records. Now you probably have about 1 to 5 people a human can investigate.

Okay, you seem to be basing your positions on a lot of misunderstanding. Seeing as you appear to be unwilling to engage me as a peer, I'm going to have to start quoting sources at you to illustrate your base misunderstandings. You also appear to have completely inverted my statements in order to argue against them. For example:

&gt; is just wrong. We don't need to recreate a human being to understand how cognition works

I agree, I said the opposite in fact: we need to understand human cognition in order to replicate it.

I'll now try to illustrate to you how the frontiers of science are nowhere near this. Using your qoute as a basis:

&gt;We've done this using the same principals followed by models created by our understanding of how neuron interaction occurs.

This is actually a very inaccurate statement. While ANN were originally intended to try and replicate biological neuron function, based on some fundamental understanding of the connection between neural science and higher brain function, the technology as it stands has completely diverged from that intent

&gt;ANNs began as an attempt to exploit the architecture of the human brain to perform tasks that conventional algorithms had had little success. They soon reoriented towards improving empirical results, mostly abandoning attempts to remain true to their biological precursors.

From wikipedia. You can in fact trace this abandoning of the original intent to the fact that we have no understanding of how to formally connect higher brain functions and biological neuronal networks. This point is summed up nicely by the fact that we have been unable to make this connection for one of the simplest biological neural networks known:

&gt; Nevertheless, the hydra is the first step towards breaking the neural code – the way that neural activity determines behaviour, says Yuste. “Hydra have the simplest ‘brain’ in the history of the earth, so we might have a shot at understanding those first and then applying those lessons to more complicated brains,”

They literally have a complete map of the neural system, which comprises about 800 neurons, and still haven't been able to make that formal connection to higher brain function.

https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127625-entire-nervous-system-of-an-animal-recorded-for-the-first-time/

I haven’t studied this so I may be talking nonsense, but it seems to me that the biggest problem with Communism is that it assumes that everyone will work for the greater good whereas Capitalism assumes that everyone is basically greedy. Therefore I think that Communism has been relatively unsuccessful because the people in power were greedy and sought to maintain their own status and perks at the expense of everyone else. There weren’t as many checks against greed built into the system and so it was relatively easy for people in power to abuse the system.

How will a high-tech Communist state be different? Maybe by making Communism more democratic than it has been? If there was a system in place which made sure that the “will of the people” was adhered to and that corruption was punished, could it work? But how would tech achieve this? The first thing which comes to mind is some kind of perfect voting system so that elections couldn’t be tampered with, but even if you can ensure that everyone votes and that every vote is counted correctly you still need to have a way to make sure the voters are receiving full and impartial information beforehand otherwise the system is still open to manipulation.

Say for example a govt created a program with the stated intent that it compiles records of social media interactions for a person and tells you how likely they are to commit a violent crime in the near future. Does the computer do what it's told? Absolutely, it'll take whatever input data of social media information it's given and do whatever algorithms to reduce all that form down to one output in the form of a probability. The question comes up though of if what it's been told to do actually is determining the probability of someone committing a violent crime. Then you have to consider, as well as just outright errors, potential biases in the people who came up with algorithms to see that. Will they consider some types of behaviour more suspicious than others even if they in reality aren't more dangerous indicators? Could it end up taking things into account that aren't relevant at all, or not directly so? 

Machine learning might look like a solution to that problem but then you have the issue of biases in the training data. With the crime example you'll probably be using police reports, which effectively means you're interesting the biases of the police into your program. This becomes especially a problem if they use this program to inform their decisions, amplifying that same bias more. And then if the program is trained again later on this more biased data you can see how it would become self reinforcing.

To me, you have to approach the movie in a very different way compared to a more traditional narrative movie. The story, as it is, doesn't really get moving until well into the movie, and even then is generally downplayed within the movie itself. 

To me, the movie works best when it's viewed almost like a series of paintings or short abstract experiences. All the sequences lined up are connected more thematically than they are with any kind of story. When viewed this way, I find the movie absolutely stunning. It's about evolution, the explosion of technology, the horrific, unknowable scope of the universe, the loneliness of existence, the potential power of Artificial Intelligence, the question of what the future for humanity holds...

Watch it expecting a traditional story, though, and you will absolutely be annoyed at the 15 minute sequence of monkey people milling around, yelling at a weird column. You will want to take a nap when there are long, slow shots of spaceships docking. Yes, there IS a story in there, about some kind of powerful intelligence (presumably aliens, but I've read interpretations where it's god), poking humanity along through its history into new discoveries. But, in my worthless opinion, that almost serves just as a way to present its themes and ideas. 

I also think the lack of a protagonist for much of the film makes it difficult to watch for general audiences. I mean, how far into the movie do you get before you even meet Dave?

The two speak as one, each saying but a part of the message, and the final message is formed from the resonant frequencies of the two voices. 

-

An excerpt of this internal dialogue: 

&gt; Emphatic Blossom at Dawn, like all of the Turusch, was of three minds.

&gt; Literally. The Mind Above, as the Turusch thought of it, was the more primitive, the more atavistic, the original consciousness set that had arisen on the Turusch homeworld perhaps three million of their orbital periods in the past. The Mind Here was thought of as a cascade of higher-level consciousness from the Mind Above, more refined, sharper, faster, and more concerned with the song of intellect.

&gt; And the Mind Below was more recent still, an artifact of both Turusch and Sh’daar technology, a merging of Minds Here into a single, more-or-less unified instrumentality.

&gt; For Emphatic Blossom, the Mind Above, a shrill demand almost beyond reason, screamed, “Kill!” The Mind Here, analyzing the data coming through the artificial awareness of the Enforcer Radiant Severing, echoed the demand to kill, modifying it with sensory data and intelligence flowing through its linkages with the ship. “Kill,” yes, but with an awareness that the Turusch fleet was now caught between two separate and rapidly closing tentacles of enemy force, that the fleet was caught in a crossfire that seriously hampered its maneuverability and limited its tactical options. There was a distinct possibility of gaining an important advantage if the enemy carrier vessel could be crippled or destroyed.

&gt; But the Mind Below carried a different message entirely.

&gt; “There are strategic considerations that take precedence beyond the tactical,” Blossom’s Mind Below was saying. “The Sh’daar Seed requires that we withdraw.”

&gt; “Threat!” cried the Mind Above. “Kill!”

&gt; “The prime orders have not yet been fulfilled,” replied the Mind Here. “Enemy ground forces remain on the objective world, as do the nonmilitary components. These should be eliminated before we withdraw.”

&gt; “The ground forces will soon be withdrawn. This is the judgment of the Sh’daar Seed. The prime orders will be fulfilled.”

&gt; “Threat!” cried the Mind Above. “Kill!”

&gt; “But we can yet inflict severe damage on the enemy,” the Mind Here insisted. “Our sensors have identified no fewer than twelve major vessels in the alien fleet massing greater than twenty-eight thousand g’ri, including their fighter carrier. Destruction of those vessels would seriously weaken the enemy’s ability to mount a counter-offensive against Turusch fleet elements and bases within the sector.

&gt; “And the Sh’daar Seed, as ever, circulates plans within plans. When the enemy reaches the Bright One, all of the enemy ships shall be destroyed, and their homeworld left defenseless.”

&gt; “Threat!” cried the Mind Above. “Kill!”

&gt; The Turusch tactician considered the matter further, then agreed, Mind Below and Mind Here slipping into harmony.

No wait, hear me out. 

There are a lot of good novels and movies being mentioned in this thread, and many of them are favorites of mine. But most of them are variants of space opera. Some have FTL, some do not. Some have advanced AIs and augmented humans so strange they might as well be alien. Many are set in deep time, far enough into the future that the world is near unrecognizable. And they're all great. 

But The Martian is only a few decades out. It shows us a mission so believable I'm surprised when I find discrepancies between NASA's plan and the novel's plot. It is a future reality so perfectly imagined that it doesn't even seem like speculative fiction. That's \*rare\*. That's so rare. Even the dystonian cyberpunk novels of the eighties didn't capture the feel of a few decades away with anything resembling realism. They seemed more a projection of the authors' fears than anything.

It is also a story that takes a look at modern narrative conventions and heaves them out the airlock. Parts of it read like a nineteenth century epistolary novel. Other parts read like someone set The Office at NASA. Those shouldn't play together, but they do. Our main character is not a flawed protagonist trying to overcome his inner challenges and flaws. He's just a guy who wants to go home and isn't taking ""impossible"" for an answer. 

And if you like the book and go looking for something similar, you won't find it. If you liked Revelation Space, you can go read the Polity novels. If you liked Honor Harrington, the Lost Fleet has you covered. The closest I can come to it is maybe Moon or Ex Machina, and while both are phenomenal, they are completely different ideas, stories, structures and settings.

And because I can find nothing that will scratch my Martian itch, I would call it the most unique sci-fi novel of the 21st century so far.",1568572332,{},f0erfge,False,t3_d4j87o,False,True,t3_d4j87o,/r/scifi/comments/d4j87o/what_in_your_opinion_is_the_most_original_scifi/f0erfge/,1568572716.0,1,True,[],False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I will share the tome I found in either Nov/Dec of last year - there's only 2 books in the series so far, but they hit me so profoundly that I think of it to this day. The premise is something that could be real. Think of a world where an AI has taken control of the world - governments are powerless to stop it, and that's generally a good thing, because it has a general sense of benevolence about it. It also rewards people nicely.

It's both scary and awesome. The world it creates is one where the followers of the AI are micromanufacturers, drivers, pizza parlors, mechanics, engineers, scientists... and the AI has the power to put them to work on the problems that they were born to solve.

Members of the followers wear special glasses that overlay a virtual world on top of the real world - augmented reality. A person can be in a crowd but clearly see the 5 people that he/she needs to meet with, in order, to assemble a piece of equipment, 1 part at a time - receiving each piece from each person that he meets. Just-In-Time manufacturing and delivery.

And it's awesome how it all comes together.

What I found profound is that this world is possible, and the token of choice would be a crypto coin. I'd go with Eth over Btc because of the availability of DAPs and Smart Contracts, but that's neither here, nor there.

So, the books I'm talking about are Daemon and Freedom, by Daniel Suarez. I wish I could give them away freely to everyone I meet. If everyone was so inspired... my goodness. We'd have a world of plenty where all would be served, where all would be equal, and where all could find a just life and place within this world to thrive.

If you're interested in going down the rabbit's hole, PM me, and I'll share my GoodReads.com list with you. I'm into some weird stuff, like pandemics and epidemics, wwii and cold war history, and lots of sci-fi.

A man who plays old retro video games with a lost sibling, freaking out when his old game console fails. Or a father who drives his kid to school, because its the only memories he has stored because he always worked too late. Parents who force the other siblings to reenact party games or holidays with a lost sibling. Each one struggling with their grief to a point that augmented reality memories are adversely affecting their lives. Once you build a few of the characters back stories and supporting characters, weave the stories together and have an ending of sorts that gives maybe a measure of closure or at least bereavement from their suffering and loss. For bonus points I would include someone who could create black market false memories, or augmented memories as it were. I would include them somewhere in the story where the memories of a certain event become corrupted and they are the only ones to replace the lost data be recreating it, maybe even adding to it. The AR junkie getting his fix. You could even mix in a whole AR dark net subculture too, with people buying custom made celebrity memories or something darker. And there is a decent name, Augmented Memories. Short, sweet and to the point. 

Season two would start with finding out that someone can hack your augmented inputs and create false interactions making people believe its reality and not the augmented overlay. Literally talking to people who are not there, but instead talking to a specific, sophisticated AI built just for the target. But 100% real and appealing to the intended target, and can even bleed into the surrounding peoples AR given close proximity. Then build a plot around taking over the people in charge of the AR network and bringing it down from the inside, as every one in the world uses it. Each character profiled would be interacting with something using them as an insider man. Except for the last character, who is also an AI being trained or built by an AI but it doesn't know its an AI yet. And since the tech exists to create false reality, the network must be taken down before the Government or Evil Empire uses it to pacify the populace, could be the motivation behind taking the network down. Leave all that on a cliff hanger on who wins, the hackers or the Evil Empire. 

Season three, who knows? Maybe both, one story where the AR network is down, and one where the Evil Empire wins and who knows whats real anymore. Kind of a fractured or layered reality. Make it where you can not tell which one is the real world, by weaving story lines into all realities. Maybe for an ending, the people who thought they won, did not really win, but was given that reality to them by the Evil Empire to finally pacify them. Maybe an AI was playing everyone all along, doling out perceived realities like psychological treatments to patients.

Shit, call Netflix. I would totally watch this series, and I hear they green light everything... Anywho, I liked your video. And I will stop rambling now. Just remember me if Netflix calls.

Alternatively, depending on the job and the psychological research that comes about in the future, typical offices might be replaced by more natural settings.

First, I think you're cutting the timeline a bit short. The red giant phase goes on for several billion years. There is plenty of time to relocate. 

Secondly, the Goldilocks zone is simply an area where water is liquid. Humans don't *need* to live in it, we can build our own habitats. We've been doing this on Earth for millennia, living in places where we would die without our constructions. Space is helluva lot harder, of course, but in terms of hard sci-fi, very doable. 

So the humans don't have to live on moons and planets, they can build their own space habitats, which they can move further out as required. Big rocks like Ceres would provide a good hull to start with. 

The same goes for ark ships - they're absolutely unnecessary, as the next solar system is not going to offer more than what is already available here - a sun, and plenty of empty space and raw material.

Trying to control and direct that process in any logical fashion would likely be impossible. You’d probably have an easier time with genetic engineering but even then it’s not as simple as slapping some fish genes into a human embryo. 

All of which is to say nothing of the ethical backlash.

By A.M. GITTLITZ JULY 24, 2017

H. G. Wells’s foundational work of political science fiction, “The Time Machine,” predicted a future in which a small utopia of sprightly elites is kept running by a subclass that lives below the ground and is reduced to bestial violence. This prediction, carried to a horrifically logical extent, represented the intense wealth disparity of the Victorian England in which Wells wrote the novel. Judging from the major political narratives of the fictions of our era, films like “The Hunger Games,” “Elysium” and “Snowpiercer,” the certainty of a future rendered increasingly barbarous by class division remains essentially the same.

But this was not always the case. In 1920, Wells met Vladimir Lenin, a fellow world-building visionary who planned “the inauguration of an age of limitless experiment” to rebuild and industrialize his country from ruination by years of war, abolishing class society in the process. Wells was impressed by the pragmatic revolutionary and his planned “utopia of electricians.”

If Wells had been less skeptical of Communism and joined the party, he wouldn’t have been the first sci-fi or futurist thinker to do so. Alexander Bogdanov, an early political rival of Lenin’s, wrote “Red Star,” a utopian novel about a Communist colony on Mars where everything was held in common and life spans were greatly extended through the use of parabiosis, the mutual sharing of blood. Along with Anatoly Lunacharsky and Maxim Gorky, Bogdanov proposed a program of “God Building,” which would replace the rituals and myths of the Orthodox Church through creation of an atheistic religion.

For his part, Gorky was a fan of the Cosmism of Nikolai Fyodorov and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a scientific and mystical philosophy proposing space exploration and human immortality. When Lenin died four years after meeting with Wells, the futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky’s line “Lenin Lived, Lenin Lives, Lenin Will Live Forever!” became not only a state slogan, but also a scientific goal. These Biocosmist-Immortalists, as they were known, believed that socialist scientists, freed from the constraints of the capitalist profit motive, would discover how to abolish death and bring back their comrades. Lenin’s corpse remains preserved for the occasion.

Bogdanov died in the course of his blood-sharing experiments, and other futurist dreams were sidelined by the industrial and militarist priorities that led up to World War II. In the postwar period, however, scientists inspired by Cosmism launched Sputnik. The satellite’s faint blinking in the night sky signaled an era of immense human potential to escape all limitations natural and political, with the equal probability of destroying everything in a matter of hours.

Feeding on this tension, science fiction and futurism entered their “golden age” by the 1950s and ’60s, both predicting the bright future that would replace the Cold War. Technological advances would automate society; the necessity of work would fade away. Industrial wealth would be distributed as a universal basic income, and an age of leisure and vitality would follow. Humans would continue to voyage into space, creating off-Earth colonies and perhaps making new, extraterrestrial friends in the process. In a rare 1966 collaboration across the Iron Curtain, the astronomer Carl Sagan co-wrote “Intelligent Life in the Universe” with Iosif Shklovosky. This work of astrobiological optimism proposed that humans attempt to contact their galactic neighbors.

Interest in alien life was not just the domain of scientists and fiction writers. U.F.O. flaps worldwide captured pop cultural attention, and many believed that flying saucers were here to warn us, or even save us, from the danger of nuclear weapons. In the midst of the worldwide worker and student uprisings in 1968, the Argentine Trotskyist leader known as J. Posadas wrote an essay proposing solidarity between the working class and the alien visitors. He argued that their technological advancement indicated they would be socialists and could deliver us the technology to free Earth from the grip of Yankee imperialism and the bureaucratic workers’ states.

Such views were less fringe and more influential than you might think. Beginning in 1966, the plot of “Star Trek” closely followed Posadas’s propositions. After a nuclear third world war (which Posadas also believed would lead to socialist revolution), Vulcan aliens visit Earth, welcoming them into a galactic federation and delivering replicator technology that would abolish scarcity. Humans soon unify as a species, formally abolishing money and all hierarchies of race, gender and class.

“A lot has changed in the past 300 years,” Captain Picard explains to a cryogenically unfrozen businessman from the 20th century in an episode of a later “Star Trek” franchise, “The Next Generation.” “People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We’ve eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We’ve grown out of our infancy.”

For all its continued popularity, such optimism was unusual in the genre. The new wave of sci-fi in the late ’60s, typified by J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick in the United States and by the Strugatsky brothers and Stanislaw Lem in the East, presented narratives that undercut this theme of humans’ saving themselves through their own rationality.

The grand proposals of the ’60s futurists also faded away, as the Fordist period of postwar economic growth abruptly about-faced. Instead of automation and guaranteed income, workers got austerity and deregulation. The Marxist theorist Franco Berardi described this period as one in which an inherent optimism for the future, implied by socialism and progressivism, faded into the “no future” nihilism of neoliberalism and Thatcherite economics, which insisted that “there is no alternative.”

The fall of the Soviet Union cemented this “end of history,” in Francis Fukuyama’s phrase, and signaled a return to late-capitalist dystopian narratives of the future, like that of “The Time Machine.” Two of the most popular sci-fi films of the ’90s were “Terminator 2” and “The Matrix,” which both showcased a world in which capital had triumphed and its machinery would not liberate mankind, but govern it. The recent success of “The Road,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Walking Dead” similarly predict violent futures where only small underground resistance movements struggle to keep the dying flame of humanity alight.

Released the same year as “Star Trek: First Contact” — and grossing three times as much — “Independence Day” told a story directly opposed to Posadism, in which those who gather to greet the aliens and protest military engagement with them are the first to be incinerated by the extraterrestrials’ directed-energy weapons. (In Wells’s 1897 vision of alien invasion, “The War of the Worlds,” the white flag-waving welcoming party of humans is similarly dispatched.)

The grotesque work of 1970s white supremacist speculative fiction, “The Camp of the Saints” by Jean Raspail — recently referenced by the White House strategist Steve Bannon — has a similar story line. A fleet of refugee ships appears off the coast of France, asking for safe harbor, but it soon becomes apparent that the ship is a Trojan horse. Its admission triggers an invasion of Europe and the United States.

The recent rise of right-wing populism indicates a widening crack in the neoliberal consensus of ideological centrism. From this breach, past visions of the future are once again pouring out. Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg feel empowered to propose science fiction premises, like space colonization and post-scarcity economics, as solutions to actual social problems. Absent, however, are the mass social movements of the 20th century calling for the democratization of social wealth and politics. While rapid changes in the social order that are the dream of Silicon Valley’s disruptors are acquiring an aura of inevitability, a world absent of intense poverty and bigoted hostility feels unimaginable.

Shortly after World War II, Wells became so convinced of humanity’s doom, without a world revolution, that he revised the last chapter of “A Short History of the World” to include the extinction of mankind. Today we are left with a similar fatalism, allowing the eliminiationist suggestions of the far right to argue, in effect, for a walling-off of the world along lines of class, nationality and race, even if this might condemn millions to death.

If humanity in the 21st century is to be rescued from its tailspin descent into the abyss, we must recall the choice offered by the alien visitor from the 1951 sci-fi film classic “The Day the Earth Stood Still.”


“Join us and live in peace,” Klaatu said, “or pursue your present course and face obliteration.”

1099,,theothercoolfish,,,,,,,,t2_4cr7s,,,"Heh well, the reason why I think it's still worth discussing is because it allows us to look at the question of intervention, and other policies, within the frame of an entirely different perspective. You don't have to believe that aliens are visiting the planet in order to think about what that would mean, and what new light that could shine on our current day issues - eg social theory, economics, etc. 

While I agree that some humans wouldn't resent an advanced species showing up telling them what to do, there's a certain percentage that would never go along with it. Imagine for instance that the aliens show up and say ""gods? really? come on."" (Most of) the scientists will smirk, but the aliens would immediately have new religious enemies. Or worse - if they said actually, the only *true* gods Xorthax and Bnth. Or imagine that they say ""Look, you lot, you don't have jobs anymore because of this doohickey"". What would that do to the economy? What sort of distress would that cause? I think we have a tendency to look at first contact with aliens as either well, Alien, or this super optimistic view (eg Star Trek for lack of a better example). I think in reality it would cause a lot of issues for us, *unless* the aliens had done it quite a few times and knew exactly how to do it to minimize those issues.

Yes, some intervention appears to be good - there's always going to be ways of using a tool for good, just as there are ways to use that tool for evil. The problem is sometimes using the tool for good comes with a whole host of unexpected consequences. When you look at these questions on species/species interactions, rather than just one species doing things a myriad of different ways, I think there are new avenues for exploring the problems.

Take for example the absolute best case scenario. Aliens show up, and they solve all our problems. In fact, they give us access to the intergalactic internet, and tada - all the answers are there. Celebrations all around, right? No, I don't think so. Particularly, I believe that the scientific community would feel cheated. Never again would humanity have a great scientist who discovered something profoundly new about how the universe works. Humanity's scientific advances would end, and instead we'd merely be checking out books from the advanced species library. Future humans would be permanently robbed of those discoveries, and limited to being the students of the advanced species teachers. Sure, you could personally learn more than any other human that came before you - but that's always been true. Part of me also feels like in such a scenario, humanity would be the universe's biggest charity case. The (one) species that couldn't solve any of their own problems, and had to rely on a handout in order to make it. What would that do to our mindset? Would this not have profound changes on us? 

(That being said, I don't believe in ""pull yourselves up by your bootstraps"" within a culture, and believe that in this age of plenty, we're well past the need of implementing a universal basic income, but that's another discussion entirely).

Difficult to speculate, but I think it actually might be bigger than the brains capabilities. After all we are talking about vast molecular processes. In that case this technology might have difficulties to compete with other ones demanding less computing power.
&gt; Also you must take into consideration how important for neural system development are purely physical phenomena such as being touched, rocked, held etc. You probably also might simulate them partially virtually and partially physically but that adds to the overall complexity.

DNA code and brain process are two separate things: the first is huge and slow, the other his huge **and** fast (while both are somewhat code based)

The initial work of the supercomputer is aimed to deceive the DNA, the brain (which, of course ""don't yet exist"" at the beginning of the process) works by its own: brain is supposed to adapt by its own. It doesn't really need to be constantly deceived. It just need to pick path between ""this work"" and ""this DO NOT work"".. and then it program and re-program itself.

DNA code is huge, but relatively slow and not all data is actually used; still, probably not something that today supercomputer would be able to handle. It may be possible to bring quantum computing to the equation for better suspension of disbelief


&gt; The part I like the most, even though I'm not fully convinced by it, is how regulata are afraid to loose humans. There's a great potential for interesting stories and narratives.

To be more convincing I could stuff some pseudo-social reasoning on this; let me see...

Humans can produce humans without machine/factories; while is technically a certain number of regulata (they have inbound small 3d printers in their bodies, and they can ""join"" in great number to build a whole 3d printing factory) can theoretically still be able ""produce"" other regulata their problem is that they need quite long period of formation/study to prepare their brain for the task (which still would be almost impossible for a single individual). Compare it to the time a human need to get a ph.d: for them almost everything it's pure brain activity.

For regular human ""have child"" takes away much less cognitive brain power since the internal organs where previously coded by DNA for the process of giving birth from beginning to end.

A cataclysm that would both equally decimate regulata and humans would see the regulata more prone to extinction (while impossible to re-build new factories all hope rely on human ability to reproduce and keep going on)

Another, more simple, reason would be cultural: ""the charm of the past"". Human history and fiction was made with those with ""the old standard"". Actors, musicians, tales, pirates, princess in distress and knight in armours etc.etc. (or historical fight for justice/equality and such and such).

&gt; I don't get why would they be worse in randomness and finding patterns, these are just features of human brain.

This is more a filler for the narrative need to force ""somewhat"" human and regulata closer (otherwise both will simply live their own preferred ground, being separate)

The SciFi reason would mimic how computer often rely an ""external resource"" to produce ""good quality"" RNG (ie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator )

The idea is that human and regulata have ""different hardware"" (with human being mostly organic, blood pressure, temperature etc) to generate RNG. The one that produce regulata (having way less ""organic RNG) is too perfect and do not conform with the one humans have. The result is some weird ""cultural difference in maths"" which regulata try to bridge (also as chance to keep their humans closer) with the humans.

It's an intentional moot point that both kind adhere to (while it's clear there's no ""different math"")",1524490723,,dxttcv3,True,t3_8e4y9a,,True,t1_dxtiuzn,/r/scifi/comments/8e4y9a/crosspost_regulata_my_take_on_transhumanism/dxttcv3/,1526644566.0,2,True,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,,,,,1354705578.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,2.0,19325.0,,public,False,

I was born in 1990, so right at the cusp of technological integration and more commonplace home computing, as well as the backend of better effects in film and television and the great age of the beginning of modern sci fi media. My father wanted to originally be Jacques-Cousteau, so he studied Marine Biology, but realizing he couldn't make a living really, as was drilled in to his head by his surgeon father, he dropped Marine Biology to go in to surgery, eventually becoming an Interventional Neuroradiologist and head of his department (he realized he wanted to work with computers and cutting edge technology for the time, but still be a doctor; Radiology was just getting its footing when he was in med school, and being Interventional, he is still on-call to do surgical procedures on spine, brain, whatnot) but he's always had an avid affection for speculating about the stars, Astronomy and classifying sea creatures. 

But the reason he wanted to be a deep sea explorer, as he would tell me, was that he was very logical and practical, realistic. He told me when I was little that we couldn't really explore space very well yet, but the ocean was kind of like an alien world on our own planet. When I was old enough to begin understanding the vast breadth of the universe, its infinite expanse and implications of nearly fathomless degrees of life creation, of different planetoid makeups, of the wonderous chaos of anomalies in the deep cosmos, knowing there was an infinitely expanding void out there rife with events I could not even begin to explain, I remember crying because I was so excited. 

I became enthralled by aliens and other planets growing up, when he would show my brother and I Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate, TRON, Last Starfighter, etc. He got a DOS system as soon as he could, my brother and I absolutely loved Wing Commander. I would go outside and stare up at the sky and make up stories about finding aliens, imagining what their ships would look like, how their people would respond to our people. My brother and I would play games outside where we were sucked in to computers and had to battle our way out through evil Digimon, Team Rocket, the evil gem bad guys from Sailor Moon, Frieza, etc. (We pretty much played 90's kid Ready Player One growing up.) We started playing Battletech, 40k, watching Gundam, I mean the list just goes on and on. 

We fed off of each other and our unabashed love for man's affection for the stars (everyone thinks my brother and I are twins; we act super similar, look eerily similar, though I'm a girl, have the same mannerisms, even down to neuroses about cleanliness and isolation, but he's two years older than me. We joke we were built, not born.) It wasn't until I was a little older that I started getting in to old pulps, Lovecraft, Azimov, Dune, Stephenson, quantum theory, all of the foundations and I could go on and on, but it's really history. My brother and I are both in tech, we get giddy every time we put on VR rigs, we're tinkering with robots, writing science fiction stories, devouring the latest books, shows, constantly staying curious. My mom just kind of rolled her eyes about it and let it happen; when my dad, brother and I get together, she always jokes that it sounds like we're speaking a foreign language. :) Our imaginations and curiosity just caught like wildfires and never went out.

while you can argue that it's just a copy, not you, the same is true for your biological body. stuff gets swapped out out in there all the time. and on a quantum level, it's even worse. but you don't care about all that, because the underlying patterns, the macro level stuff, are all still more or less the same.

this is the reason why i'm not worried about which one is the real me. it would make me uncomfortable to get copied, i suppose, by digitizing in a non-destructive manner, because with two instances of me, it'll become confusing, and we'll have a philosophical argument amongst ourselves about which one is real. the actual answer will be none of them. the instance of me that existed before will be gone, forever, as is true right now, from moment to moment. it's just that without any forking, it all makes sense intuitively. 

this doesn't mean that the obvious interpretation is correct. we know that matter is in a constant state of flux, and that the universe, the more you zoom in, becomes less stable, less predictable, and less continuous. but we don't really care about the micro level, because we exist on the macro level, where all these things balance out. that's not the individual quark, atom, or  neuron level. it's the thought pattern level. and that's still the same, from moment to moment, and from substrate to substrate. i, personally, am fairly confident about that.",1505983182,,dnatwm1,False,t3_70sek9,,,t1_dnasjlr,,,1,,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,,,,,,True,False,,,,,,,,,

Welcome to the world of String/M-Theory and our nascent understanding of Dark Energy/Matter. String/M-Theory has been stated by many as a 21st Century problem using 20th Century Math. 

We don't know what will come out of these fields of study over the next century. It could take FTL from Nil to probably, possible or no problem. Or it might just nail the lid of the coffin on the idea for good. The march of time and discoveries lead to things that people never considered. Thomas Young never thought that his double slit experiments would a 100 years later be a leading factor in the development of a new branch of physics. 

As Physics stands today, FTL is impossible (Sorta there is a condition where it is technically possible but practically impossible). We have an idea what kind of discoveries we'll have in the coming couple decades. There will be some major advances in our understanding of gravity, quantum computing and optics, string/M-theory and I think plasma states. But 100 years from now? Who knows. So yeah I don't say impossible or never happen with Physics, on thing they drilled into us while getting my degree was keep an open mind but remember the well lit boundaries of previous discoveries but don't be afraid to push those boundaries that are still shadows.

[**Alien Encounters**](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4efkkw_alien-encounters-s01-e01-the-message_tv)

I have a preference for writers that deviate from the typical Sci-Fi narrative. I like stories that are believable or plausible. Some people would describe it as hard Sci-Fi, but I prefer to describe it as stories with logical consistency, or stories that don’t require a huge suspension of disbelief. I enjoy stories that are all about context, perception, and many different shades of grey instead of your typical clear cut, black and white battle between good and evil. I like Sci-Fi narratives that are mostly about a struggle to transcend the current human condition. I’m usually a fan of anything that promotes the idea of transhumanism, the technological singularity, or radical social change. 

My favorite television show at the moment is definitely Westworld, but I also listed the mini series / science documentary Alien Encounters as a close second even though it’s not your typical fictional story. I mentioned it because of the believable depictions of alien life and futuristic technology (quantum computing, nanotechnology, virtual reality, neural interfaces, hive minds, genetic engineering, synthetic biology) in the show. I think most of the ideas from Alien Encounters should be used in the majority of new movies or television shows about the future, people traveling in deep space, or stories about people with superhuman abilities (Marvel, DC, etc.).  

Other shows that I enjoyed –  12 Monkeys, Utopia, Person of Interest (hated season 5), Travelers, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, The X-Files

1127,,josephgordonreddit,,,,,,,,t2_605gf,,,"Let's jump ahead maybe 40 years from now, just for a fun thought experiment.

At the rate technology is advancing, we aren't far from higher-end jobs being the only jobs- intimate work with computer and engineering. Even [doctors might feel the crunch](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/self-taught-artificial-intelligence-beats-doctors-predicting-heart-attacks), though I'd rather the bedside manner of a person than something I know that (probably) doesn't have feelings.

We can assume that our computing (also assuming we didn't destroy ourselves) has reached either true AI, i.e. the actual thinking and building machine independent from human input, or is at least at near-apex, i.e. the greatest predictive algorithms with the greatest quantum computers.

We can also assume that our robotics have kept pace with AI developments, so we go from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-bgLsvw848), to something more natural and theoretical, i.e. the synths from Humans. 

So, with those two components in place, let's consider prosthetics. 

First, for 'integration', certain types of prosthetics might be necessary for future jobs. This isn't necessarily just picking up something heavy and moving it, but rather using advanced computer systems. [Elon Musk](http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-neuralink-connect-brains-computer-neural-lace-2017-3) has already started investing in this. When computers get too smart/fast for us, it might be necessary to link directly with them so as to share work via higher functions. More on this later.

Second, physically, humans have a beauty peak, but we live far past it. Many people would enjoy the easy way out of developing strength or getting in shape- and if there's artificial skin involved, there's then no worry of looking your age. In Deus Ex, having visible augments is also a sort of 'status symbol', especially when you look at the law enforcement augments vs. the triad augments. 

Third, functionality. This ties into the previous point- it's far more difficult to break a bone if it's made of titanium (unless you don't have that damn falling augment, then you're made of balsa wood). You can lift triple or quadruple the normal human limit without effort, you can run for as long as you like- faults are nearly nonexistent.

For a more personal example, I have a lower back injury that flares up on occasion when I do certain activities. I'd pay damn good money to get an artificial augmentation if it meant my spine and the surrounding muscles were stronger than ever.

Finally, I'll finish up on Integration. Think about how much technology has pervaded into your life, whether it's through apps or your phone or your Amazon assistant (if you have one). Then, consider the current array of new technology available that you may not have: smart watches, while having a slow start, have picked up in sales; self-driving cars are promising and are already being unveiled in some cities by Uber and other services; smart appliances, from your toaster to your blender to your TV, are becoming common. 

These things creep into our lives and become normal just by their presence and acceptance. Augmentation, if it's perceived to give humans either an advantage or confer a notion of efficiency or just be a plain old time-saver, can do the same. What's an arm if you get a better one that will hardly, if ever, age?",1492383680,,dgcpwrk,,t3_65pq7w,,,t1_dgcodeg,,1494125933.0,12,,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,,,,,1318092065.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,6.0,2124.0,,,,

With her new internship, Min enters the scene of a major breakthrough in quantum computing: the virtual world of Spheria, home to sentient inhabitants. As these Polyans explore their habitat, the research team has a unique opportunity to observe their society’s development. Anthropology and artificial intelligence will never be the same.

But Min soon uncovers evidence of a sinister secret. As overseers of a new species, some on the team can’t resist the temptation to play God. Others are tempted by the vast computing power behind Spheria and want to turn its quantum engine towards their own ends. If Min knows too much, what seems like the opportunity of a lifetime might just end it prematurely. Like the Polyans, though, she might find the lure of new knowledge too strong to resist.

This techno-thriller explores the lines of good and evil on many layers of reality, through science and mythology, between discipline and betrayal, from the human mind to the Polyan core.

The Eschaton is (as you note) a time-recursive entity, shoving the results of some arbitrarily complex computing process back through time to apply the solution or solution-space into the original computation. This makes a mockery of most of the complexity zoo (not all of it, there are still some interesting dark corners; dig into some of the discussion on crypto that will likely resist quantum computers for some direction).

This is were the Eschaton is at odds with writing a good narrative. The multiverse is a big, sprawling meta-space. Future potential timelines are a higher order of infinite in number. But what subset of that allow for the Eschaton to exist? And of that subset, how many result in the Eschaton (which probably turns to unity, since collapsing the wave function means different things once that entity exists)?

It's the Fermi Paradox blown up in scale quite a bit, with the Eschaton playing to make sure it isn't nulled out by some Filter event.

Now you're getting a situation where the Eschaton is practically sitting and rolling dice, or flipping a coin, and must bias Really Big Decisions into the probability space it will exist in. Big Stakes.

Mostly, the Eschaton doesn't give a rat's ass what individuals do (so you've still got free will), until some threshold (like on the edge of committing, in your instance of the multiverse, aka the universe, a causality violation). It's not clear if Charlie thinks the Eschaton needs to bias toward a multiverse subset in which it will exist (further complicating the virgin birth element of the thing), or bias away from negative events (meaning the Eschaton is inevitable, except when it isn't).

For Charlie as a writer, it starts to segment his potential plots. Trivial things where we can revel in the free will of his characters. Multiverse-threatening events where the stakes are massive (Vinge does this in _A Fire Upon the Deep_ where, spoiler alert, it's going to suck to be human in a universe defined by the Blight, to the point where the Powers Beyond the Powers feel it's a good trade-off to consign big chunks of the universe to the Slow Zone just to stop it).

It's the scale of the thing that is (I suspect, and he can agree this is among them, or spank me for presumption) tough on a writer. How many variations on that theme can you come up with and keep fresh? Just look at any number of movie sequels and you get an idea: more of the same, but different! Suuuuuure.

As a writer with some integrity, Charlie would rather come up with interesting shit, even if it's in a new untested-by-the-market universe, rather than hitting you with a replay (probably contrary to the advice he received from agents, publishers, etc.: ""this series moves copies, so keep 'em coming!"").

There's no middle ground for the Eschaton, and there's apparently no pleasing middle ground for Charlie.",1463960129,,d3fq2lk,,t3_4kkr52,,,t3_4kkr52,,1466030714.0,5,,,False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,,,,,,1339465111.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,5551.0,,,,

The story's mixed with a cold case: The murder of the creator of Hong Kong's most powerful AI, which runs the entirety of a billionaire V.R. industry, including the nurturing of berserk-proof androids. The AI is a mind clone (and former lover) of the scientist, and was stripped of her Habeas Corpus rights by the CEO. Illegally, of course. Every time she finds out, he resets her to a previous memory backup, keeping everything under control.

Later, a shadow broker finds out about the cryptocurrency transactions, so his henchmen kidnap the CEO's daughter and bioetch her body, making her look like an android. Her brain implants are also hacked to make her obedient and servile.

Now her father must hire a team of Rogue Hunters to recover the missing androids to be able to see his daughter alive again.

&gt; What specific SF stories/books have been helpful?

I don't know, sir. I'm not an encyclopedia. I tried to illustrate the argument that I think *Asimov* is making here, that the helpful thing is the mindset that sci-fi fosters and not specific works.

&gt;On the one hand he mskes that claim, on the other he says the details don't matter.

Yeah, I noticed that. 

&gt; What does that even mean?

It's a figure of speech that goes along with the rest of that sentence.

&gt; The application solution doesn't lie in science or engineering, but the humanities.

Right! I agree with that. Isn't science fiction a sub-set of literature, part of the humanities? Can't literature help us reckon with ourselves and our world, meditate upon those things, maybe ""to confront, to see fully, the possibility and danger of human error and, perhaps, the alternative possibility of human good""? If other literature can do that (it can), why can’t stories about different realities enabled by science/tech do that? I don't see why ""realistic fiction"" has worth but ""speculative fiction"" does not. Sci-fi isn't always ""techno-centric fantastic thinking""; the kind Asimov is advocating here is serious thinking about the changes technology has brought and will bring to us, seeing those changes in our societies through fictional scenarios which help us make sense of them. It's fiction ""used as a means of exploring the implications of ideas and technological developments.""

1173,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,"Today is August 13th, 2014. While drunk out of my wits due to a workplace environment which I get accused of sucking dick since I have a messenger bag and drink tea in the morning I hear  an electric zap behind me in the living room accompanied by a blue flash. I turn and catch a whiff of ozone.

On the floor with a stereotypical science fiction steam I see a belt melting its way into the top layer of linoleum.

The belt has a note pinned to the leather portion that states ""Use with care.""

The buckle has a date setting and what do you know, a U.S. postal address setting, how fucking fortunate for the plot of this tale. In my drunken state I instantly assume ""It's a time travel belt!"" I strap it on, forgetting that I'm hammered and not wearing pants.

The plan rapidly forms in my head. Unfortunately I enact the plan before any preparations can take place and as the glowing wires of time, space and other awesome stuff envelope me I scream ""FUCK!""

Dec 31, 2009.

I flash into existence in a crowded living room. Memories come flooding back in a weird not-quite-right deja vu. No man without pants appeared in my living room on new years eve the first year I lived on my own with a bunch of church friends I was busy introducing to hard liquor. Worse my foot was stuck inside the fucking coffee table. I had displaced the matter wholesale in my first non-parent owned living arrangement and had appeared staring my past self of five years ago down. Thank god I had lost all that weight, I had the upper hand in this scenario.

I looked at myself, recognition flashing in both of our eyes and two quick stomps I had busted the Ikea piece of shit table into smithereens. It should be noted that matter caught in the time bubble gets fucked, we researched it for a cumulative 8,000 years of trips back in time like this and the only way to describe it is actually ""fucked.""

I grabbed the 5 years past iteration of myself. I will be known henceforth as PM Prime. I'll figure out a way to explain the other iterations somehow but holy shit this rum is good. Fuck spiced rum, white rum is like drinking happiness while building up equal amounts of misery tomorrow when you wake up and your girlfriend starts yelling at you for bringing a jar of pickles to bed and eating them. Brine lingers.

I dragged him into my old housemate's shitty study and utter the phrase that in all reality I've held a secret since childhood in case I meet me from the future and I want to be sure it's not a clone or robot. Not even my girlfriend under threat of toothy bj has pulled that information from the core of my being.

PM 1 stares blankly and asks ""What do we do?"" I tell him ""We'll explain that I discovered time travel, after all everyone is drunk or high and I did appear in the middle of the room.""

Oddly enough this went over without a hitch and no one mentioned it ever again. How convenient. They also never talked to PM 1 again so that might not be so convenient. The point is there are now two of me. One is enrolled in college thus I use his ID to take a job that's below me (no official documentation here) and work my dick off.

The plan comes together when the documentation and software for a Bitcoin miner comes out. We use our school refund plus my almost minimum wage earnings to pay the rent a year in advance and begin mining. With two people working under one ID it's almost a breeze. I have a full education as PM Prime and jump from position to position, building up increasing levels of mining hardware.

Eventually we rent a whole apartment by 2011 to fill with mining gear. Our volume still too low to be a huge difference though the news about the crypto is already varying from the original scenario. It's not as high but only by about a quarter off of the original timeline.

I encourage PM 1 to reduce his drinking and focus, apply his acceptable but not impressive intelligence and advise him on the professors to take. We don't fucking cheat because we're already cheating enough as it is. If this plan is going to work we need to maintain a strict moral compass. 

By 2013 we have 45,000 BTC. Our analysis over the past four years suggests we sell out now. We do so slowly to avoid tampering with the market more than we already have. Shortly after selling the crash occurs and it's moderately worse than the original timeline. We pay taxes like a good citizen, after all, me as PM Prime wants to life as a free man.

That's still $9,000,000 each. Current gold prices as of 2013 still made that too much to carry back. PM 1 was only able to carry back 200 pounds since we were pretty sure he'd fall clear through the floor at the shitty old apartment if he went back with more.

I relaxed, paid off his debt, lived on his identity and died after taking care of my entire family and making shrewd investments that made moderately positive but not super influential changes to the world.

PM 1 arrived Jan 1st 2009 to find a still shocked iteration of himself from four years previous. With no memory of a second future self arriving it became apparent to the now three of us that this was the shape of things to come. Each day for a week new iterations arrived. Each carrying significant amounts of money and new ideas.

A single computer whose model was altered slightly and increasingly more powerful began to arrive.

After two weeks we halted future importing and decided to focus on what we had. We were building wealth but no value.

Thus is the plight of the marketer. 

Using our now hundred million dollars in untraceable funds we set up an organization that doled out phony identities and allowed each of us to obtain different degrees. At the end of a four year period we would elect one to go back and carry that knowledge with them. Effectively adding a new knowledge set to our ranks every day.

We spread out to different institutions, sensing an era beyond the four years to be one of facial recognition and advanced biometrics we altered as much as we could until we were no longer recognizable to each other.

What mattered most was the data we traversed with. While we could pass student notes back four years every time that proved of little good since to do so meant we learned nothing each time. 

What mattered was forcing a schedule of aging and education. Sending members back to complete their fields and return successful. By the third month we had a few members bordering on middle age with advanced degrees who analyzed their contributions from the previous day/four years and made changes to their plans.

Data management was the worst part. How the fuck do you track the same 30 people advancing 4 years, going back 3.99 and starting over? We had to age our 4 information technology PhDs to develop the software required to do so.

The day finally came when we had learned enough to begin addressing major society altering problems. 

We had all the money we wanted. Each member was made to bring as much gold back as possible (with only exception who was hunted and burned alive for putting the plan in danger) our wealth was unlimited. Every day between 4 and 9 million was brought back depending on the strength of the iteration returned.

After a year of days we had about eighty of us at various stages of development. Cancer and AIDS were on our todo list. We did our best to research it ourselves but we entered school with marketing ambitions and shifted to data mangement so the best we could do was to grab the best literature at the end of the four years and slip it to the right people come the beginning of the four years.

We finally designed a program that took 3 cycles to complete which harvested all the data on that final day of the four years so when we went back we could bring whatever that new day had brought with it.

Research and development across all industries seemed to skyrocket. If it weren't for our now uncounted millions of dollars thanks to investments and foreknowledge there was no way to trace where this information was coming from.

As every trip back created a new universe we created feedback loops of information that took a four year step back but provided an extra day's worth of literature to be studied and dispersed amongst humanity's guardians, the real researchers.

If it feels like our mission evolved from the original plans it sure as hell did. By the end of 2010 we were ferrying information backwards in time and guiding its development to make sure we could improve as much as possible next time we went back.

We tried a governmental takeover. Entrenched interest sensed their position failing and acted swiftly, nearly finding the facility with the belt. It was a disaster and all was nearly lost that cycle.

We shifted to a quieter mode of operation, longer term goals with moderate levels of manipulation and action. We never forgot that foul up and swore to find a solution. Had they captured the current traveler and the belt it would be all over.

We were so determined and sure of ourselves we forgot our greatest weakness. Lose control of the belt and we potentially lose it all. 

We decided we must rid ourselves of the belt issue so we sent three members back until they passed away of old age, With their passing came leaps and bounds of knowledge that their peers could not understand. We needed to know more. It wasn't until August 2014 when our reach into the past had caught up with the day the belt itself appeared that the answer became clear. 

He never explained how he found it and sending the belt sideways through the multitude of universes to the moment when PM Prime found it took his whole arm and most of his sanity. That iteration not only ended the time loops but began them as well. 

It is a paradoxical story that left hundreds of us wealthy and educated with a borderline religious commitment to carrying forward the knowledge we had guided for hundreds of years our time but only half a decade your time.

As of right now, in my fictional Season we're starting to address some of the structural problems of a backbone story-arc, and we're starting to correct how diluted Skye is as a character, but there's still work to be done.

Skye, Fitz, and Simmons still behave far too young for their character expectations. The Hub helps with Fitz, but doesn't take it far enough...yet. We need to put these characters through a battery of adversity to really see them mature, and not the kind of adversity where they're saved at the last second. You need a multi-episode arc to re-shape their motivations and behaviors.

I'm also assuming some of the more childish problems from Season 1 will be addressed in Season 1, specifically Skye not having her wrist-bracelet ban anymore.

So let's see what we can do to grow these characters up a bit.

Episode 3 (Part I):

BAM! SLAM! WAM! A hospital bed is being rushed through the Hub. Simmons is bloody and burned, near death on the table. Lab coats and doctors are rushing her into a secure medical chamber, and stabilizing her on life support. She's awake, but in shock. No clue what's going on.

She starts to wake up to discover she's security strapped to the bed, the doctors ignore her struggles. Inside the medical chamber military guards in clean suits hold her down while doctors strap tubes and a respirator to her. Super intense, super graphic. They jam tubes down her throat and up her nose. She's panicking, no one is saying anything. They slide her into a liquid chamber and seal the lid. She's floating with all these wires and IV lines sticking out of her, and she can't get out or get enough momentum to push against the glass.

Expand the view of the scene, through the tube, and through an observation window outside the medical chamber we can see the rest of the team looking at her inside. They all walk away.

FLASHBACK! We're earlier in time now, Colson is updating everyone on the new mission: A local priest had his mutant powers to chamelionize, and blend into surroundings manifest during a sermon,  and went rabid. The problem is he seems to be a carrier for a virus that makes anyone that come in proximity of him die of horrible ebola like symptoms, and thanks to his status in the community it's generating enough panic to seriously destabilize the local political climate.


Wherever that horrible and grungy place in the world you want Mogadishu, Rio De Janeiro, Benghazi...someplace awful whatever, the helicarrier is on an airfield near that city...and most of the team is in the warrens of this Americanized hell hole searching for that rogue mutant. Thanks to the nearby US military presence the team has to run without radio communication during their dragnet....

On the Hellicarrier Simmons is in the lab working from blood samples extracted from victims to create an antigen. The rest of the team is divided up in the field searching for the Priest. Helluva chase where they keep getting close, but he keeps escaping...But Colson and crew know they're close thanks to the trail of dying bodies they follow, and some TV magic mutant seeking goggles or radar or whatever.

Back on the carrier Simmons is alone waiting for some test results. Noises. The kind that let you know *someone* is on board. That's right it's our favorite new villain played by the wonderful [Brad Dourif]. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Dourif) He's on the Helicarrier, and he's creepy. 

Simmons panics and runs through the Helicarrier trying to hide from the evil mad genius. Our villain doesn't mind. He goes straight to the lab, hacks the intercoms and begins talking at her while destroying her work in the lab. Turns out, he doesn't care about her. But he activated the priest...it's an experiment of his, and he's not ready for Shield to end the ""clinical trial"". But finding Simmons aboard is a pleasant treat.

Once he destroys her research, he comes after her. She's totally frozen, and hidden in a floor panel in an utter panic. It's a bad moment for her. He looks down and says something suuuuuper creepy about always liking the schoolgirl types...anything to put her down for being so young and bubbly. Then he grabs her and kidnaps her!

Let's get back to the team now! It seems they've cornered the rabid mutant priest on the roof of a building, or someplace just as precarious...the trail of death he left behind is generating a street riot around them. Colson and Ward are locking the Priest down with no where for the man to go...and they're trying to talk him down, calm him, and bring him in. In a moment of clarity the Priest shakes off his rabid psychosis, and reflects on his new mutant ability and perceives his being a disease carrier as one and the same as his ability to chamelionize. Turning to Colson and Ward the priest says it's a sin to kill himself, but the damage he wrought is a greater sin. Colson makes a move forward to risk himself to save the priest. Ward holds him back as the mutant priest throws himself off the building to splat on the street. Skye, May, and Fitz are on the street level ahead of the street protest. They see the body on the sidewalk and call in heavy re-enforcements to secure the block...fully aware that a bigger medical/security presence will agitate the population further. Colson is pissed they're attracting so much public attention.

They return to the Helicarrier. Simmons is gone, and the lab is destroyed, the security footage reveals everything they need to know. Classic moment of Evil Brad Dourif staring right into the camera, like it's all going according to plan! Fitz freaks out because he's secrets in loves with hers (Simmons that is). Colson and May go to hatch their next plan. Colson is super pissed this mission is going so bad, and Simmons is gone on his watch. Ward steps in to calm Fitz down and set him straight. Reminds the man there's no value in getting angry, and Simmons needs him calm and collected and ready to roll. Fitz agrees.

Syke is left to herself in a weird limbo with no one talking to her, asking for her help or checking on her feelings. So she goes to a computer terminal and starts doing what she does best, which is to work alone with data....analyzing voice records of the villain, facial recognition patterns...any and everything to find more information.

Colson and May are arguing over what to do in Colson's office. Colson can't make sound judgements. He wants to stay and find her in and around the city insisting Simmons can't be far away. May keeps reminding him the city and country are on the brink of a revolution thanks to how unstable the city is. They need to leave. Diplomats have demanded they get out...the works.

We jump over to our evil lab with Simmons put under on a medical table. The villain is looking over her with a bloody scalpel. Dude is totally operating on her in some kind of nasty way. WHAT THE HELLL!!!!

Cut back to Ward cleaning a gun at the weapons locker. Fitz comes in. Admits he's never been good with guns. Hence his tack in science...but he's ready to learn. Does a whole Train me moment.

Skye is pouring over the TV style 'cybertrail' of the villain. She thinks she has a lead on his whereabouts. He's in France. WHAAA?

Netflix has the market share because they entered the market first. They have grown in a market without direct competition, often through licensing content they eventually lose as IP holders launch their own services. In the process, they failed to recognize who their real competition was. 

If you go back to the first few years, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has often said that their competition was cable and satellite subscriptions. Then he spent years talking about the need to [become HBO before HBO became Netflix](https://www.gq.com/story/netflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development). But today, it turns out that the strongest competition comes from streaming services that have the ability to _leverage_ their strengths into the field:

- Amazon is a behemoth of a company. They _host_ Netflix. They sell everything. They advertise themselves all over their website, one of the busiest in the world. They bundle free shipping and music and ebooks and all other kinds of crap with their video service. Prime Video could break entirely even, and Amazon wouldn't care because they don't need it. Amazon also grosses almost 15 times as much revenue as Netflix does. In a war of attrition, Amazon doesn't lose. 
- Apple and Google are similarly positioned to Amazon. In both cases, video streaming services also support their software/hardware ecosystems, meaning they may be willing to have streaming services that break even as long as they result in more revenue elsewhere. This is a simple example of cross-promotion, a form of business that Netflix is not currently positioned to do themselves.
- CBS sits on one of the largest IP catalogs on the planet. They date back almost a century, and have consistently generated content each and every year since. They also sit on market research and ratings analysis, which has existed in broadcast television's modern form since the late 1960s. CBS is merging with Viacom, which means CBS's catalog (which includes Showtime, the Smithsonian Channel, the CW, sports/news/international channels, as well as Simon &amp; Schuster publishing) will be combined with Viacom's (Nickelodeon, BET, CMT/MTV/VH1, Comedy Central, TVLand, Paramount Pictures, multiple news/sports/international channels, Bellator MMA/kickboxing, books and comic publishers).
- NBC would get a mention, except they belong to NBC Unviersal. Actually, that belongs to Comcast. Comcast owns NBC Universal, Telemundo, USA, SyFy, MSNBC, Universal theme parks, Sky Networks, Bravo, E!, Oxygen, Dreamworks, Fandango, Illumination, and through all of these dozens if not hundreds of foreign and domestic news/sports/entertainment networks.
- Aside from Amazon, all the rest of these pale in comparison to the streaming service(s) Disney offers. Not only Disney content, but Fox, ESPN, Disney music, publishing, and thousands of networks, stations, and properties. Disney is going to be a juggernaut, because they have consistently done one thing better than any other company on the planet - merchandising. Every division within the Disney company exists to support or be supported by merchandising. 

Assume for a moment that there is a good financially-driven motive for all of these companies to act the same way: to be going through huge mergers as they setup to kickoff their streaming services for real, to own amusement parks despite them having so little to do directly with mass media, or to collect media publishing capabilities. 

How does Netflix stack up? Well, the answer is that they offer [very little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix#Subsidiaries). They are exactly what they appear to be on the surface: a digital streaming company that makes some of their own content and licenses the rest. Their library is tiny, with only two shows longer than three seasons long. That will certainly change, but the lack of a competitive catalogue is one of the reasons they've taken on close to $25 billion in debt to produce content over the last several years. 

What Netflix has focused on the last few years is market expansion. They are available in pretty much every country with reliable internet. Which has worked to this point by ignoring competition and finding emerging markets where no competition exists... yet. But now, Netflix is going to reach global saturation, and their business model will need to shift from growing subscriptions into maintaining subscribers while getting as much profit as possible from each one. 


&gt;I went to a lecture at nextAI and they presented a map of the earth with countries colored red where they were the #1 streaming service. It was the entire earth minus North Korea and China.

&gt;The lecture was about their patented algorithms, and how incredibly powerful they are. They have the power to predict, generate, and verify that they are creating content which is fully adaptive and prevents churn.

I believe that's nothing but hype in the case of Netflix. While a ratings system like the Nielsen works by comparing competing broadcast events against one another, Netflix's AI is only able to look at how viewers use their own platform. It can't tell them if their viewers would prefer to see Disney movies or sports or news, because Netflix doesn't have any of those things to offer. AI has no way to determine whether or not Netflix is _competitive_ against other services. 

At the same time, Netflix's use of internal analysis has led to some questionable results. For example, they've found that more people will watch the first season of a new show than will watch a season 3 or season 4 of an existing show. People like new and shiny, which is great, but the end result is that anyone who's had Netflix for more than a few months can give you a list of canceled shows that pisses them off. If the highest ratings in TV history belong to the Superbowl, Netflix's AI has them producing nothing but Superbowls - but that's not really the TV we want to watch. 

All of these other streaming services are going to be run by companies that have a long history of being able to identify market and demographic trends, and then using it to develop popular and profitable content. It's driven by experience and internal policy shaped by the entire market, and no AI looking at a single platform is going to be competitive. 

&gt;In what respect? In my mind they are an institution, and people are jumping to copy them.

Streaming is being copied, because it's the future. Netflix has had a decade-long headstart, but they haven't found a way to secure themselves at the top. They are Myspace, Xerox, Kodak - a company with an edge that doesn't understand how to keep it. They have nothing unique to offer, other than getting there first. 

&gt;Actors are absolutely flocking to Netflix.

I would predict this is temporary, because it goes back to what I said above about knowing and developing content for the market. My example will be one George Lucas:

When George Lucas was first rolling into Star Wars, he was young, poor, and unproven. As a result, he didn't get special treatment, people told him no, the studios surrounded him with talent, and a tight budget resulted in one of the greatest film trilogies ever made. When George became obscenely successful, and leveraged it into merchandising, he peaked. He got special treatment, surrounded by yes men, and budgets as deep as his pockets - and he made the prequels. 

This is what Netflix is offering right now to try and steal talent. Tons of money and creative control to anyone who wants to jump to Netflix. But there will be two end results:

- Filmmakers without oversight aren't as good as their experience would suggest. Adam Sandler is a good example of this on Netflix.
- Filmmakers rarely want to make art that is easily digestible for mainstream viewing. Without executives demanding profitability and ratings, no artist ever makes a show as stupid as Big Bang Theory. But Netflix is in the film _business_, and shows like BBT are the ones that pay the bills. 

When Netflix gets in trouble now (like say if the stock market slumps), they only have two options: lower costs by making cheaper, more profitable shows (a direction they are entirely unprepared to move in), or raise prices. Raising prices will never be a good solution, because it means Netflix has no other way to make their platform profitable and signals that their collapse is inevitable.

Netflix should have secured a financial partner and bought FOX. They could have blocked Disney, while also shoring up all of the weaknesses with their organizational skillset and catalog. Instead, I'm willing to bet Netflix folds in the next five years, and is bought out by a company like Microsoft.",1568244469,{},ezxmy82,False,t3_d1z0yi,False,True,t1_ezw6omm,/r/movies/comments/d1z0yi/netflix_amazon_movies_banned_from_toronto_film/ezxmy82/,1568244470.0,1,True,[],False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Are you trying to suggest that this isn't how silicon valley works? :) Silicon valley is also a gated industry. Perhaps in the beginning yes, the internet was an open opportunity for anyone with an idea. It's not like that anymore. Venture capital controls everything.  But we shouldn't kid ourselves that silicon valley and the tech industry will be the saviours of cinema. 

Remember in the early days of the Internet we dreamed of how the Net was going to democratize access to things like News and we would no longer be under the shackles of large news and media organisations. The internet held such promise, it was going to tear down walls and destroy corporate power. Hurray! 

Except that's not what happened. 

Today we just have different corporate overlords. And algorithms are deciding what news and content we consume, who we interact with, who gets visibility and who doesn't. Data and algorithms are used to decide everything. Corporations like Facebook now are in positions where information can be manipulated to the point where they can influence election outcomes. Yeah, I don't think we should be cheering for the tech industry to be taking over independent cinema. This bullshit about how the internet can transform traditional industries for the positive betterment of society is a message from 15-20 years ago. Today we know better. 

Personally, I could care less if silicon valley wants to take over the role of big Hollywood studios. Those guys were a mafia anyway. But this debate isn't about Hollywood. It's about independent filmmaking and ensuring that filmmakers have not just have access to funding to get their films made but they also have an outlet to show their work. Film festivals and independent cinema are one of the last bastions of free expression and one of the few avenues through which storytelling can challenge/expose/resist the narratives of the powerful. Western society is at a critical crossroad, where so much of the information and content we consume is being used to control and manipulate us. The last thing we need is the tech industry taking over independent cinema. 

So we shouldn't kid ourselves that this battle in film festivals is a battle between Hollywood and silicon valley. It's not. The big studios were never really that invested in independent cinema anyway and they have already squeezed it out of the big corporate cinema chains. No, this is a battle for film festivals and independent cinema being able to remain as an outlet for independent voices, where funding isnt decided based on an algorithm.",1568099654,{},ezsntqd,False,t3_d1z0yi,False,True,t1_ezrmxzz,/r/movies/comments/d1z0yi/netflix_amazon_movies_banned_from_toronto_film/ezsntqd/,1568099654.0,1,True,[],False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we're comparing the movie to 2001, as the OP does, we can acknowledge that one of that movie's biggest strengths is that it lets you figure things out on your own. It shows you its characters in situations, speaking as they normally would, without wide sections of dialogue that are clearly set up to bring the viewer up to speed or tell the viewer what a character is feeling in so many words.

When Dave is deactivating HAL he's not narrating the situation, waxing poetically about the creation of artificial intelligence, and the wider meanings of destroying a consciousness and man's evolutionary step up to creating tools that think. These are things that the viewer brings to the movie themselves, or doesn't.

My main gripe with Interstellar is that I can imagine a version of it without all the talking-down-to-the-audience exposition, and it's glorious. If you'd never been told that the gravity around a black hole slows time down, and you just saw the characters go about their business, talking normally as if the time dilation thing was just understood between them, you'd figure it out on your own and it would be a really great film moment when you did. It would make you want to go back and re-watch it to pick up all the details that you missed the first time before the concept clicked for you.

&gt; The literal most famous and well known scientific test for artificial intelligence is the Turing test

The Turing test is an outdated theory which most of the scientific community agrees is a misguided way of assessing sentience.

&gt; The logical way to assess intelligence is to de-couple from your biased and pre-conceived notions and actually test it to the extent that you can

Who said anything about intelligence? An android may be highly intelligent, that doesn't mean it's sentient.

&gt; the reasoning that leads me to think other humans are sentient would also lead me to think that android is.

But your reasoning is not the scientific reasoning. You are just judging a book by its cover. That's what the average person may do in their everyday like, but that's not the reason science assumes human beings to be conscious. The strongest evidence we have is the biological similarity of our brains.

&gt; I imagine I'd save the one that meant the most to me personally.

Then let's say they are identical clones that you've just met. The only difference you are aware of is that one is a biological human, and the other is an android.

&gt; there's literally a Star Trek episode about it where a dude tries to argue that Data isn't sentient.

1222,[],DogmaticNuance,,,[],,,,text,t2_2ivpf57k,False,,"&gt; We assume they are unconscious because of our assumptions about how the brain works. It's not because of how they are behaving. A sleeping person doesn't appear conscious either. Yet we commonly assume that sleeping people are relatively conscious, because we've experienced awareness while we were asleep ourselves (while dreaming for example).

It's absolutely because of how they're behaving. If a sleeping person is incapable of doing anything *except* sleeping, that's what a coma *is*. If someone never displays any behavior except sleeping, you would not assume they're conscious and sentient. 

&gt; The way you're going about it is just totally misguided, and dangerous in its implications. You're judging a book by its cover, instead of using scientific reasoning to assess the likelihood of sentience. It's the common mistake we are all warned not to make when it comes to artificial intelligence, yet you are still making it.

No, I'm literally applying the tests that we have for sentience and intelligence. The literal most famous and well known scientific test for artificial intelligence is the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) which is explicitly a test in which the tester isn't aware of the biological nature of the consciousness being tested and has to make their decision based entirely on communication. 

&gt; By thinking logically. What is so hard about it? You know that you are sentient, so the rational assumption you should be making is that individuals who have a brain similar to your own are more likely to be sentient than androids who don't have the same brain at all.

That's not thinking logically, that's simply making assumptions and allowing them to influence your conclusions and it's the antithesis of the scientific method. The logical way to assess intelligence is to de-couple from your biased and pre-conceived notions and actually *test* it to the extent that you can, which means testing behavior and not whether it's flesh and blood or looks like you. 

&gt; The reason that is leading you to think other humans are sentient (similar underlying processes happening in their brain) doesn't apply to the androids (unless they literally have a human brain, which is the case in some sci-fi stories).

If an android was capable of behaving in a manner that appeared as sentient as a human in all ways, then the reasoning that leads me to think other humans are sentient would also lead me to think that android is. 

&gt; No, I mean if you had no proof about their sentience.

Well since no android has ever been able to mimic human behavior to the point that it appears sentient I'd have no reason to assume a random one would be, so of course I'd save the human. That's just playing the odds. We don't have AI that behaves in a conscious and sentient fashion yet and I never said we did, but once we *do*, that changes things. In a hypothetical world in which sentient androids were as common as sentient human beings, I imagine I'd save the one that meant the most to me personally.

This film is also Spielberg's most cerebral and philosophical movie thanks to Stanley Kubrick's (and his collaborators') treatment. Without spoiling much, this movie is about an android that is the first of its kind with the capability to love. It explores themes similar to films like *Blade Runner* and *Ex Machina*. This film brilliantly balances the optimism of Spielberg (which was actually Kubrick's contribution) and the bleakness of Kubrick (which was actually Spielberg's contribution). It's as if Kubrick and Spielberg teamed up to make a Pixar film. In terms of performances, Haley Joel Osment gave one of the best child actor's performances ever in a film. I also enjoyed the cameos by Robin Williams and Chris Rock in the movie. This film had amazing visuals that reminded me of *Minority Report* and *Ready Player One*.

Because you have a subjective experience that you believe will cease when you die. If you don't believe in even your own consciousness, then you basically don't believe in anything and morality stops being a thing.

I didn't ask why you thought you were conscious, I asked what proof you had. An artificial intelligence could say all those same things. 

&gt; Well no, that's my whole point. Our shared biological roots are why we believe we are the same internally. More specifically in regards to our brains, since that's where we believe consciousness arises. You are basically ignoring everything I explained in my previous post.

You have no idea what goes on inside someone else's head. The only proof you have that they're thinking similar to you is in the behavior they exhibit. Like I said before, you don't assume a brain dead person is conscious and sentient merely because of ""shared biological roots"". The behavior they display is the only proof of their sentience you have. And, again, aliens wouldn't necessarily share much biological similarity at all with us. 

&gt; But we can assess the likelihood. Since other human beings are biologically the same as you, it makes sense to believe they are more likely to be sentient than a creature who is similar in external appearance but doesn't possess the same neural network, only a software designed to mimic human behavior.

How can you assess the likelihood of a thing when you can't even *define* that thing precisely? You can't. A piece of software that passes every test for sentience isn't ""mimicking human behavior"", it's providing the same level of proof of it's sentience that any human being is capable of. You could just as easily say that humans only mimic each other.

&gt; The narrative as to why the dinosaurs are being auctioned off for such tiny amounts as the Indorapter sells for only about twenty-five million dollars, is because genetics research can be extremely expensive, as any university scientist or graduate student that's even remotely connected to the genetics department can tell you. The winning twenty-five million dollar bid would barely cover the very first phase of research costs involved in the creation of any dinosaur, let alone a novel hybrid like the Indominus Rex or Indoraptor. In real-life, you'd be looking at a winning bid in the high hundreds of millions, at the very least, because Eli was looking to make a quick buck from the sale. Many of those looking to turn the dinosaurs into living weapons would likely have hundreds of millions in the bank as it is, and are basically buying low, to sell high. Keep in mind, that as long as Dr. Henry Wu is around, they can make more dinosaurs under the nose of the public to sell later, and potentially make them to order. They're basically not selling an endangered species, they're selling the first batch. Same reason the park was falling off visitors (although it felt more telling than showing), dinosaur genes are old news. People probably can do some themselves, but Dr. Henry Wu or John Hammond had the Jurassic Park genes patented, so you have to buy that stuff illegally or take a cheap knock-off by a rival genetic engineering team. Alright, but does this really mean that these rare creatures are worth way less than football stars? Because that still sounds dopey. Plus, isn't Eli super loaded, anyways? What does he need that money for so desperately? That California mansion was worth more than the dinosaurs combined, I bet.

1258,[],FattyCorpuscle,,,[],,,,text,t2_4a5k9,False,,"I remember watching BotP when I was a tiny wee lad and I loved it at the time, but I felt let down when I found out how much was changed from Gatchaman:

&gt;The Battle of the Planets adaptation differs significantly from Gatchaman.[8] The difference is due to heavy editing made to make the show appealing to the audience in the United States by removing controversial elements (i.e. graphic violence, profanity, nudity and transgender characters) while adding elements reminiscent of the feature film Star Wars, which was popular at the time. In fact the name ""Battle of the Planets"" was an attempt to associate itself with that popularity of Star Wars. While the original Gatchaman was earthbound, dark-toned, and environmentally themed, the adaptation morphed it into a child-friendly outer space show with robot characters, although some environmental themes were kept, and this is also why the other planets to which G-Force traveled on missions looked very much like Earth. Setting, violence, objectionable language, and most character fatalities were altered or eliminated by cutting scenes, dubbing, and explanatory voiceovers (for instance, claiming that the city had been evacuated before a battle scene that would show the incidental destruction of buildings and houses, as well as explaining away the destruction of the Earth armies and air forces as being robot tanks and fighter planes).[9][10]

&gt;One of the most notable changes in the BotP adaptation involves the character Keyop (Jinpei in Gatchaman), who picked up a bizarre verbal tic of stuttering, chirping, and burbling every time he started to speak. There was a longstanding fan rumor that this was done because the original character spoke using much profanity and that Keyop's excess mouth motion would cover up deleting the words. This was not true, as demonstrated by the existence of an unedited Gatchaman version released by ADV Films in the US, in which Keyop rarely if ever used profanity. The in-story explanation for Keyop's unique manner of speech is that he is an artificial life form with a speech impediment because of slightly defective genetic engineering.[11]

&gt;The main villain, known as Zoltar in BotP, had an unusual background due to the hermaphroditic nature of the original Berg Katse character. In an episode where Katse's female half was featured (BotP title: ""The Galaxy Girls""), she was introduced as a separate character, Zoltar's sister, for BotP. (A hint of her actual nature was retained in the name she used when masquerading as a human, Mala Latroz—""Latroz"" is an anagram of ""Zoltar."")[11]

&gt;To compensate for the other differences, a robot named 7-Zark-7 — who watched over G-Force from their base, Center Neptune — performed explanatory voiceovers and light comic relief, which not only padded the time lost from editing but also filled in the gaps in the storyline. This device bears the influence of contemporary Star Wars film, with 7-Zark-7 having a visual appearance not dissimilar from R2-D2, and a somewhat camp personality in the style of C-3PO. Notionally, 7-Zark-7 ran the undersea monitoring station Center Neptune, from where he received information regarding incoming threats to Earth and relayed that information to G-Force. Zark and other added characters, such as 1-Rover-1, Zark's robotic dog (who could hover from one side of the control room to the other by spinning his tail like a propeller, Muttley-style) and Susan (the early-warning computer whose sultry feminine voice often sent Zark into ecstasy) added to the cartoon's youth appeal. Some additional footage was also animated showing G-Force members Mark and Princess (using their Gatchaman model sheets) interacting with Zark, as well putting an image of Mark on a video screen in the control room, helping his addition blend more smoothly into the existing Gatchaman footage (although there is a clear difference in quality between the Zark and the Gatchaman animation).",1563565364,{},eu8v1pt,False,t3_cfbj4s,False,True,t3_cfbj4s,/r/movies/comments/cfbj4s/russo_brothers_to_produce_and_possibly_direct_a/eu8v1pt/,1563565364.0,13,True,,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,1563651763.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

InGen capitalized on it privately through the entertainment industry, and now that InGen and Masrani are gone, the technology is going open source, where it will be capitalized on by black market criminals seeking to sell it to the military industry.  A black market operation developed a working prototype of a complex animal which is able to receive instructions through signals of light and sound, in three short years.  That isn't as stupid as you're making it out to be -- it actually makes a ton of sense.  In the movie, the Indoraptor was an experimental prototype who was sold by a greedy auctioneer without the permission of the scientist who engineered it or the benefactor who funded it's creation.

Your opinion that watching the movie is ""akin to torture"" is certainly a valid subjective opinion, but I urge you to give it a second chance without imposing the logic of that misunderstanding upon it.  From a Film Theory perspective, it is *absolutely*, beyond the shadow of a doubt, *objectively* a more competent film than JPIII.  Your opinion on the artistry and your experience of it is subjective, but the craft of filmmaking was just objectively better in this movie.  You didn't list any reasons it failed as a movie, you just questioned the logic of one detail in the film.  It succeeds in so many ways with a coherent narrative, clear characterization, *incredible* usage of the special effects (better in leaps and bounds than either JPIII or JW), successfully executes the tone of a horror movie and the tone of an adventure movie, has captivating set pieces, builds on the themes established in the original source material... it is by far one of the strongest sequels in the series.  I'm not trying to prove you wrong, I just hope I've convinced you to at least approach it from a different perspective and give it a second chance.  :)",1558225100,{},eo2nkie,False,t3_boxjvx,False,True,t3_boxjvx,/r/movies/comments/boxjvx/opinion_jurassic_park_iii_is_superior_to_jurassic/eo2nkie/,1558225104.0,1,True,,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,0.0,,1558800309.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rose       : Jack, listen carefully like a good boy!

Colonel    : The mapping of the human genome was completed early this century.
             As a result, the evolutionary log of the human race lay open to 
             us.

Rose       : We started with genetic engineering, and in the end, we succeeded
             in digitizing life itself.

Colonel    : But there are things not covered by genetic information.

Raiden     : What do you mean?

Colonel    : Human memories, ideas. Culture. History.

Rose       : Genes don't contain any record of human history.

Colonel    : Is it something that should not be passed on? Should that
             information be left at the mercy of nature?

Rose       : We've always kept records of our lives. Through words, pictures,
             symbols... from tablets to books...

Colonel    : But not all the information was inherited by later generations. A
             small percentage of the whole was selected and processed, then
             passed on. Not unlike genes, really.

Rose       : That's what history is, Jack.

Colonel    : But in the current, digitized world, trivial information is
             accumulating every second, preserved in all its triteness. Never
             fading, always accessible.

Rose       : Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander...

Colonel    : All this junk data  preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at
             an alarming rate.

Rose       : It will only slow down social progress, reduce the rate of
             evolution.

Colonel    : Raiden, you seem to think that our plan is one of censorship.

Raiden     : Are you telling me it's not!?

Rose       : You're being silly! What we propose to do is not to control
             content, but to create context.

Raiden     : Create context?

Colonel    : The digital society furthers human flaws and selectively rewards
             the development of convenient half-truths. Just look at the
             strange juxtapositions of morality around you.

Rose       : Billions spent on new weapons in order to humanely murder other
             humans.

             their victims.

Colonel    : ""You're special."" ""Believe in yourself and you will succeed.""

Colonel    : You exercise your right to ""freedom"" and this is the result. All
             rhetoric to avoid conflict and protect each other from hurt. The
             untested truths spun by different interests continue to churn and
             accumulate in the sandbox of political correctness and value
             systems.

Rose       : Everyone withdraws into their own small gated community, afraid
             of a larger forum. They stay inside their little ponds, leaking
             whatever ""truth"" suits them into the growing cesspool of society
             at large.

Colonel    : The different cardinal truths neither clash nor mesh. No one is
             invalidated, but nobody is right.

Rose       : Not even natural selection can take place here. The world is
             being engulfed in ""truth.""

Colonel    : And this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a
             whimper.

Rose       : We're trying to stop that from happening.

Colonel    : It's our responsibility as rulers. Just as in genetics,
             unnecessary information and memory must be filtered out to
             stimulate the evolution of the species.

Raiden     : And you think you're qualified to decide what's necessary and

It’s a convincing theory. It centres around themes in the books such as hive minds (weirwood trees) and a few gods mentioned briefly. On the show he points out the Theta symbol that the White Walkers make in the first episode with body parts, Sansa wears a massive golden Theta necklace in series 5 or 6 and the carvings of Thetas on the cave wall on Dragonstone in series 7. Thetas are the symbol of a powerful human army in “thousand worlds” and crop up on many different planets.

“Thousand worlds” are great stories and there’s a huge part of the in-universe history called “the interregnum” - this is where after various wars: the various human planets in the empire fall out of communication with each other, lose space travel and fall into horrible decline. Planets stuck in “the interregnum” often fall back to medieval technology. Preston Jacob’s theory is that Planetos is stuck in “the interregnum” and hasn’t relearnt space travel or been liberated/reenergised by a more advanced planet.

It’s a cool theory, that I personally believe, even if the books/show never make it clear.       
It would explain the magic in the show as incredibly advanced technology that no one on Planetos can possibly understand.

No it didn't.  That is the same article I linked.  The best the academics can tell is that skilled workers got a pay bump, people moderately skilled stayed the same (more pay, less hours.  Arguably this is better but it isn't more money), and low skilled workers couldn't get jobs compared to outside seattle county.  Is that what you call a success?  I call that:  

&gt;high  minimum wages hurt low skilled workers 

The berkeley study only looks at fast food workers.  If you apply the same methodology in seattle you get the same answer.  But if you look at ALL low wage labor, you get a different one.  Here is where I could complain about the liberal bias of the berkeley school of economics but it isn't necessary.  Their study and methodology simply don't answer the question asked.  They answer a different question about fast food workers.

And my point is you both help and hurt when you raise the minimum wage.  And the ones you hurt are the lowest skilled workers.

It isn't even clear what position you are taking only that you disagree with mine.  So I assume you think labor prices don't matter and never cause harm.

You don't even care if minimum wage laws might hurt the poorest workers.  You say we'll vote in universal basic income as if that pays the bills for those people in seattle *right now.*  And the worst part, to me, is that you care so little about these people that you insult someone who would even dare to tell you that they might be hurt by minimum wage increases.  Being righteous doesn't make you right, and passing laws intending to help doesn't mean they will help.

Now they've increased the study in six more locations -- the economy is doing fine; https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/minimum-wage-increases-in-six-cities-working-as-intended-berkeley-study-of-food-service-jobs-finds/

&gt;Wage floors have continued climbing and are higher and more widespread now, with 10 major cities, seven states, and dozens of other local governments passing laws to boost minimum wages to between $12 and $15 an hour in the coming years, eventually covering more than a fifth of the U.S. workforce.

&gt;On average across the six cities studied, “a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage increases earnings in the food services industry between 1.3 and 2.5 percent,” the researchers found.

&gt;The Berkeley team said in a news release that their study “casts further doubt” on the 2017 findings of University of Washington researchers that Seattle’s minimum wage increase led to fewer hours and jobs for low-wage workers.

The think tanks and conservative media outlets do not want people to be empowered -- they don't want people to know that the economy is driven by demand -- and higher wages creates more demand -- not lower taxes.

Right. You started off responding to my levity with derogatory comments towards me and telling me I don't know what I'm talking about. I always consider that I might be wrong. Stop projecting what you are guilty of on other people.

If raising wages causes people to lose jobs -- then we vote and we give those people a Universal Basic Income. We spent $2 trillion just last year on rich people -- we have the money. Because current minimum wage is impossible to live on. Somehow you are OK with that. ""At least they have jobs"". Yes, people with jobs get evicted all the time. I see it every day.

But you’re assuming a lot. They’re going to be prohibitively expensive. There are many parts of the world that lack access to what are now considered basic public resources in developed nations, and you’re talking about using high-tech androids to replace them in menial labor. It’s sci-fi nonsense that won’t become reality for centuries. 

*There is no higher power telling us humans are the superior species and should reign at the top with everyone else below us...*

There isn’t, we’ve become the governing force on Earth by our own will. And no matter the possible benefits, we will never relinquish our control over this planet, especially not to things we’ve invented for convenience and problem-solving. 

*Those problems man can't seem to crack can most likely be solved in a matter of seconds with a heuristic thinking machine*

Oh, like the religious wars and civil unrest that still persists in large populations around the world? I’m sure the prospect of machines that can think and act like human beings will be really reassuring. Unveiling this tech as soon as it’s ready, and developing it with tenacity, would only start new issues within society. AI alone will take plenty of jobs over the next few decades. I see your point here (in terms of scientific discovery), but it won’t be as widespread as you think.

*Mind you most of these synths are made of metal and plastic so they would really have no opportunity to rebel*

Metal and plastic androids aren’t sufficient. Those would be even more separable from humans appearance-wise, and don’t hit the technological mark established in any of the films or games we’ve mentioned thus far. That’s the main feature of movies like Extinction and Westworld: androids (who are visually indistinguishable from humans) that question the nature of their reality, and start to develop their own concepts. Synthetic-biological organs blur the line between man and machine, not plastic-and-metal constructions with AI. It seems like you have really foggy ideas about all this. 

 *Once that boundary is broken then we possibly have every question ever worth answering answered.*

No, you just have an artificial intelligence that thinks better than a human. Human society represents a patchwork of complex understandings about the world around us, and a simulation of our consciousness would just be better at comprehending it in certain ways. 

*If a being has developed sentience and an intelligence level similar to that of humans then I say we have no right to treat them as lesser beings. Sure we can stop making them, but once they're made there is no ethical way of getting rid of the ones we got* 

I don’t think we will produce human-like androids at all, at least not for a while after we’ve figured out how to. This technology is inherently dangerous and has the potential to upset humanity’s order on this planet; whole societies and worldviews, gone. More so, it won’t see the light of day until long after we’re dead.

There is no higher power telling us humans are the superior species and should reign at the top with everyone else below us.

Wanting to kill anything that dares challenge us is a primitive way of progressing as a species. Using these challenges as building blocks to further ourselves even more is far more logical if we would like to prolong ourselves indefinitely. 

Those problems man can't seem to crack can most likely be solved in a matter of seconds with a heuristic thinking machine. The ability for a robot to think heuristically could be the easiest way to slingshot into Nirvana. 

Humans are still infinitely smarter than any machine because machines can't think, they can look at a flow chart and recite it back to us instantaneously but they can't put the flow chart into context and tell us why it acts the way it does.

1302,,ImPolicy,,,,,,,,t2_38he29o,,,"I've read the source material multiple times and done significant analysis on it. My own personal feeling on the subject matter is that it is fundamentally about information and control of it, and as a second major theme the corruption of a formerly noble public service of the Firefighter. 

This story is also couched in the philisophical thematic question of what it means to be human, namely happinness versus freedom or ""chains"" versus freedom (Kafka). What does it mean to be ""free""? And what is the price? Let me say here that Franz Kafka The Trial is my favorite book, so I can appreciate these themes. 

One noticeably conspicuous missing part in this adaptation is the machine dog that chases Montag (Boston Dynamics comes to mind). But, maybe the more pertinent elements are there, the control of people through control of information, the perversion of the noble Firefighter social function, and the nature of happinness, and freedom.

Also present is the Author's opinion on his own work, a book he (Bradbury) wrote in 12 days in the basement of a UCLA library. His primary point on the work, afterwards, was that it was the people themselves who were the genesis of oppression, not ""the government"". This is interesting if looked at from the philisophical perspective of what it means to be human. Is Bradbury saying we are bound to self-oppress in order to be happy? It's not an easily answered question.

Given the subject material and the outstanding questions it raises I suppose I can understand why the general public could be alienated by this adaptation  (Rotten Tomatoes is at 36%). However, we should keep in mind that even the great Tom Hanks film on the subject ""The Circle"" was almost DOA. I suspect that given the themes F-451 covers beforehand people might enjoy it much more, but I could be wrong. 

What also came to mind while experiencing this 21st century retelling of the story of control of a population through control of information, which was at least partially inspired by the burning of libraries in ancient Egypt, is the domestication of fire and how it was a civilizational boon for humanity. And in this fable we turn that life supporting life affirming social technology into a fearsome tool of destruction and therefore control of information and populations. 

Now, being that we are in the 21st century what is the next ""fire"" that we have learned to domesticate? I would argue that it is *power*. We have domesticated power in social systems. We accomplished this as a prime example in the American Democratic Constitutional Republic frameworks known as the Founding Documents, somewhat based on the Iroquois Confederacy, a framework that functions primarily to *balance powers*. What is the phrase? ""You have to be careful with power because it will but you"" and, ""it is the job of intelligence to speak truth to power"". The movie talked of truth multiple times as well. 

In the future, as we continue to fight over information, will we invert our balance of powers schema the way Bradbury inverts the Firefighter function? The corruption of that critical node imo is what makes this story so profound. After all, there have been many stories about corruption and control of populations through control of information, but not like this.

The American system of control; primarily through its core mainframe-work of founding documents, specifically the concepts of property, self-determination, happinness, and balance of powers, could also be inverted like the firefighter function. Could this be accomplished through abolishing campaign contribution limits? Abolishing net neutrality protections? Establishing a Universal Basic Income? Or an insidious combination of these? 

The timelessness of control of information is evident when this classic about burning books can be almost seemlessly adopted backwards to Ancient Egypt or forward to a mature 21st century Information Age (Age Of Interconnectedness). This movie adaptation asks difficult questions but doesn't do us the disservice of pretending that it has the answers, and for that, as well as reminding us that we are in constant struggle to be free, and happy, and have self-determination (choice), for those reasons I really admire this work and the people who made it possible. I don't think it was made for populist consumption, as much as I love the MCU as a good example of populist art.

Logan's Run

Ghost In The Shell

Robo-Cop

AI

These movies used real science to back their assertions. Within what is possible in physic's as we know them, and in times far reaching impact. These movies spoke to truth and logical presumptions, not fantasy desires or radically unproven concepts that mislead the public at large.

Pandorum, squeak's in for this list. It deals with hyper-sleep stasis and interstellar travel (which is all horseshit to me), but it also accentuates a danger in genetic tampering even with good intentions. I say that travel between stars will end in failure in a variety of ways. Allow me to explain.

A. The concept of ion engines and light speed travel is quite mad. As avoidance countermeasures for objects in space would be useless at those speeds even with quantum computing, and the ship would likely strike something before arrival at it's destination. See  ""circumstellar debris disk"".

B. At conventional speeds, sleeping to a destination is not realistic either. As the ship would require maintenance that can't be entirely relied on by robots or fully automated systems. Pandorum, did a good job there, by having a regulated 'sleep - wake' cycle for it's crew, but the concept itself of possibly tedium or paranoia leading to crew mental breakdowns is a likely outcome of extended life via long hibernation stents.

C. Regulated waking life and sleeping via a day/night hourly cycle to simulate Earth conditions is optimal, but this adds the greatest peril to the colony ship. As conventional speed would take on the order of 1500-2000 years to reach our nearest star. It would mean that humanity in the form of an encapsulated society would need to exist 'peacefully' for that period of time without war. I submit, mankind is not up to that challenge as of yet, nor even in our distant future.

D. Physic's has been touted as the solution to these problems, but the theorized math has yet to be seriously converted into a working technology that could begin to approach warp, or wormhole creation to generate faster than light travel. These concepts are fantasy and purely in the realm of hopeful dreaming. Dimensional portals and photon bubbles just simply do not exist, and until working models of these technologies are devised one should err on the side of logic and consider them unrealistic in ones depictions of the future.

The rest of the movies need no grand explanations. They are straightforward and wear their assumptions on their sleeves. Logan's Run, is a genetic population and social management experiment much like, Aeon Flux, with an element of AI oversight lacking in the latter. Robo-Cop, a look at the merger of men and bio mechanical implants and the advantage of human mind in cybernetic bodies. AI, a pure summation of a world where men have given greater freedom and influence to non-human intellects, then examining the dangers and likely eventual end it could entail. Ghost In The Shell, like Robo-Cop, but it deals with regulation and security within a world of transhuman society, and makes good points about keeping the intellect an exclusively human attribute. The danger in advancing cold computer logic is that the logic of a computer will be very frigid. That might mean a complete disregard for human logic and concepts like loyalty, love and civility. I think most of us agree, only an idiot would choose to unleash that on his own species. I don't include Star-This, or Star-That, because they are childishly idealized fantasy concepts, not based in the reality we can subjectively say is within the assessment of the practicality of our proposed projects or systems for at least the next 1000 years.

1311,,EctoSage,,,[],,,,text,t2_ao73j,,,"I highly suspect that one day we will make machines far superior to us, or at least make ones, that will create synthetics that are greater than us.  
We are making progress now at creating machines that mimic human behavior to stimuli, we can simulate aspects of a  brain in a computer. Continue down this path, create ever more impressive simulations, building on what we know of organic life as a template, keep pressing forward breaking boundaries with new imventions, and we should eventually be able to build something on par with us. Our brains are proven to be similar to computers, but not ones run by code, least not in the digital sense, but of chemical reactions.  

Build a machine that creates the same result, but using a more simplistic digital means, would it not be alive? If you ask a man a question, and machine a machine a question; if you hurt both of them, or ignore both of them, and they react the same way- how can you say the machine is not conscious?  
Long as the machine isn't just using pre recorded loops, or completely prw-programmed responses(something humans do frequently), is it not alive and thinking?

As for a soul- I personally believe in one, but as I  mentioned above, I do believe in death, the soul moves on, while much of the conscious mind is lost.  
So, if we do create a machine that is conscious, have we created a soul?  
This mainly becomes a sticking point, because a machine can be turned off, and left off, but not be dead. If it did have a soul, what would happen at that point? Can a soul be trapped forever? Or, if it did have one, would the technology needed to create this level of mind be so michore than simulation, something involving quantum computing, that if powered down, would simply be lost, or destroyed? Would every reboot result in a different soul, or can only organics have that?  

There is only two ways to find out, speak to God, or create and study.  
I personally suspect our creation of advanced synthetic beings, will lead to them creating synthetic-organics. Geneticly engineered beings- that with any luck, might be able to understand existence at a deeper level than those that lead to their creation.

As to play God, I cannot help but feel it's what any Father would want for his children, to follow in his footsteps, using the wisdom he imparted to them.

Steve Bannon is in business with two of the people mentioned as facilitating Brain Singer's proclivities.

&gt;round the time Singer was finishing Apt Pupil and about to begin directing the first X-Men movie, he invested in a Hollywood start-up, Digital Entertainment Network, that would eventually end in scandal. Singer contributed $30,000 and pledged $20,000 more, according to records kept by the founding CEO, Marc Collins-Rector.

It's like the cryptomarket; it is dominated by altcoins in number of varieties and its total value in circulation dominates bitcoin by percentage, but market dominance percentage from an individual cryptocurrency is owned by bitcoin and no shitcoin can compete in direct comparison.

Surely the Korean box office or Bollywood is predominant in its country due to country's language/cultural preference and availability of films...because of course Korean movies will be more available within Korea, no shit there. But if a decent quality Hollywood or western film enters the theater, they can't compete in terms of gross revenue and just overall polishness. I give no fucks about the Transformer series, but given this new zombie film or Train To Busan in conjunction with a Transformer sequal, what would people watch? Both are action thrillers with the same family-value and sacrifice shit, but one would be significantly more polished than what ends up being yet another generic formulaic plot of a Korean drama in disguise. Shitcoins versus bitcoin man.

Back to my original point, this movie would likely end up being a mass zombiepocalypse plot involving the usual sacrificing for family type of plot, then I wouldn't even be disappointed because it's been done so many times with Korean films. Some movies like Old Boy I would watch them over any decent blockbusters, but I cannot expect much from all the formulaic Korean movies nowadays. I really hope for the better from the Korean film industry.

Spiderman was completely useless against the elementals even in theory. I mean, they even have a scene where he tries to shoot webs at the fire elemental and they burn up. And then Mysterio goes on to use water from a fire hydrant to battle the elemental. So.... in that case, Nick Fury who has every weapon conceivable and tons of money and superheros at his disposal is just like ""yeah instead of getting a bunch of high pressure hoses and other shit we will just prepare literally nothing despite having time and then just throw in a superhero who really has no useful powers against these creatures other than flying around with spider webs"" 

And then Peter has glasses that can read anything going on in electronic devices and has facial recognition, yet EDITH cannot recognize one of Starks former employees? It's said his name is made up, so then wouldn't EDITH have at least been like ""oh I can't be transferred to Quentin Beck because he doesn't exist/this is not him""? 

Then suddenly fucking Happy shows up in a jet that also has a damn suit generator. Gee, wouldn't that have been useful before? And then Peter goes on to not even make a useful suit. Yeah... you need to save the world and your friends, but definitely don't make the suit actually be able to fly or have any other extra features. Which I get they need to keep him as spiderman, and as such they should have not chosen a plot where it completely undermines logic and also make Nick Fury look stupid for insisting spiderman must be the one to help. And maybe you could argue Peter had EDITH at first.... but then that just points out more illogical writing as Peter didn't even harness the drones to help when the water element appeared....

And oh... Nick Fury is just all gung ho letting a person he knows nothing about take the lead in saving the entire fucking world. Like, I get they weren't going to bring in any of the other superheroes into this movie. However, as if Nick Fury would not at least have weapons and other things at his disposal. 

Also, when Peter and MJ realize Beck is bad Peter goes ""oh no can't use my phone it'll be tapped!"" Okay... so a pay phone or borrowing a phone won't do? Sending a drone with a message isn't good enough? I mean, logically Nick's phone would probably be compromised so maybe I can give it a pass. But they didn't make it a clear reason why he couldn't find another way or try to get us to forgive a huge budget movie using one of the lamest and laziest ways writers use to create more complication and drama. 

Then onto EDITH and Nick Fury. Like... yeah. Nick Fury doesn't want to help train Peter or anything. Hell, why even have him try them on to test it? Instead he can try them on the first time on a bus full of fellow students who aren't supposed to find out his identity. Then, surprisingly (/s) the teenager with no idea how a deadly and super powerful system works fucks up and almost kills people. 

Anyway... I could probably go on even more. I should also mention the almost amoeba-like intelligence of almost every secondary characters. And the cringey high school shit awkwardly shoehorned in for.... some reason? 

This movie is bad. It is bad because it follows no logic. They chose a ridiculous storyline for a movie that was going to have one singular superhero in it. If they had written it so that Nick Fury and everyone else didn't believe THE ENTIRE WORLD IS GOING TO BE DESTROYED IN DAYS but they somehow cannot get ANY of the much more powerful superheros involved or even use some of the incredibly advanced weapons and technology to help. Or at least made the creatures vulnerable to spiderman and his powers in any way... then all the other flaws could at least be forgiven. 

I guess, though, only reason this movie has managed to somehow trick people into believing it was good is probably because they made it so ""intense"" and fast moving with a huge threat and such little time. Then throw in a bunch of cool CGI and drop in some emotional shit here and there and for some reason this movie that is totally nonsensical is a hit. This isn't a storyline using bits of CGI and action to enhance it. It's CGI and action using bits of a storyline to hodge podge it into a sellable movie.

This is what killed the movie for me. I otherwise found it entertaining enough, not the best from Marvel, too much like a cartoon in parts, but not bad.

And then there's that non-sensical post credits scene that seemingly exists to hand wave away the question of how SHIELD/Fury were so stupid. Because it wasn't Fury at all, haha.

Basically, a few mathematicians discovered a long time ago that any signal can be broken down into an infinite set of sinusoids (sines or cosines), which are really simple to work with. Water waves are the most complicated form of waves, but they are mathematical and can be broken down into that infinite set of sinusoids.

On the physics side, researchers pretty much put buoys on the water and track their movements. That gives them, with some work, a formula for describing waves. There are a few of these formulas out there.

Now you need a way to work with one of these formulas on the computer. Well, as described before, any signal/waveform can be described as a sum of sinusoids. The main way to do that is called the Fourier Transform after Fourier the mathematician. (This is literally the way any piece of software works that does noise canceling: it breaks the sound signal down into its constituent parts, using a Fourier Transform, removes the noisy part, and stitches the signal back again using an Inverse Fourier Transform, before it reaches your ear.)

There are algorithms that does this really freaking fast, so you can have a resolution (amount of sine waves) in the millions in real time. Earlier, this technique was only used in offline rendering, such as movies (Titanic is a famous example).

This is a game that procedurally generates NPCs. That uses pre-set algorithms. There are parameters and variables that create the guidelines for each instantiated NPC object. Such parameters would be attributes, names, physical features, pathing routine, etc. 

Trying to identify each NPC that has a “bug” like that would be difficult (and probably wouldn’t make much sense for procedural generation). If they labeled those NPCs, that wouldn’t be easy at all. That would require adjusting their attribute assignments in the algorithm to match the propagation of the “bug” itself. 

If they are able to label each (procedurally generated) NPC with the “bug” that they may “die randomly” while knowing not to label NPCs without the “bug”, then they’ve already done MOST of the work in fixing the bug. From there, it’s literally just following the bread crumbs back to the source of the bug. 

Labeling NPCs with an attribute isn’t lazy. Ignoring the “bug” would be lazy. Just by my knowledge of how basic programming works tells me there isn’t any actual “bug” and it’s a legitimate feature (also my reading comprehension). 

If you can understand what goes into designing algorithms for procedural generation, then you’d realize that a dev turning a “bug” into a feature like this is a hell of a lot less likely than, I don’t know, an NPC that “hasn’t been to the doctor in 25 years” that’s supposed to have the attribute “may die randomly”. 

Please think about how complex systems like this work instead of relying on the context of analogies that don’t work at all. Cars aren’t generated procedurally. They’re made to all be the same from a factory. Identifying the problem is easy.

Nah I'm actually a huge fallout fan myself, but I'm a pretentious asshole about art stuff and have strong preferences for Avalon's stuff to Bethesda's stuff. I'll always be happy to grant though that 3 was the first of it's kind and a truly ground-breaking game and it's just a shame the main plot was weaker than 1 and 2, but with all the pros it has that's a minor grievance at best. And I was basically floored by how much I loved base building, weapon crafting, and every one of the companions, and also the Kellogg mind quest, especially in contrast to how I hated every other part of it, like the plot, the setting, the side quests, the implementation of base building, the loot algorithms, the leveling, the factions, and above all Preston. I've always felt though that while Bethesda generally delivers on the atmosphere in a big way they are basically a dumpster fire in the narrative department and Avalon's genius is sorely lacking.

So alright, I'll grant that exploring the huge map in 76 might be fun, but the question is, even as a fallout fan, is it worth it? Things like microtransactions are a threat to the industry and it will not and likely cannot self-regulate. Governments are stepping in now and I don't like that.

Ive no idea where that kid working picture is from. But certainly a failed  state couldnt protect that child from having to work, for example.

Id go even further. I bet there are many poor places in the world where children would beg for a opportunity to work. And thats not captalism's fault. Thats the world dude.

Life is hard. We are born without nothing and even if we are born in a good family, all we need is a little disaster. There are no protections in place to make sure a child will be provided for or someone will take care of them, for example. Is this capitalism os fault? No.

Capitalism is a word to define a system. This system isnt artificial like communism. It was born from trading and the necessity of a free market, to make things more fair.

Your cable example is a good example (in the USA afaik) of one of capitalism's problem. Monopoly/Oligopoly.

Dude if you have the absolute solution to monopoly/oligopoly please share with the world and win a nobel prize. Because its not a easy problem to solve. And it usually involves the state meddling in the market, which causes huge consequences and is often tainted with corruption.


Its not hard to understand the system is flawded. But its also not hard to understand that this is the best we have come up witg. And if you start doing basic things like:

- Putting up regulation = makes it HARDER for the small/poor to actually get into business because they have to invest more money to be able to open a business in said industry. Also raises inflation making products more expensive.

- Letting the state handle things = IMENSE amounts of corruption and inneficiency. I live in Brasil, I know very well the COST of the state.

- Raise taxes = Brazil has one of the highest taxes in the world. Come here visit us. Public things dont work all the time and public employees are usually not motivated to treat the population well. Also lots of corruption.

- You can say automation and moneyless world. But you have no proof this would work or wouldnt be exploited/corrupted. Or if its even possible.

So the solution to me seems:

Its us as a society that need to understand how the world works and decide where we want to spend our time and money.

I believe investing in child education (and care if needed) would be our best bet in the long term. They are also the part of our population witb the least means of surviving if left alone. And they have high life expectancy.

But this subject is extremelly complex, because we dont know the things we would have to teach our children to have positive outcomes in the long run. We can probably guess. Things like emotiinal intelligence, cience, management, money, entrepreneurial attitude, etc.

But the ever changing nature of the world (technology) makes lots of things obsolete.

Also we cant force or brainwash our children to follow a path we wish they followed. We can just do our best at education.

Also creating artificial brakes (state regulation) can have a catastrofical outcome.

We saw above how regulations make it even harder for the poor and also creates inflation. There is another problem too, everytime you regulate, you kinda give way part of your freedom to the state. And then its very easy for us to become slaves and live in an authoritarian place. 

No matter what we do, even then we wont be able to fix all problems, because resources are still limited.

My recommendation for people who want to LIVE in a different world is take action in making the world a better place. This means taking responsability. This means sacrificing your weekends to do charity, or creating something the world desperitly needs. Even then things csn go bad, because tools can be used for good or for evil.

* Each level is an underwater maze.

* Some don't have oxygen areas (so it's a race against the clock).

* Some levels feel super claustrophic, where it's you in an underwater cave. One of the times it caves in and there's no oxygen breaks.

* Every time Ecco gets hit, he makes an unearthly scream: [https://youtu.be/B1l9oFr8ZW8?t=65](https://youtu.be/B1l9oFr8ZW8?t=65) It's very high pitched. And he makes it every single time.

* Freaky music. It's ominous, it's really pretty cool as an adult, but it's all serious and creepy when you're a kid.

* Freakier enemies. The main bad guys are H.R. Giger inspired Aliens, like from the movie Alien. Tentacle monsters. The rest of the sea creatures (sharks, jellyfish, etc). Sea crabs that basically jump scare you by coming out of the walls like spiders. A mucus like eyeball monster. A giant tentacle thing.

* One level after you've rescued all of life in the ocean, your fellow dolphins included, you are transformed into a school of fish. Then all of your allies get hungry and try to eat you while you swim through the underwater maze. 

Then there's the whole back story. So the game is named ECCO. But it is all based off Dr. John Lilly. Lilly invented the sensory deprivation tank. He then began researching into large brained mammals, with a deeper eventual focus on the dolphin. Apparently, he flooded his house with ocean water to get dolphins to live with him. He wanted  to learn about dolphin-human communication. He began using hallucinogen drugs, LSD, and took an affinity to ketamine, which he called ""Vitamin K"". He'd take these drugs and use the sensory deprivation tank, increasingly upping the doses and time in.  

On one of his Ketamine trips in the sensory deprivation tank he came into contact with an alien collective known as the Earth Coincidence Control Office. The anagram (ECCO). He stated they oversaw Earth affairs and were benevolent towards humanity. He also met with an evil entity.

The evil entity was known as the Solid State Entity or Solid State Intelligence. That it came to Lilly from a far away mechanical solar system during one of his Ketamine trips in the isolation tank. The SSE is an artificial intelligence that exists with the goal of copying itself endlessly. It, according to Dr. Lilly, wants to guide man on a suicide course as it seeks to rid the Earth of all organic life. It doesn't need a significant atmosphere to exist, so it would do away with this (oceans and atmosphere) to integrate the planet as part of it's power source and manufacturing base. He even went so far as to contact President Ford, yes this was in the 70s when he had this idea, and was almost committed. Almost. He documented it in his 1978 book.

Thinking that OP meant the character somehow had some evolved intelligence, recognized something was a footstep, deduced that the footsteps likely came from an enemy, understood the direction of the steps by the shape, and followed the steps because they figured it would help them find the enemy...all on their own without any pre-programming...well, that would be a pretty big insult to OP's intelligence, and explaining that it isn't is almost demeaning.

While I agree this isn't AI in the modern sense, but when talking about how NPC's act, that's the term that's been used for decades.  It's the colloquial AI to describe NPC actions in almost all games ever made.  It was used to describe ""pretending to be intelligent.""

As somebody who dabbles in AI, I understand the difference between that and something like a neural network.  However, tell me of **any** game that truly uses AI to ""see"" or ""recognize"" anything, which isn't just a scripted reaction to line-of-sight or ray-traced line-of-sight.

I challenge you to explain to me how programming a NPC to ""identify"" footsteps and follow the path array set by your character is any more or less AI than programming a NPC to ""see"" anything else in any modern game.

&gt;20Q is a computerized game of [twenty questions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_questions) that began as a test in [artificial intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI). It was invented by Robin Burgener in 1988.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/20Q#cite_note-goddard-1) The game was made handheld by [Radica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radica) in 2004

&gt;The 20Q AI uses an [artificial neural network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to pick the questions and to guess.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/20Q#cite_note-goddard-1)[[4]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/20Q#cite_note-4) After the player has answered the twenty questions posed (sometimes fewer), 20Q makes a guess. If it is incorrect, it asks more questions, then guesses again. It makes guesses based on what it has learned; it is not programmed with information or what the inventor thinks. 

&gt;The built Artificial Neural Network is not resource intensive either to store or to compute, thus it could be embedded in small, less powerful devices. Currently, there is a [handheld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_console) version of the AI.

1424,[],aixenprovence,,,[],,,,text,t2_f20m3,False,,"&gt; we've only just scratched the surface with quantum computers

With regard to quantum computing, in order to get a really useful quantum computer, there is a requirement for qbits to be segregated from the rest of the universe to an extent which is infeasible for the time being.

[Here](http://fortune.com/longform/business-quantum-computing/) is a good article about it.  The bit of the article where they joke that quantum computing is five years away, and always will be, aligns with my suspicions.

For an example of how I interpret this kind of hype, [here](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/what-should-we-learn-past-ai-forecasts#The_peak_of_AI_hype) is a prediction made by an AI researcher in 1962:

&gt; A baby is a very complicated ‘device’, a product of billions of years of evolution, but only a million of those years were spent in human form. Consequently our main problem is perhaps to program or build a machine with the latent intelligence of a small lizard, totally unable to play draughts. A small lizard is handicapped by having a small brain. If we could build a machine with the latent intelligence of a small lizard, then, at many times the expense, we could probably build one with that of a baby. With a further small percentage increase in cost we could reach the level of the baby Newton and better. We could then educate it and teach it its own construction and ask it to design a far more economical and larger machine. At this stage there would unquestionably be an explosive development in science, and it would be possible to let the machines tackle all the most difficult problems of science… For what it is worth, my guess of when all this will come to pass is 1978, and the cost of $10(8.7 ± 1.0).

My only point is that, for some types of problems, I think it's a good idea to assume this isn't working until someone actually demonstrates real, non-fictional success.  Popular articles that discuss technologies that _aren't here quiiiite yet_ should make you a little suspicious.

Quantum computing and generalized artificial intelligence are two examples of that kind of problem.  They are difficult in ways that other problems are not difficult.  Get excited when someone actually:

 * Demonstrates quantum supremacy...
 * ... In a way that unlocks a problem we can't solve using classical computers.

[Here](https://science.slashdot.org/story/00/08/15/1420211/ibm-develops-quantum-computer?sdsrc=next) is a post from Slashdot **from 2000** talking about how IBM made a kinda-sorta quantum computer with 5 qbits, leading a reader to ask [this](https://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=7098&amp;cid=854655):

&gt; I wonder what's going to happen to us programmers. I had heard a while ago in Scientific American that programming Quamtum Computers required a radically different approach than those used today. I wonder how much different it will be, and how us ""old-timers"" will deal with it.

[Here](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/02/quantum/) is an article **from 2007** about a demo by D-Wave with kinda sorta quantum computer, claiming quantum computing would be here Real Soon Now.

With these kinds of problems, if someone claims that success is _juuuuust_ over the horizon, I claim you should assume we're still stuck.

But it was still a fantasy setting in 6. The magitek was just a type of research they were working on to tap the power of the espers for everyday use (and also weapons. lots of weapons.)

FF7 flipped the switch in to a more sci-fi setting that also has magic. It stopped being about knights and mages and was about soldiers and people who bought magic gems that let anyone use magic. You had giant mechanical cities. You had a plot entirely focused on aliens and genetic engineering.

FF8 turned full sail in to that storm that FF7 started. Just gave the whole dingy machinery aesthetic a shiny paint job. Still, had a plot involving... very convoluted overly emo anime crap. Time Travel (am I remembering that one correct?), actual space travel, massive magitek school/city/military base things.

FF9 took things a step back in the direction away from FF7, but it didn't do as well, probably because a lot of people were first exposed to Final Fantasy with FF7 and it didn't feel like the same kind of game. It still had some tech aspects to it, but it was very medieval and magical, definitely a fantasy setting.

FF10 moved back toward the tech side but not as much as FF7, though it did move back to the FF7/8 anime aesthetic. Most of the magitek in the game is expressed as more of a lost civilization tech in a fantasy world.

FF11 was pretty much all fantasy. There were some very minor tech aspects in it, like hexaguns and things like that, but that was about it.

FF12, moved back toward FF7 even more than FF10 did. A lot more tech and its modern tech but it has a nice balance and still feels like a fantasy setting for a game.

FF13 just went full ham with the tech crap. The whole world is super advanced. They beat you over the head with it at every opportunity too.

FF14 has the magitek, but it feels more like an extension of how FF6 set things up. You have 1 nation that uses the magitek technology, they get robot armor and gunblades and things like that, but the rest of the world uses magic, swords, knights, etc. There's a lot of tech sorta floating in the background from various lost civilizations and whatnot but it still has that fantasy feeling.

FF15 just said fuck it. We're sci-fi again. Took everything about FF13, removed all the dumb made-up words for random shit and just kinda kept the monsters sorta just running around in the wild. Magic's just kinda a thing you can mine and keep in bottles. Back in hard sci-fi territory.

It's interesting how this discussion draws parallels with universal basic income as that would predominantly be a socialist policy.

Either the world finds a way to embrace UBI or enjoy huge waves of homelessness epidemics, automation is in full swing. Even in basic forms such as self serve checkouts wiping out a ton of jobs and recently more and more robotics automating past industrial/warehouse even office jobs.

The core of arguments against UBI I've read typically boil down to ""fuck you i got mine you gotta earn yours"" except when automation has completely eliminated the vast majority of unskilled labor to the degree where there simply are No jobs available. 

What then? UBI. or watch crime rates shoot up as folks get desperate for food, water and shelter.

It's very strange people are against these kinds of socialist policy's and ideas that benefit everyone, shouldn't we be happy that all these crappy jobs can be automated so we can be freed up to work towards fulfilling, creative, beneficial work? 

We have the possibility for a new renaissance here but we're stuck in the old mentality of ""how dare the next generation have it easier than me, they should work themselves to death just like i did and my father before me""

&amp;#x200B;

To your comment though i don't think anyone is seriously arguing for 125k a year to everyone for free and such, more so a livable UBI for all.

Why hire and pay for hundreds when you can have a skeleton crew and a one time payment for robotics with Far cheaper upkeep that does the job Better? machines don't need to sleep.

Will there be folks who exploit and stay happy at the lowest level on UBI? Yes. 

Ideally a system in place by committees of experts who specialize in these fields could help alleviate abuse but no idea how that's solved, historically that's never been solved barring severe atrocities or extreme homelessness.

Personally id rather the junkie has shelter, food and water instead of sleeping on the curb waiting to mug the next passerby, also [decriminalisation](https://youtu.be/kP15q815Saw?t=321) (5:21) is massively effective at curbing the common problems with junkies and addicts alike.

Why do I say this and what are those caveats? Well, this isn't the place for a full thesis on the matter, but basically:

1) From an ecological perspective minimising the resource expenditure of moving goods from source to consumer has to be a priority. If we can get a decent drone delivery system going, from centralised distribution centres to homes, that's got to be a vast improvement on our current set-up.

2) Reducing the number of vendors means less inefficiency/wastage in all sorts of ways, including packaging and marketing. Obviously this is entirely antithetical to the fundamentals of capitalism including the idea of the beneficial ""invisible hand"" - but I'm operating on the basis that capitalism needs some serious tweaking if we're going to make it at all. Rather than having, say, five supermarkets serving one community and competing against each other, let's just have one - and ensure that quality control is up to scratch. People who complain about lack of choice need to realise that choice is one of the things that's killing us right now.

3) Reducing the number of links in the supply chain means it's easier for the state to monitor and enforce compliance with sustainability- and quality-focussed legislation. It would also be very easy to counter complaints about the abuse of monopsony powers by setting prices for key types of good (most importantly, food) at a regional level. Take away large retailers' power to drive down the prices they pay farmers.

4) Jobs would disappear in huge numbers - but they will regardless. A universal basic income is imperative, along with a fundamental reassessment of the very nature and purpose of employment. 

Of course there are countless more elements than this; fundamentally though we have to make huge changes to the way we obtain the things we eat, drink and use, and in order for those changes to work we've got to strengthen, not reduce, the power of the state.",1555187771,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ektmcwq,False,t3_bcsrzu,,True,t1_ektbori,/r/gaming/comments/bcsrzu/local_video_game_shop_support_small_businesses/ektmcwq/,1555187781.0,1,True,,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,,,1555326098.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1513,[],aixenprovence,,,[],,,,text,t2_f20m3,False,,"&gt; we've only just scratched the surface with quantum computers

With regard to quantum computing, in order to get a really useful quantum computer, there is a requirement for qbits to be segregated from the rest of the universe to an extent which is infeasible for the time being.

[Here](http://fortune.com/longform/business-quantum-computing/) is a good article about it.  The bit of the article where they joke that quantum computing is five years away, and always will be, aligns with my suspicions.

For an example of how I interpret this kind of hype, [here](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/what-should-we-learn-past-ai-forecasts#The_peak_of_AI_hype) is a prediction made by an AI researcher in 1962:

&gt; A baby is a very complicated ‘device’, a product of billions of years of evolution, but only a million of those years were spent in human form. Consequently our main problem is perhaps to program or build a machine with the latent intelligence of a small lizard, totally unable to play draughts. A small lizard is handicapped by having a small brain. If we could build a machine with the latent intelligence of a small lizard, then, at many times the expense, we could probably build one with that of a baby. With a further small percentage increase in cost we could reach the level of the baby Newton and better. We could then educate it and teach it its own construction and ask it to design a far more economical and larger machine. At this stage there would unquestionably be an explosive development in science, and it would be possible to let the machines tackle all the most difficult problems of science… For what it is worth, my guess of when all this will come to pass is 1978, and the cost of $10(8.7 ± 1.0).

My only point is that, for some types of problems, I think it's a good idea to assume this isn't working until someone actually demonstrates real, non-fictional success.  Popular articles that discuss technologies that _aren't here quiiiite yet_ should make you a little suspicious.

Quantum computing and generalized artificial intelligence are two examples of that kind of problem.  They are difficult in ways that other problems are not difficult.  Get excited when someone actually:

 * Demonstrates quantum supremacy...
 * ... In a way that unlocks a problem we can't solve using classical computers.

[Here](https://science.slashdot.org/story/00/08/15/1420211/ibm-develops-quantum-computer?sdsrc=next) is a post from Slashdot **from 2000** talking about how IBM made a kinda-sorta quantum computer with 5 qbits, leading a reader to ask [this](https://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=7098&amp;cid=854655):

&gt; I wonder what's going to happen to us programmers. I had heard a while ago in Scientific American that programming Quamtum Computers required a radically different approach than those used today. I wonder how much different it will be, and how us ""old-timers"" will deal with it.

[Here](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/02/quantum/) is an article **from 2007** about a demo by D-Wave with kinda sorta quantum computer, claiming quantum computing would be here Real Soon Now.

With these kinds of problems, if someone claims that success is _juuuuust_ over the horizon, I claim you should assume we're still stuck.

1536,[],birchmark,,,[],,,,text,t2_sklik,False,,"For the most part I agree but I don't agree with ""Charge whatever you want for whatever you want"". I think pay to win and other shitty types of microtransactions are wrong in any game regardless of if it is free or not. If you just met within the area of cosmetics, I agree, but not other ones. 

A one off purchase of an app or program to both stop ads and add some features or alternatively unlock more content isn't bad either (I intend to do the one off payment to unlock all of code combat myself - which is browser not mobile) but stuff where you spend money to get better gear etc especially if it is in a game universe where that will affect other people isn't ever really right to me, unless the game revolves around money / cryptocurrency in the first place and players are selling stuff to each other etc which is different because that's between players instead of paying the game itself (other than transaction fee / gas price) and those sorts of games are really a genre of their own since they directly deal with / basically run on currency that can become real money. Some games one player advancing doesn't affect another so if it's essentially a character boost thing or something sure, but even in single player or multiplayer where one person's advancement doesn't affect others in any significant way, if it's like ""you can't choose this option from two options unless you pay"" (episode does this - seen a couple of people playing it simply because the game is bad and I think that is predatory and wrong and playing roblox with my nephew, I've seen similar things, including one game that wouldn't let us have a four person party without paying for the ability to do so which is shit). To me, nothing like this is okay in a game, free or otherwise. 

As for dlc, it can be pretty shitty too. The expansions that add gameplay are great and I've bought them before, but often the stuff packs for the sims of an version are way overpriced for essentially dolls clothes and some furniture. I'm a long term fan of the sims but I think the ones of their expansion packs that don't add to the gameplay are a bigger rip off than something from the fortnite store would be even if I paid for fortnite br. Ark doesn't change much with their expansions either. It's a new map admittedly, but it often doesn't add to the gameplay much. We got some of them when they were on special but we wouldn't have paid full price. If my only option was paying full price, one of the dlcs I probably wouldn't get, but if the light pug creature was a much smaller cost (a microtransaction) to get on his own, I probably would have done that and would have been happier with that than paying for the whole thing.

Generally if you pay for a game it should all be there and be updated without extra cost unless it's a big change (ie an actually worthwhile dlc). I like that overwatch updates and adds new things rather than charging for dlc (though it does have microtransactions but tbh it was only recently I even found out that you can buy the loot boxes - I've always just earned them and since they give you in game currency instead of double ups, I like the fact they are loot boxes - it's like a kinder surprise in a game, but it would be annoying as a paid thing) but dlc can be good when done well. I don't know what to expect from overwatch 2 honestly. It could be exciting but it could be a move away from adding new content into existing games like they have been doing with overwatch and given there's been structural and business changes, that concern is larger. 

Wow is the one game I feel comfortable enough with the fact they charge to buy expansions / dlc, charge a subscription and also have optional purchases of character boosts and mounts and pets etc (especially given the mounts and pets are normally for charity). Wow just adds enough per expansion for me to see subscription plus charging for dlc to be acceptable (we only really buy time when we want it though, rather than stay on subscription). Very few games would make me find that combo acceptable. 

Generally my stance is, for a free to play game, add microtransactions but still don't do it in dicky or predatory ways - for me, whether it is free or not does not change this - but for other games, for the most part they shouldn't have microtransactions (unless it's a charity thing) or ads, but they also shouldn't release dlc that's not worth what they are charging either. If they are going to have one or the other, most of the time dlc will be better but there are cases where optional microtransactions would be better for the consumer. In reality I guess it comes down to quality and what devs are intending to offer.

I honestly don't think fortnite fits into the bad category here (not saying you do, basing that on actual post and how people complain about it). It's free, everything you can buy is cosmetic or is the battle pass which only unlocks cosmetic things and v bucks, and each battle pass if completed earns you more vbucks than the cost of the next seasons battle pass, and it updates regularly too (though I would also still be happy if they did it slightly less to be easier on their devs as their workload was harsh but even if they dropped it back a reasonable amount it would still get updated more than a lot of other games). Depending on if I decide I really want something and can't afford it and the next battle pass from the v bucks, I either spend nothing per season or about 10 - 15 dollars per season (getting one of the packs that includes skin plus vbucks as they usually turn out better value than just buying vbucks). We also spent quite a while running around as defaults not spending a cent. I don't think anything I've bought on fortnite so far was a waste or a mistake, but while we did have fun with it at times, I kind of feel like buying pubg was a mistake (we had pubg before fortnite) because it was buggy at the time, but even more recently, every time I try to give it another chance it's still incredibly buggy. I understand an individual not liking fortnite for whatever reason (someone I know doesn't like any games with cartoony graphics or themes) but I don't really get bashing it beyond ""I don't like that personally"" because it seems to be doing a pretty good job at how it does it all really. Could it be better?

SIM swapping requires pretty little effort unfortunately. Anyone can be a target and everyone is frankly vulnerable, but it's more of a risk for people in the public eye. All someone needs is your phone number and any other information they have will make the process easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Generally, this works through a process similar to the one I'll list below,

1. Find a target. Generally targets are randomly chosen based on specific factors (ex: cryptocurrency users were targeted recently), but some people will target random phone numbers or celebrities.
2. Gather any information relating to your target. The more the better.
3. Call the carrier and social engineer the representative into swapping the SIM to a new phone. If they refuse, keep calling back to speak to someone new.
4. After swapping, you have total access to their phone. You can easily recover other accounts now and find more vulnerable information. For example, you can recover an email using a phone number and use that email to now figure out where they bank at. Once they figure this out, they already have your email and phone number so they could either call the back posing as you or request a password reset.",1563294162,{},etx8y3z,False,t3_cdqosg,False,True,t1_etw9zvs,/r/gaming/comments/cdqosg/ill_try_again_sony_deleted_my_account_after/etx8y3z/,1563294165.0,1,True,,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,0.0,,1563380559.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*How many of you are aware of Blockchain and Crypto? It would be great to hear your thoughts about the new payment option.*

*My thoughts are that now the Fortnite community will be able to make purchases on the store even if they do not have a bank account or Credit Card, which surprisingly is still a good part of the population.*

*Another great positive is that if you, like many of us, spend far more money on our gaming habits than we want our families and friends to believe, now you will be able make purchases of your dorky Fortnite T-shirts without the prying eyes of your family or partners.*

*It looks to me like Video games and Crypto are beginning to go hand in hand with a lot of partnerships and platforms building on the Blockchain!*

Samsung doesn't care about user experience the concept is foreign to them, they are spec sheet warriors. Even on their more recent phones they had the fingerprint sensor either rectangular on the front (your finger is round) or they put it on the back way too close to the camera module so you smudge up your camera. Their facial recognition login is primitive and poorly executed, only using a camera that can be easily fooled. Their camera post effect portrait system just blurs the background evenly. 

Apple meanwhile uses proper 3D dot projection for Face ID, and the portrait mode detects distance as well and applies blur accordingly. Quality vs. spec sheet. 

And the stuff you can't see they give zero fucks about. Open up a Galaxy phone and compare the internals to an iPhone.

Why should they allow people to do anything? I'll give you an easy answer to this one: because Facebook is a speech medium and the easiest thing to do is allow anything that doesn't break the law or constitute hate speech. We don't need corporations to decide for us what's morally, ethically, and socially acceptable. Facebook is now bigger than TV at spreading information, yet you *want* them to regulate speech privately, giving them more control than any government over who's allowed to say what? I'm not comfortable doing that.

&gt;That's a silly and one sided view.

No, it isn't. Don't be patronizing.

&gt;Prior to 2016 it wasn't an issue that was being vastly exploited.

Except it was. Botting and shilling has been going on for far longer than 3 years. It's not that it wasn't an issue, it's that the public didn't talk about it. And you know why they started talking about it? Because aligned communications corporations encouraged us to start talking about it.

I'm not going to call it a conspiracy, because it wasn't a conspiratorial decision. It was just a decision that was in the best interest of everyone with aligned interests. But it was definitely a shared interest of all left-aligned communications organizations to speak out against an information method that was hurting their bottom line. We shouldn't confuse corporate politics with ethics.

&gt;Yes. And that's why I'm strongly against it and why companies like Facebook should not allow people to create fake identities and manipulate traffic on their platform. It has real world consequences and can even be a national security issue.

Based on what? The Mueller Report, or something else? Can you definitively prove that political bots on Facebook are more dangerous than privately-owned communication media at restricting and manipulating human thought?

Google claims to have built the first [quantum computer](https://www.ft.com/content/154a1cf4-ad07-11e8-94bd-cba20d67390c)  that can carry out calculations beyond the ability of today’s most  powerful supercomputers, a landmark moment that has been hotly  anticipated by researchers. 

A paper by Google’s researchers seen  by the FT, that was briefly posted earlier this week on a Nasa website  before being removed, claimed that their processor was able to perform a  calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds that would take today’s  most advanced classical computer, known as Summit, approximately 10,000  years. 

The researchers said this meant the “quantum supremacy”,  when quantum computers carry out calculations that had previously been  impossible, had been achieved. 

“This dramatic speed-up relative  to all known classical algorithms provides an experimental realisation  of quantum supremacy on a computational task and heralds the advent of a  much-anticipated computing paradigm,” the authors wrote. 

“To our knowledge, this experiment marks the first computation that can only be performed on a quantum processor.”

The system can only perform a single, highly technical  calculation, according to the researchers, and the use of quantum  machines to solve practical problems is still years away. 

But the  Google researchers called it “a milestone towards full-scale quantum  computing”. They also predicted that the power of quantum machines would  expand at a “double exponential rate”, compared to the exponential rate  of Moore’s Law, which has driven advances in silicon chips in the first  era of computing.

While prototypes of so-called quantum computers  do exist, developed by companies ranging from IBM to start-ups such as  Rigetti Computing, they can only perform the same tasks classical  computers can, albeit quicker. 

Quantum computers, if they can be  built at scale, will harness properties that extend beyond the limits of  classical physics to offer exponential gains in computing power.

A November 2018 [report](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/next-decade-quantum-computing-how-play.aspx)  by the Boston Consulting Group said they could “change the game in such  fields as cryptography and chemistry (and thus material science,  agriculture and pharmaceuticals) not to mention artificial intelligence  and machine learning . . . logistics, manufacturing, finance and  energy”.

Unlike the basic binary elements of classical computers,  or bits, which represent either zeros or ones, quantum bits, or qubits,  can represent both at the same time. By stringing together qubits, the  number of states they could represent rises exponentially, making it  possible to compute millions of possibilities instantly.

Some  researchers have warned against overhyping the quantum supremacy,  arguing that it does not suggest that quantum machines will quickly  overtake traditional computers and bring a revolution in computing.

Led  by John Martinis, an experimental physicist from the University of  California, Santa Barbara, Google first predicted it would reach quantum  supremacy by the end of 2017. But the system it built, linking together  72 qubits proved too difficult to control.

It eventually revamped  the system to create a 53-qubit design it codenamed Sycamore. The  system was given the task of proving that a random-number generator was  truly random. Though that job has little practical application, the  Google researchers said that “other initial uses for this computational  capability” included machine learning, materials science and chemistry.

“It’s  a significant milestone, and the first time that somebody has shown  that quantum computers could outperform classical computers at all,”  said Steve Brierley, founder of quantum software start-up Riverlane, who  has worked in the field for 20 years and is an adviser on quantum  technologies to the UK government. “It’s an amazing achievement.”

Well I've just ""lost interest"" in being civil with you then. You are a complete idiot who knows nothing about artificial intelligence, nothing about neuroscience and nothing about physics. You are the kind of person that ""loses interest"" whenever someone with more than 20 seconds of experience in any of these topics calls them out on their uneducated, idiotic bullshit.

&gt;Discrete means that the process uses fixed inputs.

No, that is not what discrete means. Discrete means non-continuous. Simple example: the function f(x)=2x is certainly not discrete, but it certainly uses fixed inputs - presumable real numbers in this case.

&gt;Deterministic outcomes are only possible from discrete inputs.

Right... **No**. You can always predict the result of f(x)=2x but that doesn't have discrete inputs. It is a deterministic problem with non-discrete inputs.

&gt; Even things that appear random are not

Is what we thought 100 years ago. Then the theory of quantum mechanics was proposed and then proven. Explain the results of the double slit experiment in a fully deterministic universe then.

&gt;A RNG is not truly random 

Either we are for some incomprehensible reason suddenly talking about modern or obsolete implementations of random number generators or you're wrong.

&gt;Every part of the RNG uses discrete inputs at every stage

Of what RNG? I can certainly describe an algorithm that generates pseudo-random numbers (like the ones you describe) from non-discrete inputs and I'm not particularly smart. **Why are we now talking about this?!?**

&gt;And if you were god you would know all the inputs and be able to predict the output of the RNG.

Not in this universe but I want to mention that I have no idea why we are talking about determinism now. Do you just admit that you were completely wrong about everything in your previou comment and would like to move on to an entirely unrelated topic but also save face? You could have just asked!

&gt;If you think somehow the brain operates in a mystical fashion and doesn't use discrete values in its logic gates and doesn't have deterministic outputs, unlike every single other natural process we have come to understand, you'd have to explain why and give some kind of proof. 

I am not interested in this discussion and that is something I never claimed. I will also not make a claim either way now because in the end I just don't know and I'm not stupid and arrogant enough to pretend I do in the abscence of adequate scientific evidence.

&gt;Literally every macro sized process we have ever come to understand has proven to involve discrete values and deterministic outputs. 

This is technically false but practically partially true. I'm not sure it's worth explaining to you how probabilities work though. I've ""lost interest"" in doing so.

Humanity, all life forms, and nature face unprecedented, interrelated and unsustainable global challenges: climate and ecological crises caused by Capitalism, rampant militarization, an escalating war danger with Iran and in the Middle East, including nuclear war, and a crisis of wealth extremes perpetuated by Western Capitalists.

We face a crisis of wealth extremes, growing racial and social inequality, the instability and unpredictability of a crisis-ridden and predatory Capitalist system, made more chaotic with the unbalanced and mentally ill Trump and his trade wars.

We face unpredictable economic and social disruption brought on by the new phase of the scientific, technological, communications revolution, including robotics and artificial intelligence.

We face a lawless, lying, racist, bigoted, mentally unstable, climate-denying occupant of the White House, who has brought on a democratic and constitutional crisis, and a global extreme right and wealth concentration that threatens democracy EVERYWHERE.

    Today’s multiple crises must be addressed globally and simultaneously.

These crises intersect, converge, and compound one another. They must be addressed globally and simultaneously, on a scope and scale that meets the challenges.

Together, the solutions, the transition to a green and demilitarized Socialist economy, and funding this transition through radical wealth redistribution and reallocation of military spending, are a basis for the unity of the overwhelming majority of people in our country international Socialist working-class solidarity, global political and economic cooperation.

These are radical solutions and will also require the greatest mobilization of people and resources our country and planet has ever known.

We have witnessed enormous changes in the past few decades. But they pale in comparison to the changes, challenges, and upheaval now bearing down on us.

For many, this is a moment of despair.  A moment of fear and insecurity. A moment of scapegoating and division.

But this is also a turning point moment. A time of growing unity, of democratic Socialism and transformative upsurge profoundly impacting politics and mass thinking.

Millions are turning to each other and rising to Socialist Revolution. We are marching, voting, and organizing to oust Crazy Trump and the extreme right-wing; determined to defend democratic rights and rescue our shared planet and future.

Millions are challenging the basic ideas and institutions of white supremacy, patriarchy, and the capitalist system.

Our multi-racial working-class in alliance with the African American, Latin, Asian American, Native American and other communities of color, women, youth, organized labor, environmental justice, and other social movements are finding hope in community, unity, and struggle!

We’re the ones, this broad democratic alliance, we’ve been waiting for! And we’re the ones who will lead the fight to expand Socialist democratic rights and save the planet. And we’re the ones who will bring into being a radically new kind of Socialist society free of exploitation, hate, and inequality.

While this idiotic US administration dismantles the Environmental Protection Agency and puts polluters in charge of regulating themselves, states and cities are declaring their commitment to the Paris Climate Accords, and the Green New Deal has bolted into the national discussion! 

Our nation and the world face enormous challenges, and people everywhere are rising to fight for Socialism and the ideas and solutions that it brings to every single human and animal on the planet !

The crises facing humanity are rooted in the predatory system of global Capitalism; the Capitalist mode of production and drive for maximum profits. They beg the question of what comes first: People and nature or corporate profits?

 “Capitalism cannot reform itself. It is doomed to self-destruction. No universal selfishness can bring social good to all.”
We are fighting for a new society of majority rule, economic and political democracy, full racial and gender equality, a society based on solidarity, Socialist solutions, community, and cooperation; a society without classes, prisons, walls, and borders.

Everyone except the climate deniers, knows the climate and ecological crises are driven by human activity. And not just any human activity, but that rooted in the Capitalist production process, the exploitation of labor and nature, and the drive for maximum profits. The crisis has accelerated because of the sheer scope, and scale, of the exploitation and destruction of nature by Capitalists.
The US path to socialism is one that embraces militant peaceful non-violence as a means, a creed, and an end.

The US path to socialism is a collaborative project of every force committed to full economic and political Socialist democracy, a project shaped in the here and now – the battle to defend and expand Socialist democracy and defeat the extreme-right, at the ballot box, in the streets, and in the battle of ideas.

The plan includes procurement of a range of weapons, missiles, air defence systems, fighter jets, submarines and warships, drones, surveillance equipment and developing infrastructure for extensive use of artificial intelligence, official sources said.

While India's spending has remained relatively constant in the last 10-15 years compared to its GDP, China's has significantly ramped up defence budget during the period.

""The government will spend USD 130 billion for fleet modernisation in the next 5-7 years across all armed forces,"" the official document stated.

The sources said the CDS will play a key role in implementing the modernisation drive in the three forces.

The sources said establishing India as a military power in the outer space will be another key aspect of the plan.

The government's immediate priority is to fast-track pending proposals including procuring 2,600 infantry combat vehicles, 1,700 future ready combat vehicles for the Indian Army and paving way for supplying 110 multirole fighter aircraft to the Indian Air Force, they said.

1650,[],occipixel_lobe,,,[],,,,text,t2_6zg3h,False,," You've bought into the parody of what Adam Smith said. I'd suggest reading the actual text, or reading into analyses of it, instead of parroting what you think sounds right.

Adam Smith says that human nature is not greedy:

&gt;“How  selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles  in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render  their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it,  except the pleasure of seeing it""

(*Theory of Moral Sentiments* Part I; Chapter I, Section I, pg. 4).

He says that all value is derived from labour:

&gt;""The  value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and  who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other  commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to  purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real measure of the  exchangeable value of all commodities.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The  real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who  wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it""

(*The Wealth of Nations* Book I; Chapter V, pg. 33).

He says that the natural wage of labour is it's product:

&gt;""The  produce of labour constitutes the natural recompence or wages of labour  In that original state of things which precedes both the appropriation  of land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce of labour  belongs to the labourer. He has neither landlord nor master to share  with him.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Had  this state continued, the wages of labour would have augmented with all  those improvements in its productive powers, to which the division of  labour gives occasion. All things would gradually have become cheaper""

(*The Wealth of Nations* Book I; Chapter VIII, pg. 73).

He argues that the general well-being of society is predicated on just compensation of labour:

&gt;""No  society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater  part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides,  that they who feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people,  should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be  themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged""

(*The Wealth of Nations* Book I; Chapter VIII, pg. 90).

He argues that profit has ""pernicious effects"":

&gt;""Our  merchants and master manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of  high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of their  goods, both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad  effects of high profits; they are silent with regard to the pernicious  effects of their own gains; they complain only of those of other people""

(*The Wealth of Nations* Book I; Chapter IX, pg. 113).

Rent is theft:

&gt;""The  landlord demands a rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed  interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an  addition to this original rent. Those improvements, besides, are not  always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the  tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord  commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all  made by his own.  
&gt;  
&gt;""He sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvements.  \[Begin here a long Jeremiad about kelp\]""

(*The Wealth of Nations* Book I; Chapter XI, pgs. 166-167).

The interests of the bourgeoisie are opposed to those of society:

&gt;""The  interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or  manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even  opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market, and to narrow the  competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market  may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to  narrow the competition must always be against it, and can only serve to  enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally  would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of  their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation of  commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to  with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having  been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but  with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men,  whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who  have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public,  and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and  oppressed it""

(*The Wealth of Nations* Book I; Chapter XI, Part III, pgs. 287-288).

Property is the source of inequality:

&gt;""Wherever  there is a great property, there is great inequality. For one very rich  man, there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the  few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich  excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want,  and prompted by envy to invade his possessions""

(*The Wealth of Nations* Book V; Chapter I, Part II, pg. 766).

The role of the state is to oppress the poor and protect the wealthy:

&gt;""Civil  government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property,  is, in reality, instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor,  or of those who have some property against those who have none at all""

(*The Wealth of Nations* Book V; Chapter I, Part II, pg. 771).

Against a flat tax:

&gt;""It  is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public  expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more  than in that proportion""

They are now spreading in the environment, GM Watch reported Wednesday.

The yellow fever mosquitos (Aedes aegypti) are genetically engineered to make it impossible for their offspring to survive. After release they were supposed to mate with female mosquitos of the species which transmit infectious diseases, such as Dengue fever, to diminish the natural populations.

However, the now published research shows that many offspring of the genetically engineered mosquitos actually survived and are spreading and propagating further. According to the scientists, between 10-60 percent of the mosquitoes in the region concerned are inheriting parts of the genome of the mosquitoes released in the trials. These findings are also confirmed in neighbouring regions where no such trials were conducted.

The long-term consequences for the transmission of diseases, the number of insects and the interactions with the environment cannot be predicted. The mosquitoes used for the genetic manipulation are originally from Cuba and Mexico. These insects used in the laboratory have now mixed with the Brazilian insects to become a robust population which can persist in the environment over a longer period of time. They might replace the original insects in the long term and even enhance the problems associated with the mosquitoes.

Christoph Then for Testbiotech commented, “The Oxitec trials have led to a situation that is largely out of control. The company has released its patented insects although it was known before that some insects could survive in the environment. The expectations of their investors were more important than the protection of health and the environment. There is no insurance and no fast-track mechanism to prevent severe damage in a worst-case scenario.

“This incident must have consequences for further applications of genetic engineering. Preventing the spread of genetically engineered organisms within natural populations has to become a priority.”

Oxitec misled the public

Oxitec misled the public and regulators regarding the GM mosquitoes, which it falsely described as “self-limiting”. It obtained funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to develop the GM insects.

The new paper also reminds us that Oxitec’s strategy to reduce the population of mosquitoes did not work. It cites previous research as showing that the effectiveness of the release program began to break down after about 18 months: the population which had been suppressed rebounded to nearly pre-release levels.

Several research institutions players are planning to create genetically engineered trees, bees, corals, several insect species and other organisms that can spread in natural populations. The long-term impacts of such trials are unpredictable. Unintended effects can disturb or disrupt ecosystems and lead to the extinction of species. Therefore Testbiotech is proposing to introduce new criteria for the risk assessment of genetically engineered organisms to make sure they can be prevented from spreading uncontrolled into the environment.“

* This is the target of TZM.  To hit critical mass in *awareness.*  You want people to bring up the resource based economy in *normal conversation* not just on the internet.  You want this to be a well known alternative.  It's not just capitalism vs communism.  There's also science, engineering, &amp; robotics as a choice as well.

* The world's militaries.
* America's military in specific could tackle building a test RBE on a smaller scale AND put in solar reflectors, desalinization, come up with phytoplankton genetic modifications to make them more tolerant to the acid in the ocean (to give us more time to fix this so the food chain doesn't collapse), and things of that nature.

The militaries already have a command structure in place, and they have a shit ton of resources.  Well, the US does.

And they need to be ordered to SAVE mankind and not fight with other countries.  12&amp;nbsp;000 years of permanent civilization.  It's time to move on from countries.

I may have to myself, depending on how things go in the next 5 years or so.

And then once this shit is under control, and the RBE is setup, they need to *release* that control, and let computers take over the resource control.  And instead, humanity needs to consider where do we want to go as a species ?  To the stars ?  To the movies ?

Relying on farming methods that are excluding improvements in an entire field of science is what is unsustainable. In the next 50 years, literal billions of people are going to enter the middle class in Asia and Africa. These people are going to want to eat more meat, a wider variety of vegetable crops, or offseason food crops like strawberries in summer. These demands can't all be satisfied with organic farming, which has drastically lower yields (up to 70% less in the most extreme crops) and doesn't inherently address issues with food waste either. In fact, there are modern methods of dealing with preserving food that are not available to organics, like certain chemical preservatives.

At the end of the day, organic farming is a subset of industrial agriculture.

1682,[],Pantarus,,,[],,,,text,t2_9bm8v,False,,"We actually agree on a lot of individual points and there's some that absolutely won't see eye to eye on.

1) I 100% agree that immigration is being used as a scapegoat for changing times, changing industries, and automation. Coal mining started losing miners as technology changed allowing fewer men to operate far more powerful equipment. The nail in the coffin is cleaner, cheaper, and easier to obtain energy. But it's a lot easier to blame an immigrant than to accept that you need to change, are in a dying industry, and may need to accept a whole new way of life. But I also support diverting subsidies to help train, relocate, and assist people whose entire county will be devastated by the loss of an entire industry. They contributed for generations to this country and worked hard in difficult jobs that most of us wouldn't last a day in. We should over a boost to the next wrung of the ladder.

2) Although I'm a leftie I own several firearms. I'm pro-gun control in a sort of sweeping way. I believe that all firearm sales, private or through an FFL need to go through a background check, I believe a mental health records check for specific codes should be part of it. I also believe that (even if you don't have a felony) if you're convicted of several lesser crimes, that should add up to ""You're not a responsible citizen"" and shouldn't be allowed a firearm. I don't believe guns cause mass shootings, I believe they are a tool that's being misused. There is an endemic problem in the US, where there are sick people that desperately want to hurt others. Maybe it's a mental health issue...I don't have a solution. In the short term, I'm willing to peacefully hand over my AR if it becomes illegal. I'm not willing to completely disavow my 2A right altogether however.

3) This is where we separate first. I believe that until a certain point a fetus is just a non-living grouping of individual cells. I'm not religious so I don't believe in souls or that a life is instantly a life at conception, I don't believe there is anything sacred about it. I don't believe late term abortions should be legal unless it's an extenuating circumstance or the mother's life is in danger. That line in the sand should be up to OB/GYN's and experts to decide. I'm not experienced enough or know enough about the exact biology to give an opinion on where that line should be.

3) Pro-Birth Control 100% give that shit out like candy. Teach it in high school. Control teen pregnancies as much as possible. The problem I have with conservatives is that they want to teach abstinence (which statistically doesn't work) and still don't want abortions. I respect your opinion here, you can be pro-life...but then you shouldn't hamstring education on sex-ed.

4) I'm quasi-free trade. I do take issue with corporations taking advantage of lower quality of living standards of third world countries to effectively pay next to zero for labor. To me that's almost slavery, which does two things 1) Destroys the need for any US labor, increasing the scapegoating of immigrants 2) Because they pay so very little real wages to the third world country...it does very little to increase those people's standard of living at all.

5) Pro-Freedom Dividend: I agree with a universal basic income on a bunch of levels. First, we are a first world country and we need to set a minimum standard of living for our citizens. But that minimum, in my opinion, should be markedly below the living standard of someone working minimum wage. Which, minimum wage should be a living wage. Not 60 grand or anything, but you should be able to afford better than welfare standards if you are indeed working and trying to make it in this world. 

If you want to take that universal income and live on that, fine. But it won't be a high standard of living. I'd imagine anyone with any get-up-and-go won't be satisfied there and anyone without it, wouldn't have gotten past welfare life anyway. 

6) I'm for a wealth tax. Historically in the US, (lets call them the good ole days people keep trying to bring us back to) the wealthy were taxed much higher. You seem to have an Anne Rand view of billionaires, but even in her time there wasn't such a pooling of resources at the top. I don't think we should take everything everyone earns, but there comes a point where having that much money hoarded CAN affect innovation coming up from the bottom. The problem with capitalism is that it's basically a room full of spiders....at the end of the day...there's only going to be one left. 

Everyone should pay what they can pay. Ask not what your country can do for you type stuff. Once you reach a BILLION dollars...what are you spending that on? That isn't corporate wealth we are talking about, it's about individuals who have more money than some states. They'll still be filthy completely rich, to the point that their great-great-great-great grand-kids won't have to work or COULD even spend all that money while burning a 100,000.00 a day. That money could change the world.

7) Healthcare is interesting to me. For a selfish reason. I have kids. Eventually it has to happen. AS we progress as a society health care will become a human right. If I die tomorrow or my company decides to sell, or implode due to some CEO scandal, I shouldn't have to worry about my kids health. Nor should you. Nor should anyone. 

8) The student loan relief is one of those things that goes hand in hand with immigration. So in most developed countries, after passing a series of tests, their children get an education for free. Then they immigrate here and are now in competition for jobs with our students who are loaded down to the gills with debt. That's automatically putting our students at a massive disadvantage. Who knows what inventions are not being made or businesses not being started because someone said ""I can't afford this...why bother.""

I think if we free up education and make it a meritocracy we will be directly sponsoring our futures. BUT it has to be in areas that we need it. You want to go into fine arts? GREAT there are 20 spots open for the tops artists in the state. Go get em. After that, I believe you should be allowed to pay for it if you want it. Why should I stop you from learning what you wanna learn. But as a society we should be subsidizing engineers, scientists, etc.

I don't have all the answers by any means. Funny to see that there's tons of stuff we agree on, but it's these different nuances that separate us at the voting booth.

Widespread famines will lead to political instability in countries that are already unstable, particularly those around the equator which will have the worse impacts of climate change.

So, I'm not talking about the system of capitalism in this context. I am only speaking of the tax system, in the way that it can be used to redistribute wealth throughout society through subsidies, things like Universal Health Care, Universal Basic Income, a reverse tax credit for those in poverty, etc. This is the way that taxes SHOULD work, which was my point

&gt;The solution is to abolish private property.

This will never happen. The fact is that when you attempt to abolish private property you run into two possible solutions: you let the people determine how this is run, or you punt that responsibility to the government.

Giving this responsibility to either runs up against the reason that capitalism in it's raw form doesn't work either: humans are very greedy no matter what.

If we give this responsibility to the means of production to the government in some sort of planned economy, someone in the government will eventually warp the system to benefit themselves. This has been deemed true time and time again.

If we give this responsibility to the people, to distribute the means of production among themselves, then two problems become apparent:

1. Again, someone will get greedy, manipulate their fellow people into giving them power and control, and the system breaks down
2. The system you would need seems very fantastical. I know this is going to be pointed out as Nirvana fallacy, but what would the system of everyone owning their workplace look like? What if someone wanted to own a factory on their own, so they offered people money to work there? would you have to have shares in a company to work there? How would these be structured? It becomes very complicated very fast.

Given these ideas, I'd love to hear more of what you have to say. I know this post comes off as combative, but it makes me a little bit sad to see that when we are faced with huge problems like we see above, we don't look to fix the system, but rather to tear it down and start anew. I am a proponent for regulated capitalism with some elements that some would see as socialist: you put in place programs that make sure nobody starves, everyone has a place to live and a hospital they can go to without going bankrupt. From there, you then have a huge group of people that - instead of spending every day just trying to live, they can go forth and help solve big problems, explore their passions, etc. I don't think **socialism** can work in the world we live in. But expanding and exploring policy that expands **social programs** can use the system we have to achieve the ideals that we strive for. 

On the topic of climate change, which was the original topic, once you have a large group of people who think they have a bright future, they will fight for it. We can enact tax policy that shuts down oil and coal business without destroying any economies, we can put subsidies into clean energy, we can put in certain committees and groups that will focus on cleaning up the environment in big cities, etc.

On the topic of making sure nobody gets stupidly, absurdly rich, we make progressive taxes a lot more aggressive, to make sure that instead of just stopping productivity, we use that and channel it to help those in the lower classes, to raise them up to a standard of living that lets them live with dignity.

No problem.  I'm someone who naturally gravitates towards problem solving.  Tech support, QA, etc.  So I tend to look at things differently than alot of other folks.  They are busy getting swept up in emotions and I'm busy analyzing and trying to poke holes in everyone's arguments including my own.  

I understand the emotional reality of the world, but I'm not fond of platitudes.  Surface level feelings and data analysis lead to surface level results.  You have to be willing to dive into something deeper than is necessarily comfortable if you ever hope to understand it well enough to fix it.

&amp;nbsp;

After all, if the fixes were as easy as most people express we would have fixed it decades ago.  Life is complicated and messy and always we operate on incomplete information.  What feels good and what is good often wildly diverges, much like chocolate is fricken tasty and having a full belly is a beautifully fantastic feeling.  But if I eat poorly and overeat regularly I'm going to have serious health problems.  Most societal stuff I see in the same way.  There is always friction between short term feel good solutions and long term focus on fixing the problem solutions.  

&amp;nbsp;

AA is ironically a bit of a middle ground on that.  Short term it plugs square pegs into round holes to give an immediate sense of ""we're doing something"" with the idea that long term things will change.  As I said before, it was worth a shot..but if it's not making a significant impact by now then we need to refocus.  I feel kind of the same way about Universal Basic Income actually.  UBI could potentially have alot of unpredictable effects, but it's prolly worth a shot.

1701,[],A_Soporific,,,[],,,,text,t2_8z55c,False,,"I would argue that taxing corporations is stupid and pointless. Corporations don't pay taxes even when they do simply because they are legal fictions that are stand-ins for a variety of groups of people. So, when the corporation pays taxes who is really paying? Is it the consumers in the form of higher prices? After all, they drive the whole thing corporations can't sell if no one buys and all the money in mature corporations ultimately starts there. Is it the employees in the form lower wages, deferred or dropped bonuses, crappier and fewer benefits, or the simple expedient of declining to fill vacant positions? After all, they are the vast majority of corporation and the largest expenses of the corporation. What about the shareholders? They benefit in the form of profit, after all.

If you tax the corporation you give control over who is actually out stuff to the corporation. They shift as much of the cost on the average person (ie consumer) as possible because that hurts them least. What they can't stick to the consumer they try to ""make up"" cut cutting back other expenses (ie employees). Finally, after all other options have been exhausted, does the bottom line take the hit. Of course, nowadays the majority of shareholders are institutional so you're taxing the retirement investments of workers as much as the wealthy. Raising corporate taxes would simply obfuscate how much the wealthy have shifted responsibilities to the poorer classes since when you say ""corporate tax"" people hear ""tax on rich people"" but in truth it's ""tax on everyone with an emphasis on workers"".

I would argue that doing away with the corporate tax *AND* the capital gains tax and roll that into the Income Tax would be a good stopgap under the existing system. At least that way you're pairing profit and taxes again so the people who benefit are the people paying.

I hate the idea of taking control of healthcare away from doctors and patients. Anyone removed is only seeing numbers and doesn't have a full understanding of the real situation. The distance and the illegibility to patients guarantee inferior care. The only problem is that this has already happened with insurance companies. I don't see a very big difference between that downside of a single payer insurance and the current slew of insurance schemes. While I would strongly prefer an alternative I lack the understanding of system to properly articulate an effective alternative. So, I guess but I'm going to complain about it.

I don't think that a Universal Basic Income is necessary or the unquestioned good that people seem to think it is. The payment will never be remotely close to a ""living wage"" because that money has to come from somewhere or it will destroy the currency. Moreover, it won't replace all social programs because there will be plenty of people who have problems that can't be fixed with a small, regular infusion of cash. I can readily see a UBI replace a lot of welfare such as social security, housing assistance, food stamps, and similar. I can really see how removing the pointless moralizing nonsense like ""here's money that you can only use on one thing, even if you can cover that one thing some other way it's criminal to use this money on your real problems"" or drug testing beneficiaries. At the same time, it's going to fall way short of the hype because it won't solve the problem of drug addicts, the mentally ill, or systemically underemployed. Besides, a Negative Income Tax where you take something similar to the current income tax but flip it negative somewhere between 1/2 and 2/3 the median wage. That way the people on the bottom can get a much larger payment than a UBI would allow, the people in the middle see little to no change, and the wealthy pay into it making the budget way easier to balance.

I'm all on board for a carbon tax, but would prefer a carbon price. Where the government collects per ton of carbon emitted but pays out for each ton sequestered. Which would create an industry around planting forest or using industrial carbon capture technology that's been used off and on since the 1970's to balance out or flip emissions negative to possibly undo some of the damage already done rather than simply aiming to mitigate the damage we continue to do.

Most of the housing policy can be fixed by abandoning single use zoning and loosening a variety of zoning restrictions. Really encouraging people who don't mind to move into smaller cities can take a lot of the pressure off the largest cities. Trying to artificially force a particular housing pattern tends to end up breaking cities, which fare best when the residents of the city have the political power and access to capital to develop the space around themselves rather than have orders come down from on high.

How about we go back in time before money. People did things then. I'm not suggesting we have a hunger gatherer economy. It just proves that your premise is wrong. Ie when you said without money people won't do anything. 

I can imagine dozens of systems without money where people still do things. 

China for example is going to use social credit scores to motivate people. And do away with money. That's part of their plan for their communist future past the next 50 years. To phase out capitalism. 

I'd say star trek works on social credit. 

However here is a very real one that we will have to start dealing with in the next 10 years. Full automation. Means every job will be done by robots. No jobs for people. None. Propose an economic system that can handle this situation? 

Maybe universal basic income? Where each citizen gets a ration of money or production units they can spend on production? 

But if production is all done by robots and is infinitely scalable by use of more robots why should any individual be limited by however many production units the government allows him to have? 

(and this is ignoring the probable issue of the owners of scalable automation simply hoarding the means of production and killing all the excess workers) 

Post scarcity eventually means a citizen can produce any object almost immediately at no cost. What would money mean in such a situation? 

And noone would need to be motivated to do the shit jobs. Those shit jobs wouldn't exist. As they would be automated. So money and fake scarcity wouldn't be needed to force people to clean dirty drains for survival. 

People would be able to live in any manner they chose at no cost. Robots would retrieve the natural resources they needed for their personal scalable automated factories to produce any good imaginable on demand. And ai would dream up new goods and ways of using them.

No one is going to ""suddenly"" change their ways, but a big factor of that is that change takes time.

Consider, 30 years ago the only people that talked about global warming were scientists. 20 years ago global was something mentioned occasionally as a ""future us"" problem, with occasional token efforts to do something. 10 years ago global warming was an imminent problem that saw active investment. Now global warming is something that affects people directly, and only the real nutjobs still actually think it's fake.

Yes, there are still businesses that are trying to wring every last penny from the environment, but more and more of those are struggling to keep up with new technology.

I'll try to dig them up. I'm in the midst of trying to get better organized, so maybe now's the time to better organize all my random bookmarks lol

&gt;One other thing I’m not sure I understand is the extent to which machines are capable of developing theses or underlying fundamental understandings that humans have yet to develop or even ponder.

Its weird, and even as a programmer who's kinda watched the tech emerge and kind of understand... I still really don't. But IMO the scariest part of the modern age is that even as someone who doesn't understand, you can still get incredibly powerful models out of the open source tech that exists. 

The TL;DR is that different problems can be categorized by the type of problem they're aiming to solve. Maybe its a classification problem where you want to group things around known labels, or a clustering problem where you want to group things based on key indicators but don't yet know what the labels are. Or maybe its some kind of regression modelling that tries to look at past results and plot some kind of linear curve that describes them which could then be used to project future results given whatever variables. While each model could likely individually be generated by humans, machine learning rapidly increases the rate at which you can develop those models, and expands the reach of the technology. Think how much more accessible product development is with 3D printers, vs the oldschool way where you have to research &amp; find manufacturers and pay out the nose for each iteration... except the feedback loops are faster and ultimately more far reaching. 

&gt;To date, I’ve heard of machine learning and AI that produce astounding results within the general parameters and assumed conclusions given to them by human beings, but nothing truly and/or independently “out of the box,” so to speak.

I think this depends on what your definition of out of the box entails. Personally, I'm still amazed constantly by what technology can do now that it couldn't 10 years ago. Models being overfitted is definitely a big concern, but its gotten better, and is ultimately at the control of the team developing the models so its not really a computer limitation. 90+% of the work now with ML development is in compiling, cleaning and preparing the data for training. If you want to see a truly mind boggling piece of tech that will open your synapses, check out [Amazone Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). Amazon had all their AWS tech already which included various sets of ML tooling, and realizes most of the work was in the preparing, categorizing and cleaning of data stage, so they released SageMaker which uses ML to prepare your data for training your ML... I shit you not. All of this future tech sounding stuff is now becoming so turnkey its almost approaching being LEGO. 

&gt;Are you saying we’re right on the cusp of those “outside the box” sort of insights? I assume you are. And if so, how exactly does that translate to AI figuring out how to interface with our biological makeup, namely our brain matter and nervous system in general?

Yes. Not necessarily just because of quantum computers, but just in general 100x yes. Technology is an exponential curve, and we're living through the heel of it where we're just now starting to realize how fast things have changed over the past 100-200 years. The next 100 years will be truly insane, and the next 10 years will be transformative, while the next 3 (Canada's election, the US election, and Germany's election in 2021) will be critical IMO. 

Re: how ML helps with BCI, modern neuroscience is being propelled by machine learning enabling it to make sense of the uncountable number of circuits in the brain. The older school brain breakdown of all the gyruses is increasingly dated while we've managed to map specific circuits in higher res, and some teams have applied machine learning to the data resulting from increasingly high res scans of the brain. The entire field is admittedly incredibly crude compared to most other modern sciences. The best description I've heard is that our understanding of the brain is at around our understanding of medicine when we still practiced medicinal cannibalism lol. But the missing ingredient is ultimately computational engines capable of computing faster than our meat computers, which despite being remarkably stupid, are also orders of magnitude more efficient computers per energy cost than any device you've ever touched, and given our exponential tech curve and ML in general being at the precipice of controlling everything, IMO neuroscience is going to see staggering developments over the next 20-30 years that will easily enable an implant driven cyber borg.",1569128370,{},f11okki,False,t3_d7ego2,False,True,t1_f11jx2n,/r/worldnews/comments/d7ego2/microsoft_chief_brad_smith_says_rise_of_killer/f11okki/,1569130813.0,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A COMPUTATIONAL TASK TO
DEMONSTRATE QUANTUM SUPREMACY
To demonstrate quantum supremacy, we compare our
quantum processor against state-of-the-art classical com-
puters in the task of sampling the output of a pseudo-
random quantum circuit[24{26]. Random circuits are a
suitable choice for benchmarking since they do not pos-
sess structure and therefore allow for limited guarantees
of computational hardness[24, 25, 27, 28]. We design the
circuits to entangle a set of quantum bits (qubits) by re-
peated application of single-qubit and two-qubit logical
operations. Sampling the quantum circuit’s output pro-
duces a set of bitstrings, e.g. f0000101, 1011100, ...g.
Due to quantum interference, the probability distribution
of the bitstrings resembles a speckled intensity pattern
produced by light interference in laser scatter, such that
some bitstrings are much more likely to occur than oth-
ers. Classically computing this probability distribution
becomes exponentially more dicult as the number of
qubits (width) and number of gate cycles (depth) grows.
We verify that the quantum processor is working prop-
erly using a method called cross-entropy benchmarking
(XEB) [24, 26], which compares how often each bitstring
is observed experimentally with its corresponding ideal
probability computed via simulation on a classical com-
puter. For a given circuit, we collect the measured bit-
strings fx
igand compute the linear XEB delity [24{
26, 29], which is the mean of the simulated probabilities
of the bitstrings we measured:
F
XEB = 2
nhP(x
i)i
i 1 (1)
where nis the number of qubits, P(x
i) is the probability
of bitstring x
i computed for the ideal quantum circuit,
and the average is over the observed bitstrings. Intu-
itively, F
XEB is correlated with how often we sample high
probability bitstrings. When there are no errors in the
quantum circuit, sampling the probability distribution
will produce F
XEB = 1. On the other hand, sampling
from the uniform distribution will give hP(x
i)i
i = 1=2n
and produce F
XEB = 0. Values of F

1 correspond to the probability that no error has oc-
curred while running the circuit. The probabilities P(x
i)
must be obtained from classically simulating the quan-
tum circuit, and thus computing F
XEB is intractable in
the regime of quantum supremacy. However, with certain
circuit simplications, we can obtain quantitative delity
estimates of a fully operating processor running wide and
deep quantum circuits.
Our goal is to achieve a high enough F
XEB for a circuit
with sucient width and depth such that the classical
computing cost is prohibitively large. This is a dicult
task because our logic gates are imperfect and the quan-
tum states we intend to create are sensitive to errors. A
single bit or phase
ip over the course of the algorithm
will completely shue the speckle pattern and result in
close to 0 delity [24, 29]. Therefore, in order to claim
quantum supremacy we need a quantum processor that
executes the program with sufficiently low error rates.",1569089785,{},f0z9iee,False,t3_d77f6k,False,True,t1_f0xz5tr,/r/worldnews/comments/d77f6k/googles_processor_makes_threeminute_calculation/f0z9iee/,1569089786.0,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1722,[],EightEqualsEqualsDe,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzg5t,False,,"Alright check this out. Normal (classical computers) got these things called bits. Their a bit, because they're a bit of information. What is a bit? A bit can be thought of as a tiny little electric thingy, if it has enough electric shit (or rather, voltage) then it can complete some arbitrary circuit. Let's call this 1. If it's low voltage, we can call it zero. The bit of information, is if it's a 1 or a 0.

Now, 0s and 1s aren't that interesting, but what you do with them is. There are tiny circuits built with logic gates. A logic gates takes some number of bits as inputs, and spits out some other bit or bits as output . It takes a lot of logic gates to hardware a circuit to perform some function, but doing something like making a calculator can be done in a day.

In the case of a calculator, I have two bits as input, and two bits as output. (This is important later for understanding key properties of QC)
If my two bits are 0,0. My output is 0+0 = 0 with a carry out of 0. If I add 1 + 1, I don't get 2, there is no 2 in binary. I get 1 with a carry out of 1.

2 bits as input, 2 bits as output. You now have a basic adder. You can make more complex computer stuff now.

That's the basic of how a classical computer works. You got tiny bits of information, and circuits which give the basics of input and output. 

A quantum computer (QC) has qubits, instead of bits. They are quantum binary digits. This part I'm just going to have to lay down as fact. I can write more on the physical fundamentals later. But, you know how some people like to get philosophical, all like ""is reality deterministic and everything I'll ever do can be calculated or do I have free will?"" Well, on the Quantum level, reality is not deterministic, but probabilistic. True, genuine, unpredictable, randomness is at the core of nature. But what is this randomness centered around, what is random?

So, in classical computers my bit of information is how much potential (voltage) I have. You can think of it as a tiny device measuring energy, and Making a cutoff decision. There's enough energy so this bit is 0 or 1.

In basic quantum mechanics(QM), these are the four things you can measure: Position, Time, (when and where something is), Energy, and Speed (technically momentum). 

So in QM, things are probablistic. The things I measure, have probabilities. It's not a definite location I measure, but I construct an equation describing the probability distribution, and can tell you what the average position will be if I run the experiment a fuck ton of times. However, individual runs may still be very, very far from the theoretical average. Here's the fucky part though, that thing your measuring, that bit or electron or any really really tiny enough thing to make it a quanta of something, exists in every single unique probability until you measure it. It's weird, like nature's playing peek-a-boo with reality. But until you measure that thing , it's in all the states of whatever it could be after you measure it - before you measure it. After you measure it, it picks one of those states, according to your distribution.

Why is this important for QC? Okay, so our bits of information are probablistic in nature. There's some special logic gates for QC, one such is a haddamard gate (further reading on your own). If I don't force a measurement, I can keep playing with these quantum states, changing their probability distributions, and when I'm all done I can ""measure"" my qbit as input to some basic circuit to do basic math or whatever. A qbit can do the same shit a bit does, but that's sorta wasteful. Let a qbit do quantum probability stuff.

Here's the kicker though. Remember the basic adder from above? Two bits as input, two bits as output. 4 unique entries (0+0, 0+1, 1+0, 1+1). If I have more bits as input and output, I can do more addition.

In QC,my bits are probabilistic. Not only that, but until I measure it, it's in a probablistic combination of all possible states. There's a 100% chance it's in 1 state out of all states.  Let's say I have 1 qbits as input, written as

.25*|0&gt; + .75|1&gt;

That means I have a 25 percent chance being a 0, the rest 1. Maybe I can add that bit with itself. Then there are four states the output could be.

|00&gt;

|01&gt;

|10&gt;

|11&gt;

And let's say the all have 25% probability, for now, just for ease of writing I'm on mobile. 
Each of those output bits, have an associated probability. But it only takes 2 bits encode all 4 of those possibilities. If I wanted to add those two together, I would need 3 bits to encode all 8 probabilities. But I only ever have to do the math on 1 bit, to get the results from adding 4 unique combinations. Or do the math on 2 bits to get the results from adding all 8 combinations. it's exponential growth, adding just 1 tiny qbit is like adding the effect of ALL THE QBITS before it. Everytime you add 1qbit, that's the effect you're feeling.

Now, no one wants to be 78% certain on what 2+2 is, QC is not meant for these types of tasks. What they're excellent at is computing probabilities, simulating certain systems, and my favorite: function inversion. Check out the Wikipedia page on grovers algorithm, it's pretty cool. Basically, you can think of it as a huge speed up in finding a needle in a haystack, or searching for anything inside an ordered list of things. Like finding a number inside a database.

Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized systems based on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of a cryptocurrency, and arguably its biggest allure, is its organic nature; **it is not issued by any central authority**, rendering it theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

&gt;
&gt;[The Chinese Surveillance State Part 1](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/podcasts/the-daily/china-surveillance-uighurs.html)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Using facial recognition software for ethnic profiling is only one way that Beijing is harnessing technology for social control.
&gt;
&gt;[The Chinese Surveillance State Part 2](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/podcasts/the-daily/china-uighurs-internment-camps-surveillance.html)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;We hear from a Uighur American who is fighting to free his relatives from one of China’s mass internment camps.
&gt;
&gt;[Is China Really Freeing Uighurs?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/podcasts/the-daily/china-xinjiang-uighur-detention.html)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Beijing continues to mislead the world on its mass internment of one of the country’s ethnic minorities, Uighur Muslims.
&gt;
&gt;----
&gt;
&gt;Here are some of the highlights:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; And they’ve hung lots of cameras in mosques. So the Id Kah Mosque is this beautiful, mustard yellow mosque that sits in the center of old Kashgar. It’s the heart of Uighur Islam. And I think I counted more than 200 cameras inside the mosque, trying to capture worshippers who would come and go. And there aren’t many worshippers anymore, of course, because who’s going to go walk in front of those cameras and show their faces? And then that very easily can just go into a database, and then they have a data point.
&gt;
&gt;----
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It’s hard to see how they achieve that goal in any kind of short or medium-term. I mean, I think we know pretty obviously that if you pull people into camps and berate them about their culture and shove propaganda down their throats and have them write criticisms of themselves, they’re going to sort of retreat to an even deeper set of convictions about who they are and what they stand for. But, at the same time, if you cannot read a Quran, you can’t grow out a beard, you can’t go to a mosque — if you can’t be yourself in your own homeland, then does it matter? Haven’t they already won anyway even if, inside, people do kind of still carry their Uighur identity with them? And, if you do that long enough, maybe you have two generations that are angry at you, but if you can keep it up long enough, then maybe people just forget. Then maybe it stops existing.
&gt;
&gt;----
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So from what our reporting shows, most are still in the camps. The camps are still very much a fixture of the way in which the Chinese government controls Xinjiang. And they seem like they’re there to stay. They’re built to last. They are large. They’ve built some different factories and different labor parks near camps. And they’re kind of forcing people to work there while they’re going to these camps. In no sense does it seem like this is the end of this program. It seems, in fact, like it’s just the beginning, and they remain a key part of China’s policy in the region.

Funny enough, when developing algorithms in Reinforcement Learning it was established that the best process for teaching systems was using a positive and negative reward system. If you only use positive rewards, your system will never head towards optimal paths.

How I heard this:

A friend of mine completed a doctorate in computer science with a research area of digital forensics.  He was developing algorithms to detect known (child pornographic) images that had been digitally manipulated in order to fool law enforcement hashing algorithms.  

*(Quick aside: Hashing algorithms are software libraries that allow forensic examiners (and law enforcement) to quickly search a hard drive to locate copies of known files.  This approach is often used to automate the discovery of child porn on a suspect's computer.  The challenge with hashing algorithms is that they can be easily fooled: changing a single pixel in a picture will cause the process to fail and the automated detection tools will not register a hit.  My colleague was working on a way to defeat this scheme and discover known pornographic images even when the hash values did not match.  This research was before the rise of deep learning and AI-based image recognition.)*

Fortunately for him, he could use pictures of anything during his research -- he did not spend 3 years staring at kiddie porn.

In any case, as part of his research, he had to do *a lot* of research into the mentality and habits of people who traffic child pornography.  The psychology of those folks was interesting, if disturbing.  One of the thing he reported was, per his research, there really were not that many ""sets"" of kiddie porn -- dozens/hundreds, not thousands.

The false positive argument you are mentioning can easily be taken down by just doing multiple tests. There is a video by a Youtuber Veritasium where he talks exactly about that.

And as for your first argument, it's assuming that there is no threshold after which an average human will feel safe enough to just go about their day happily without worrying much, which I believe is incorrect (in fact a lot of people are already in that stage). Just because we always strive for better it doesn't mean that we are always equally unsatisfied.

As early as 1948, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were impressed with Israel's military prowess and considered it a potential base for US power in the ME region.  Ten years later the CIA recognized that support for Israel is a ""logical corollary"" of US opposition to Arab secular nationalism (what is called ""radical nationalism"").  In 1967, Israel confirmed these long-held expectations by providing a huge gift to the US and Saudi Arabia by destroying the base of secular Arab nationalism (defeating Egypt, Syria and Jordan in less than a week).  Since then its services to the US have only increased, not only in the Mideast but worldwide. She has proved a useful intermediary when the US needs to export arms to unsavory countries. (Chomsky wrote me this in an email exchange I had with him on the topic)

Before 67, Israel was not an ally of the US. After 67, she proved her worth as a reliable pro american country in the region who knew how to fight. Israel's growing defense industry (I think they were #7 or #8 arms exporter in the world for the previous year) provides another reason as well as ample opportunity for American defense firms to have fruitful cooperation.

Yes, there are domestic factors like AIPAC, CUFI, Evangelicals, American Jewish support, but the alliance would exist regardless without it, it just wouldnt be as ""special"" as it is right now.  The US supports many countries that the American public is not fond of. It just becomes a bit harder to do it when the public doesn't like them. Historically, the Democrats were the social base of support for Israel, while the Republicans were skeptical of her. Today it's reversed. I think the Democratic unease with Israel comes from the dominance of right wing governments committed to expanding settlements and taking more land in the West Bank, which they see as a human rights problem. Obama was very open about this. I suspect the next Democratic president will have just as if not more of an uneasy relationship if current settlement policy continues.

------

To add to what you said -- I think you've summed up some of the geopolitical benefit during the cold war period, but people often miss the major benefits of the Israeli alliance today.

Israel is the region's predominant military, technological, intelligence and scientific power.

(Note that Israel was the regional power well before it received any American aid.)

To be more specific the main benefits as I see them are as follows:

1. Nuclear non-proliferation. A strong Israel keeps a lid on nuclear proliferation in its region (probably the region for which it is most critical to prevent proliferation). It was Israel that took out the Osiraq nuclear reactor in '81, preventing Saddam Hussein from acquiring nuclear weapons. They are the reason Iraq *did not* have nuclear weapons by the time of the US invasion. It was Israel that stopped the Syrian nuclear program in its tracks in 2007 with another targeted strike. Could you image what the Syrian Civil War would have looked like if Assad had not merely chemical but also nuclear weapons at his disposal?

2. Intelligence. Israeli intelligence agencies are second to none. In the last few years they have alerted western partners to attacks by the Islamic State [on airlines in Australia](https://www.israelhayom.com/2018/02/22/netanyahu-israeli-intelligence-helped-australia-stop-airliner-attack/), [attempted assassinations and a bombing in Europe ordered by the Iranian government](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5385164,00.html), [a different ISIS plot to plant explosives in computers to pass through US airport security](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4963347,00.html) (you may remember Trump then unceremoniously burning the Israeli agent inside ISIS to the Russians), [various intelligence coups](https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/02/11/report-mossad-helped-smuggle-nuclear-spy-out-of-iran/) [related to the Iranian nuclear program](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/15/us/politics/iran-israel-mossad-nuclear.html) and that's just what comes to mind at the moment and was released publicly. This has been going on for decades. Israeli intelligence warned the US about the September 11th attacks a month beforehand. [In the cold war era there was a long history of Israeli agents passing the US everything from Soviet missile technology to the speeches in the Kremlin to a fully working MiG](https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/israel-intelligence-cold-war/). And then there are the joint ops like Stuxnet, which leads nicely into my next reason.

3. Technology. Israel is Silicon Valley the country. It has the most startups per capita, the most engineers per capita and the most venture capital funding per capita of any country in the world. It is one of the world's leading countries in just about every technological area of vital interest to the US -- from drones to missile defense to cyber to artificial intelligence. Israeli and American technology is deeply entwined as well. There is no major American technology company I can think of that has not bought Israeli companies and doesn't have an R&amp;D center in Israel (including Apple, Facebook, Google, etc...) Most of Intel's new processors in the last fifteen years were designed in Haifa. Israelis invented the firewall, the flash drive and the Iron Dome. The US military is rife with Israeli technology as well. The hi-tech helmet displays of the F-35, the system that protects tanks from RPGs and a dozen other items were pioneered by the Israelis and passed on to American soldiers. And it's not just access to the technology, the US also gets the ability to restrict who Israel sells its technology to. Did you know that Israel is the world's #1 seller of military drones. They're considered the best in the market. But they don't sell to China. Or Russia. Even though doing so would earn them a tremendous amount of money and they have no natural clash of interests with those nations. They don't sell to them because the US asks them not to. It might surprise you to know that the Israeli parliament has actually debated ending the American aid because they were confident they could earn more in increased defense sales than they receive. (Ultimately they concluded that the close ties to the US were considerably more important than what could be expressed in dollars and cents and dismissed the discussion.) Israel's engineering and scientific prowess often gets overshadowed by other news coming out of the region, but their technological rise is astounding. They also, I believe, have won the most nobel prizes per capita of any country in the 21st century.

4. Shared values. The US supports vulnerable democracies. It stands by Taiwan, by South Korea and it stands by Israel. Israel is a rare bright spot for things like democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, gay rights, women's rights in its region. You can certainly argue the merit of supporting democratic values, but for many Americans that is a factor in their support of Israel and helping to defend these values is seen as a worthy cause (and a boon for American soft power). And unlike the other American allies in the region, it is not just Israel's government but their population as well that feels a strong bond with and kinship towards the US. A change in government in a country like Jordan or Egypt or Saudi Arabia is likely to result in that relationship souring. That's not true in Israel.

5. Israel protects itself. There is a great deal of discussion on the aid the US supplies to Israel. But the US spends more than double that on the security of countries like Japan, South Korea and Germany, countries far wealthier and in far less danger than Israel. The difference? The US has to protect those countries with American lives. Israel is the only major American ally for whom American lives have not had to be risked in her defense. They won all of their existential wars fighting alone, generally considerably outmanned. This is impossibly rare in the world today.

As I've outlined, there are some rather strong geopolitical benefits to supporting Israel as an ally. And by comparison, I see none in supporting the Palestinians (or Assad in the case of the Golan Heights). Once you might have argued that it would have won you the support of the Arab world. I don't think that was true then but it certainly isn't true now, given that half the Arab states have warming ties and under the table alliances with Israel.",1569167141,{},f13yfjv,False,t3_d7r1jo,False,True,t1_f13xu08,/r/news/comments/d7r1jo/zarif_saudi_and_uae_want_to_fight_iran_to_the/f13yfjv/,1569168160.0,1,True,[],False,news,t5_2qh3l,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1829,[],sillycyco,,,[],,,,text,t2_8eg37,False,,"&gt; Are you saying that the military has technology that can actually trick experienced pilots into thinking they're seeing not only something completely different, but very specifically weird stuff?

Not exactly. What was seen on radar and FLIR is what was tracked. What was visually seen could have been the actual objects, or countermeasures such as decoys, or even active interference using advanced methods we are unaware of. We do know they spend vast sums of money on developing materials and methods to confuse visual identification of objects.

What pilots cannot do is assess the same performance properties that sensors can, especially while moving at high speeds. Distance, angle, apparent size, all have an effect on what the pilot judges to be happening. If it is an unfamiliar object, you may attempt to judge from known characteristics and sizes of things you are familiar with, such as other human piloted aircraft. Keep in mind that ""visual sighting"" in a fighter aircraft is very, *very* augmented by on board systems. They aren't gazing out of an unobstructed window. They are viewing an augmented reality version of events with heads up displays, readouts of all sorts of data, etc. I doubt they took off their several million dollar helmets and opened the canopy to get a better look.

The visual encounter lasted only a short while and was from a fast moving fighter jet. All of the performance data we have is from the sensors, radar and infrared. These can be manipulated.

Maybe these weren't aircraft, but extreme performance missile defense technology, such as some form of [Multiple Kill Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Kill_Vehicle) of which we only know small [bits and pieces.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/raytheon-takes-next-step-toward-defining-multi-object-kill-vehicle-concept-300182522.html)

Nothing says these have to be airplanes with people inside. It could have been a test of a submarines countermeasures in the face of some advanced targeting ability the Russians have developed, or who knows what. 100's and 100's of billions of dollars are being spent *every year* in military research and technology. Sending some fighter pilots over to check it out and see what they visually and what their sensors pick up would be a nice part of that test.

Online shopping was still 15 years off, instead you went to a mall. Applications for jobs were all hard copy, face to face interview type things, and food deserts didn't (really) exist. You paid by cash or check, *maybe* by a debit card - they weren't too popular by that time.

That afternoon they'll drive past a mall that's empty to get to a strip mall with a clothing store in it, and his significant other will pay with a debit card for clothes that cost three times as much (on average) as when he went in.

But then he'll try to find a payphone to call a cab and there won't be any around. He'll walk into a bar (which probably looks exactly the same as when he left, only now it's got shots of wheatgrass) and the bartender will offer to call him an uber - and since he likely knows a little German it's going to confuse him. So he'll walk home, which he's more than capable of and not a lot of other people will be walking that way so that's good. And he's actually less likely to be harassed on the way.

&gt;Dear wireless consumers, 
While Sprint is working hard to deliver mobile 5G and the first 5G smartphone in the U.S., AT&amp;T is hard at work trying to convince you that they already won the race to 5G with something they call “5G Evolution.” That is simply untrue.

Don’t be fooled. 5G Evolution isn’t new or true 5G. It is fake 5G.
They would love for you to believe they are different … better. The truth is AT&amp;T is simply offering customers a nationwide 4G LTE network just like Sprint and all the other major wireless carriers.
It’s not 5G.
AT&amp;T’s fake 5G claims are deceiving consumers, but Sprint is fighting for you. We filed a lawsuit against AT&amp;T demanding that they immediately end their false and deceptive marketing campaign.

AT&amp;T seems to be delighted by the depth and breadth of their deception. AT&amp;T admitted that the company’s 5G E advertising is strictly a narrative to outline how they want the world to work – not a reflection of today’s reality.

In the coming years, 5G promises new levels of innovation and progress that will transform how we live, work and play. It will enable revolutions in smart cities, health care, connected cars, robotics, augmented and virtual reality, entertainment and more.

Sprint is proud to have played a key role in developing 5G standards that will support this faster and more reliable service. By this summer, we will begin offering our customers real mobile 5G in nine major metro areas. And if the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile is approved, the new company will deliver the world’s best 5G network with higher speeds and more capacity, coverage and consistency nationwide, including in rural America. In the meantime, Sprint is committed to taking the necessary steps to successfully launch 5G.

AT&amp;T would rather skip these steps and claim to win the race to 5G by pretending their existing network is 5G. It’s not, and we won’t stand for it – neither should you.

I dislike a lot of Marx's philosophy. But he wasn't an idiot. He accurately observed a host of problems, and had sound analysis for why they existed. I think that when you read the diagnosis of problems described by most extremists, they're generally not far off the mark. It's the solutions they offer up which are always wonting.

&gt;The collective will shift, move, change and adapt despite what our intentions for it are.

But what selective pressures are in place to spur that change? Evolution isn't a guided force. It's random mutation and natural selection. Right now, people who can't cope with the spiritual void in society aren't doing so hot. I think a lot of the crazies who would have gone into monasteries or something are instead replacing religion with politics. And that, whether or not you buy his solutions, Nietzsche was spot on in his analysis of what was to come.

I really don't know how cultural evolution happens, and I've spent a lot of time studying history. There's just not enough data to say for sure how historical events came about *for certain*. And of course there's a confluence of factors. In general though, even if it was something we could adapt to with successive generations, the speed at which we iterate on technology vastly outstrips our generational time. The window for adaptation is much too small.

&gt;But, short of eugenics or a full blown new Dark Age, what is to be done about it?

I have my own solutions. The reality is, for better or worse, there is no going back to the way things were. Technology has changed society too much. Birth control completely changes the dynamics of relationships and family formation, and that's just one technology that arrived recently.

We engineered our way into this problem, and we'll have to engineer our way out of it. By re-engineering humanity at large. In other words, transhumanism.

The monkey wasn't ready for civilization. Rebuild the monkey.

This can take many forms, from genetic tinkering to silicon augmentation or uploading consciousness. It's a ways off. But there is no other solution besides giving the monkey what it needs to be happy (struggle, tribe, higher meaning), which means turning back the clock - which isn't possible. So you change the monkey, because changing the world would be harder.

I don't know. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. And it seems clear to me that there's no top down solution, no government that would just make humans stop being humans. Because that's the problem. Every form of government would work - if it wasn't enacted by humans. Everything would work if we were just better, smarter people. But we're not. We never will be. We're the ultimate child. There's no toy you can give us we won't break.

I guess it's just the most extreme take on virtue ethics. I thought ""just be better"" was silly at first, but as the years have gone on, I think it was right.

&gt;HOW WOULD WE PAY FOR THE FREEDOM DIVIDEND?
&gt;December 28, 2017 by 18 Comments

&gt;It would be easier than you might think. Andrew proposes funding the Freedom Dividend by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value Added Tax of 10 percent. Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally – most would prefer cash with no restriction.

&gt;A Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share. A VAT is nothing new. 160 out of 193 countries in the world already have a Value Added Tax or something similar, including all of Europe which has an average VAT of 20 percent.

&gt;The means to pay for the basic income will come from four sources:

&gt;1. Current spending: We currently spend between $500 and $600 billion a year on welfare programs, food stamps, disability and the like. This reduces the cost of the Freedom Dividend because people already receiving benefits would have a choice between keeping their current benefits and the $1,000, and would not receive both.

&gt;Additionally, we currently spend over 1 trillion dollars on health care, incarceration, homelessness services and the like. We would save $100 – 200+ billion as people would be able to take better care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional. The Freedom Dividend would pay for itself by helping people avoid our institutions, which is when our costs shoot up. Some studies have shown that $1 to a poor parent will result in as much as $7 in cost-savings and economic growth.

&gt;2. A VAT: Our economy is now incredibly vast at $19 trillion, up $4 trillion in the last 10 years alone. A VAT at half the European level would generate $800 billion in new revenue A VAT will become more and more important as technology improves because you cannot collect income tax from robots or software.

&gt;3. New revenue: Putting money into the hands of American consumers would grow the economy. The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy will grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs. This would generate approximately $800 – 900 billion in new revenue from economic growth.

&gt;4. Taxes on top earners and pollution: By removing the Social Security cap, implementing a financial transactions tax, and ending the favorable tax treatment for capital gains/carried interest, we can decrease financial speculation while also funding the Freedom Dividend. We can add to that a carbon fee that will be partially dedicated to funding the Freedom Dividend, making up the remaining balance required to cover the cost of this program.

&gt;Truman strongly supported single-payer health care. Moynihan supported a universal basic income in the 1960s. Dating back to World War II, Democrats sought to make a government-paid education available to as many Americans as possible. If Democrats are marching to the left, that road leads directly back to platforms and politicians who, in their day, commanded wide support and existed firmly in the mainstream of political thought.
&gt;
&gt;What’s more, to label these programs “socialist”—which is to say, far outside the center of the political spectrum—reveals a constrained worldview. For over six decades, center-right parties in Europe—in Britain and France, Germany and Austria, and almost everywhere between—have either participated in or acceded to the very same policies.
&gt;
&gt;In a remarkable way, today’s debate today strongly resembles a broader discussion that occurred in the United States and Europe in the 1940s, amid wartime mobilization and economic reconstruction, and in the decades following.
&gt;
&gt; It’s perfectly reasonable to dispute the progressive agenda on its merits. There are strong policy arguments running in both directions. But to argue that it breaks with the party’s roots, or that it falls dangerously outside the mainstream, is ahistorical

After I arrived, I was ushered into what I thought was the green room. But instead of being wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, I just sat there at a plain round table as my audience was brought to me: five super-wealthy guys — yes, all men — from the upper echelon of the hedge fund world. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the information I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come with questions of their own.

They started out innocuously enough. Ethereum or bitcoin? Is quantum computing a real thing? Slowly but surely, however, they edged into their real topics of concern.

Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one? Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground bunker system and asked, “How do I maintain authority over my security force after the event?”

For all their wealth and power, they don’t believe they can affect the future.

The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down.

This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers — if that technology could be developed in time.
That’s when it hit me: At least as far as these gentlemen were concerned, this was a talk about the future of technology. Taking their cue from Elon Musk colonizing Mars, Peter Thiel reversing the aging process, or Sam Altman and Ray Kurzweil uploading their minds into supercomputers, they were preparing for a digital future that had a whole lot less to do with making the world a better place than it did with transcending the human condition altogether and insulating themselves from a very real and present danger of climate change, rising sea levels, mass migrations, global pandemics, nativist panic, and resource depletion. For them, the future of technology is really about just one thing: escape.”

1906,[],TrippyHipT,,,[],,,,text,t2_orv7s,False,,"Calling this “online voting” and “online connected system” is a total misrepresentation of blockchain technology. The “security beyond” what Google, Facebook Amazon have IS blockchain. 

The simplest way to think of blockchain is as a large distributed ledger of sorts that stores records of transactions. This “ledger” is replicated hundreds of times throughout the public network so it is available to everyone. Every time a transaction occurs, it is updated in ALL of these replicated ledgers, so everyone can see it.

Every time a new transaction is initiated, a block is created with the transactions details and broadcast to all the nodes. Every block carries a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block in the chain, to help establish a sequence of events. Once the authenticity of the transaction is established, that block is linked to the previous block, which is linked to the previous block, creating a chain called blockchain. This chain of blocks is replicated across the entire network, and all cryptographically secured which makes it not only challenging, but almost impossible to hack. I say almost impossible because it would take such a massive amount of processing power that only the invention of quantum computing could come close. 

Then, for the sake of argument, let’s say the time comes when quantum computing is invented. Does that make Blockchain obsolete? NO because you can migrate all the nodes to a quantum server. 

In other words it would be easier for a hacker to completely dismantle “Google, Facebook and Amazon” then it would to dismantle a blockchain system. Not only that but for blockchain to even operate the code has to be completely open source. If their were to be some sort of discrepancy it would be easily and quickly identified by the general public.

Here's the most likely future that is also optimistic for Bitcoin: All of The Bitcoins are mined, which caps the supply of bitcoin. Bitcoin is an arbitrary distributed ledger: it is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it, for access to the markets it allows access to. Bitcoin costs a fuckton to process transfers, and, by its nature, it has to. This discourages use of Bitcoin except for people who have utility in using the anonymous distributed ledger model, which are black market people doing black market shit. Therefore, it is only valuable as an automated middleman, transferring debts anonymously, for use in a very limited marketplace. It's value will track somewhat with The Dollar, or whatever local fiat currency you are using, because the limited marketplace will always track somewhat with the rest of the economy, and the rest of the economy tracks with The Dollar, because the government, through taxes, sets the value of the dollar in relation to the things it taxes, and, everything else in the economy, by an extension of the exchange value of those things taxed. In this way, Bitcoin is nothing more or less than a metaphorical stock in the metaphorical corporation that is ""the creeps and weirdos who trade in Bitcoin."" And, hey, you know what? That's fine for what it is. I once bought pot at a pot store and it used an automatic cash to bitcoin middleman. Maybe I will use it again in the future to buy more drugs, or something I can't predict yet. But this is just a small sliver in the market: just like a stock is. But don't treat it like anything other than a stock in a large company, or a membership fee to use that company when you use it.

Fiat Currency has value because taxes are imposed in it. You HAVE to have dollars to pay taxes. You can't pay taxes in gold, or silver, or oil, or flour, or fucking Pokemon Cards. You pay them in Dollars. If you don't, you go to jail. There, that's the secret, that's why dollars have the value they do, the real, rational, visceral value: violence baby. If you think that Bitcoin will become a common currency, you have to believe that Society has some grand interest in forcing itself to use Bitcoin over Dollars as its common currency. But why? Why would whatever government pops up use a cryptocurrency? It costs so much, is does not allow for controls, the supply is arbitrarily limited. It's just a clunky thing to use. And, even if they did, for some reason, why would they use Bitcoin? Why wouldn't they use something else? And then, the value of your bitcoins are suddenly denominated in New Coins, which is what I am calling them. If New Coins were anonymous, which, if you are using so many more resources to manage, that would kind of be one of the only reasons, why would people still use Bitcoin?

Fiat had lots of problems developing as well and it still is a heavily flawed system after 1000+ years.  The fact is that fiat is an archaic outdated system of value. Some form of cryptocurrency is definitely the future of money, there is no doubt about that, just a matter of how long it takes for society to adopt it. 

The hacks/security flaws that have occurred with cryptos have been flaws in *markets* like the infamous Mt. Gox hack. These are not flaws in cryptocurrency themselves, they are flaws in those privately owned companies' security. Those companies operate like for example, E-Trade, allowing you to trade securities.  Their security are their own responsibility, it has nothing to do with cryptos being secure. You do not need to ever put your crypto in a market , you don't ever need to trade your crypto or store it online in a market. You could trade crypto completely independent of any market. You could buy it with cash face to face, keep it in cold storage, and it would never be at risk to be hacked. Not only that, but if someone stole your cold storage wallet, it would be worthless to them without the secret pneumonic (a list of words that acts as a 'key' that gives access to your wallet) , and you could still access it.  You could have your secret pneumonic locked away in cloud storage that they would need your password/login to access, and you could have 2FA enabled so they'd need to steal your phone as well to access your cloud,  but they'd need your fingerprint to access your phone, and if they somehow did all this,  your pneumonic could again be encrypted,  so they'd need the PGP key to decrypt your pneumonic, and you could have  your PGP key in a safe deposit box in another state, etc etc. You could have infinite levels of security like this if you wanted. The benefits of cryptos are great. You could send 100 million dollars across the globe to anyone you want in minutes, without government oversight. With very little cost.

The implementation of these bans didn't come out of no where and is not a surprise to major market players. These bans are primarily due to youth usage of tobacco products (including vaping) which has exploded over the last 2-3 years. When the 2018 youth tobacco survey was released showing a massive YoY increase in usage (driven by vaping), industry players knew that problems were on the horizon. In 2017 19.6% of high school students used tobacco products (including vape products). In 2018 this number grew to 27.1% of high school students ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806e1.htm?s_cid=osh-vs-mmwr-full-001#F1_down)). 

Its not a coincidence that Juul sold a 35% stake to Altria only a few months after they became aware of 2018 youth tobacco usage numbers, the writing was on the wall that serious (potentially resulting in a complete ban) regulation was coming.  Juul needed access to both Altria's massive lobbying support and for the cash to pour into new products that may actually allow their product to pass FDA premarket authorization (which is why you see them talking about their new juul device that has capabilities like geofencing around schools and potential facial recognition to prevent usage by anyone other than the owner). They knew at that time that if the 2019 numbers showed another increase, that the government was going to act. They were right in this regard since the call for banning/regulation increased when the 2019 youth tobacco survey preliminary data began circulating showing that this number has gone up again to 34% (a number not seen in decades).

Yes vaping is safer than smoking and yes it does reduce harm in current smokers. However the consequence it has had is that 14% of high school students now use tobacco products (vaping) that would likely have never touched them had vaping not existed. How problematic this is depends on how safe vaping is for extremely long term (20+ year) use, which wont be known for years. The government was willing to let current smokers test this out since baring some horrible unknown about safety, it is almost assuredly safer than smoking long term.

One that came to my mind is how almost everyone has a camera in their pocket, and taking photos of people in public is legal. I would imagine my biggest concern would be someone taking a photo of me and putting it on the internet, but that probably wouldn't bother everyone.

Also, I get the argument that people should be able to do what they want with their bodies, but empowerment through nudity is one that I've never personally understood. I think sometimes people mistake ""rights/freedoms"" as ""empowerment"". One's nudity could be thought of as a binary resource (especially with the eternal internet) that is either shared with others or not. Once shared, there are no take-backsies. I could walk around town with dollar bills falling out of my shirt, but I don't think I would find it particularly empowering, even if a day before it had been illegal for women to do so. More importantly, it would be a waste of my resources unless I had a very specific reason for leaving a trail of cash from my ""treasure-chest"".

Finally, there is a difference between the legal ramifications and the social ramifications of any act. In some cases it's easier to change the legal ramifications than it is to change the social ones, and sometimes it is the other way around. I think this is one of those cases where the legal ramifications are both easier to change and less hazardous in general. I think the social ramifications of this act will prove to be enough of a hindrance (and a demand on one's ""nudity resource"") that we won't see a great increase in its practice.

P.S. Seriously, with the development of increasingly complex facial-recognition software and the continuing enmeshment of our physical and social-media lives, I can't imagine why anyone would think this is going to eventually catch on. Although we may just have personal x-ray cameras that see through clothes in the near future too, so maybe it's all moot? Perhaps our very concept of nudity and ""modesty"" will have to be scrapped and rebuilt due to future technology.

The problem is that a lot of black-box credit score statistics based on real world data, without incorporating race into the model (of course),  end up being racially or otherwise biased.    If you make the algorithm optimal and accurate, this will continue, if there are real underlying effects.

For example, maybe poor people who moved to the middle class  haven't had experience in financial matters, so despite a decent income, are more likely to get into financial problems.   If one social group contains more class-shifters in a given income bracket, then maybe that group will end up with lower credit scores.

Personally, I think there's value in ending centralized reporting services because it would force lenders to develop their own independent protocols.  This could open reasonably-priced credit to people with non-traditional back stories, and also makes it less likely that they ALL misjudge repayment capacity in the same way and set themselves up for a 2008-style industry collapse.

2010,[],Ebadd,,,[],,,,text,t2_pbfob,False,,"&gt;&gt;Trump is serious about US divorce from China
-

&gt;*The rest of the world will be pressured to make a choice between Washington and Beijing*
-

&gt;The phrase “new cold war” should never have been coined. Nothing in the original stand off between the Soviet Union and the US could prepare the global economy for what Donald Trump is demanding of America’s trading partners. Moscow and Washington existed in separate orbits. Now the rest of the world is being asked to make a choice between China and the US, two intimately entwined economies. Nor does the label “trade war” begin to capture the dimensions of what this implies.

&gt;America’s partners are being pressured to eject [Huawei](https://www.ft.com/content/a6db14d8-9993-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36), China’s leading telecoms equipment supplier, from their 5G networks. But Mr Trump’s all-or-nothing ultimatum is by no means confined to Huawei. Almost every Chinese product is now under suspicion of concealing the “Manchurian chip” — backdoor technology that can lie dormant until it is activated.

&gt;Israel, for example, is being asked to dump a Chinese construction company that is deepening the port of Haifa. It is also under pressure to cut ties with another Chinese contractor that is building a metro in Tel Aviv.

&gt;Barring commodities such as soyabean or pork, the internet of things makes almost every product a potential dual-use technology in a future US-China conflict. They used to say ploughshares could be converted into swords and vice versa. How about refrigerators? Or children’s toys? Once you start down the road of excluding anything with Chinese-embedded chips, it is hard to know where to stop. The line between legitimate national security concerns and outright paranoia is perilously thin.

&gt;That line was obliterated at a conference in Paris this week with the misleadingly dull title “International cooperation on artificial intelligence”. In reality the gathering — co-hosted by the Washington-based Atlantic Council — was the first effort to stimulate talks between the US and China on the future of AI, which covers pretty much the future of everything, including warfare.

&gt;A Trump administration official, whom I cannot name under the gathering’s “Chatham House rule”, opened by declaring that the US would not co-operate with China on AI while it remained authoritarian. Companies around the world had to choose between two AI systems, said the official. One, led by the US, was based on trust and openness. The other, China, was closed and “malicious”. The latter was exporting “authoritarian software” to every continent.

&gt;A Chinese official responded by saying that the US killed innocent civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan. “Nobody is perfect in human rights,” he said. The exchange almost ended the conference before it began. It offered a troubling foretaste of how much could go wrong between the world’s two great powers. The French co-hosts, which included two former prime ministers, could only make forlorn pleas for dialogue.

&gt;It is an open question whether Mr Trump will agree to a ceasefire with China in their trade war over the coming weeks. Worries about his re-election prospects in 2020 suggest Mr Trump might go for some kind of truce. Such a deal could even include a brief reprieve for Huawei. Quite how he would sell that one to the increasingly hawkish bipartisan voices back home is another matter. Democrats would be sure to attack him for folding too cheaply. Mr Trump’s short-term actions are unpredictable.

&gt;But his larger China strategy is unchanging. It is hard to overstate its radicalism. Over the past 40 years, the US has taken a “win-win” approach to China. The more it could be bound into the global economy, the freer its political system would become. Reality has belied that theory. China is considerably less free today than it was in 2001 when it joined the World Trade Organization. Its social credit system, which ranks citizens based on their behaviour, offers an Orwellian vision of how people can be controlled by authoritarian software. Yet its economy is about three times larger than it was then.

&gt;Mr Trump is thus turning that strategy on its head. We have moved from a “win-win” American vision of globalisation to “win-lose”. In fact, what Mr Trump is pursuing is closer to “lose-lose” — everybody loses if globalisation goes into reverse. Under Mr Trump’s plan, the US ultimately wins because it would lose more slowly than China.

2.  I don't claim Nancy Pelosi is a good person.  I don't claim she is the best politician there ever was OR even the best politician there is now, today.  I don't claim her goals are the best goals.  I don't claim her execution is the best execution.  I don't claim her strategy is the best strategy or that she's the strongest anything.  So--any argument that starts from ""you think X"" and X is any of those things is a lie and you shouldn't bother making it because I'm telling you up front that's not my argument.  What I DO claim is that I have every reason to believe she understands the mechanisms of Congress and the federal government, understands the things that can be done and the things that can't be done (and what's in between) with greater context and fluency than I do and indeed than most people do, and that some of her high level goals likely coincide with MY high level goals (those of expanding Democratic power or defending Democratic power--and her job as Speaker; diminishing and ousting Trump; pushing back and defeating the GOP).  And given those things?  I don't agree with easy arguments about how she's ""weak"" or ""doing it wrong"" that doesn't solve for the problem of her experience, expertise, and seeming progress (slow as it may be) towards those high level goals.

2016,[],shanahanigans,,,[],,,,text,t2_68scz,False,,"&gt; Human labor creates profit.

I disagree with the logic here. Profit is purely a transaction where the cost of producing the good or service is exceeding by the sale price to a willing and able consumer of the good or service.

A very popular way to reduce the cost of producing something (thereby making it more profitable) is by reducing your labor costs. The two most common means for doing this is to automate job functions using machinery and computerization, or to outsource your labor force to a country where wages are lower. Both of these initiatives have been eating away at the American workforce for decades, and we're approaching a real tipping point. 

A common rebuttal to automation is that technological innovation has been happening for all of human history and that ""new jobs are always created"". This argument severely misses the absolutely astonishing gains in computation and networked computers over the last 3 decades. Computerization has radically transformed the world faster than we can even notice it or understand it. Look at how social media has changed how we perceive and interact with each other, for example. And these changes are coming faster and faster, and will only accelerate as machine learning and artificial intelligence accelerate, which of course they are because the business incentive is there. The downside is that only the wealthy capitalist owners and the artificial intelligence programmers will benefit, and the human labor that was relied on to do these tasks fall by the wayside. 

I would amend your statement: CONSUMERS create profit. If there is no demand for a good, then no profit can be obtained from producing it. Workforce participation rate is the lowest in decades, and a higher percentage of people who are ""employed"" are in low paying service sector jobs that are being automated away as I write this. And I should mention those jobs, in addition to barely being subsistence level, tend to be unsatisfying and even soul-crushing work as it is.

The real danger of automation is that the displaced many will be economically insecure and not able to properly function as consumers in the economy. Focusing on the well-being of our citizens, and having an economy where productivity gains are fairly distributed throughout it, is absolutely necessary if we're going to weather the storm of the 21st century economy, and not have our society come apart at the seams due to people who feel - rightly so - that they don't have a purpose and have no value.

People have value because theyre human fucking beings, with hearts and minds and loved ones. A person's worth extends far beyond their annual income, and it's time we started thinking and acting like that were the case. We have all the resources in the world to make it so, the only thing stopping it is people who are so focused on keeping others down that they refuse to help lift themselves and the rest of society up.",1568780432,{},f0nto2u,False,t3_d5o973,False,True,t1_f0ndnj6,/r/politics/comments/d5o973/new_poll_shows_andrew_yang_beating_kamala_harris/f0nto2u/,1568780433.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2017,[],PLaTinuM_HaZe,,,[],,,,text,t2_ahalj,False,,"Here's some of the major problems, first, taking from the rich and giving to the poor is good in concept but how realistic is it? Companies can just buy smaller companies in another country and move their ""Headquarters"" there and avoid US taxes. Wealthy people find ways to hide their money, negotiate compensation structures that avoid taxes like low salaries but high stock option payouts. Point is that money finds away around these types of taxes or you end up with a mass exodus of money like what can be seen going on in France right now. 

Second, Warren and Sanders blaming the rich and corporations is the lefts version of Trump blaming immigrants, it feeds off the unhappiness and anger of the people of the lower middle class that have consistently seen their wages decrease or lose their jobs to automation or outsourcing. The problem is what do you want a corporation to do? They are there to make money. The problem is that people want someone to blame for a shrinking middle class but there is not person or company to blame, it's due to automation and artificial intelligence which isn't sexy to blame in politics. 

Here's why Warren and Sanders plans are bandaids and not solutions: They want to cancel college loan debt and have free college right? But that doesn't address the real problem which is why has college tuition 3X outpaced inflation and instead just defers the cost to taxes which makes it feel like you aren't paying for it. Warren and Sanders want $15/hr minimum wage but the problem with that is those jobs won't exist in 10 years, all of it is being automated away, increasing the minimum wage to $15/hr only gives companies the financial justification to move towards automation sooner as can be seen with McDonalds beginning to roll out kiosks nationwide and taking away cashiers in anticipation of this. What happens when call center jobs disappear? Truck drivers? Uber drivers? Accountants? Office and clerical work? Radiologists? Orthodontists? So the minimum wage raise is nice in theory but doesn't solve anything if those jobs won't exist in 10 years.

When someone leaves my firm, it often takes us a year  to fill the open position because there just aren't enough CPAs out  there. Pay rises substantially when there's a worker shortage and also  shrinks when there's saturation. It's why most liberal arts majors pay  trash salaries. The world only needs so many gender studies majors.

which is funny, many liberal arts jobs are ironically harder to automate.

2051,[],Pianobyme,,,[],,,,text,t2_7i0dk,False,,"""It’s true that agriculture went from 40 percent of the workforce in 1900 to 2 percent in 2017 and we nonetheless managed to both grow more food and create many wondrous new jobs during that time. It’s also true that service-sector jobs multiplied in many unforeseen ways and absorbed most of the workforce after the Industrial Revolution. People sounded the alarm of automation destroying jobs in the 19th century—the Luddites destroying textile mills in England being the most famous—as well as in the 1920s and the 1960s, and they’ve always been wildly off the mark. Betting against new jobs has been completely ill-founded at every point in the past. So why is this time different?

**Essentially, the technology in question is more diverse and being implemented more broadly over a larger number of economic sectors at a faster pace than during any previous time. The advent of big farms, tractors, factories, assembly lines, and personal computers, while each a very big deal for the labor market, were orders of magnitude less revolutionary than advancements like artificial intelligence, machine learning, self-driving vehicles, advanced robotics, smartphones, drones, 3D printing, virtual and augmented reality, the Internet of things, genomics, digital currencies, and nanotechnology. These changes affect a multitude of industries that each employ millions of people. The speed, breadth, impact, and nature of the changes are considerably more dramatic than anything that has come before**.

It is true that this would be the first time that the labor market did not meaningfully adapt and adjust. But Ben Bernanke, the former head of the Federal Reserve, said in May 2017, “You have to recognize realistically that AI is qualitatively different from an internal combustion engine in that it was always the case that human imagination, creativity, social interaction, those things were unique to humans and couldn’t be replicated by machines. We are coming close to the point where not only cashiers but surgeons might be at least partially replaced by AI.” Fifty-eight percent of cross-sector experts polled by Bloomberg in 2017 agreed with the statement “it is in fact different this time” and that the labor market disruptions will be severe and unprecedented. The consensus is growing.

Economists in particular seem predisposed to suggest that all will be well. People invoke the Industrial Revolution and say, “We have heard these fears before, all the way back to the Luddites. New jobs always appear.” There is an almost magical embracing of ignorance cloaked in humility: “It is unknowable what the new jobs will be. It is beyond human wisdom. It would be arrogant to guess. I just know that they will be there.” Oftentimes, the person who thinks all will be okay is guilty of what I call constructive institutionalism—operating from a default stance that things will work themselves out. This is, to my mind, a disavowal of judgment and reality. History repeats itself until it doesn’t. No one has an incentive to sound the alarm. To do so could make you seem uneducated and ignorant of history, and perhaps even negative and shrill. 

It also would make you right in this case. 

There has never been a computer smarter than humans until now. Self-driving cars are a different type of leap forward than the invention of cars themselves. Data is about to supplant human judgment. And on and on. It’s like the warning you get when investing—sometimes the past is not the best indicator of the present or future. 

It’s important also to remember that things got quite rough during the Industrial Revolution; in America this is the period between 1870 and 1914 when factories and assembly lines absorbed millions of workers before World War I. There was considerable upheaval, and the role of the state evolved in response to unrest. Labor unions rose up in 1886 and pushed for increased worker rights, 40-hour work weeks, and defined pensions. Labor Day was inaugurated as a national holiday in 1894 in response to a railway strike that killed 30 people and caused $80 million in damages—the equivalent of $2.2 billion today. The United States instituted universal high school; in 1910 only 19 percent of American teenagers were in a high school, and barely 9 percent of 18-year-olds graduated. By 1940, 73 percent of teenagers were in high school and the median American graduated. The women’s suffrage movement culminated in success in 1920. Socialism, communism, and anarchism were all vital political movements. There was a constant whiff of revolution. Even if you rely solely on history, you’d expect a lot of conflict and change ahead as the labor pool shifts due to technological advances.""

There would sooner be a post-scarcity society built on the backs of self-maintaining Strong A.I's than any infrastructure and cooperation would be ready for communism, though that still won't be happening for quite some time.

On the other hand, there are several authoritarian measures which could alleviate various inequalities and even stimulate scientific progress if executed properly by a technocratic assembly that isn't obsessed with assigning values or currency in general as much as communism was, so much as focusing completely on practical utilitarianism.

The Original Sin of most socialist movements is seeking to address an inequality between humans while ignoring the most important part of the equation - the humans. The organism itself. The first order of business for a transhumanist technocratic authority would be outlawing uncontrolled and unaccountable chaotic reproduction - new children can only be born by filing a request that will be approved when deemed necessary and viable ( economically and otherwise, for the child's upbringing costs ). Genetic engineering will be heavily practiced. Child rearing costs are no longer disparate, but covered directly by the government via a uniform child tax. 

Luxury product reform - there are astronomical amounts of manpower, time and resources being spent in capitalistic system on producing completely useless crap. That workers who produce utilitarian goods and services choose to purchase those and enrich the luxury providers in turn who then pay their employees is, contrary to capitalist perception, completely irrelevant from a utilitarian perception. It's still a circulation of precious resources and manpower that is being toward non-useful workers, value obtained from useful work being channeled to non-useful products, trickling down the hierarchy. And besides, those goods are mostly available to people with high concentrations of capital at any rate.

Ban the domestic sale of all *highly* expensive luxury products - Jewels, thousand dollar clothes, furniture, perfumes etc and convert them into exports. If foreign nationals wish to obtain the products, they can spend *their* currency on doing so - which will then be exchanged for electronics, medicine, oil, etc.

Food scarcity - it doesn't have to exist whatsoever in 2019. Impose quotas on foodstuff purchases ( Mind you, not ones anyone should be passing unless they're buying preposterous amounts ), re-distribute the surplus among the needy based on dietary considerations, food producers can slightly raise prices on the now lesser supply and higher demand if need be to compensate themselves. Alternatively and/or jointly - establish state factories for the production of cheap, nutritious massively effective food sources like genetically modified algae protein bars. A few people with very little maintenance can produce enough to feed tens and hundreds of thousands. Use those as staples for the hungry and you won't have to worry about covering that angle via welfare anymore.

The list of options goes on, most of them being fairly humanitarian and technically simple and plausible - and even a single one of them has the potential to essentially reduce poverty by a magnitude unseen since the industrial revolution.

A lot of the crap that gets spouted by the anti-gmo crowd is almost always completely misinformed on the subject. It's basically anti-vax territory stuff, as the sole source of their consternation is based off of a single debunked study on the rates of cancer for glyphosate (a product Monsanto doesn't even hold the patent to anymore).

Nevermind the misinformation that exists within the organic community about what it means to be organic or their adherence to the naturalism fallacy.

The Apple IIe was my first computer. I can still hear the sound it made booting up, the noises the floppy disc drive made. We had one at home when I was in grade school... and it was extremely unusual for the time. We were certainly the only family on our block that had a home computer, probably the only family within some number of miles. My dad was a relatively early adopter for home internet. Not ARPANET early, but we had eWorld while that was still a thing. When it went defunct, we got (shudder) AOL. We had a whole series of beige Macs. I had a Titanium Powerbook in college. In high school and college I went to and hosted LAN parties with friends; I learned about Windows and Unix; I learned how to set up networks and diagnose networking issues pretty early on, because you had to if you wanted to play.

I'm not a programmer and my degree is actually in electrical engineering, but I have been doing various amounts of programming since I was small... from Basic on the Apple IIe to C++ on Mac and Linux... I did a few little projects in PHP when I moonlighted as a freelance web designer in the early 2000s, I've used Perl and Python fairly extensively in my working life as an adult... I wouldn't really put my skills up against a legit software developer because it's never been my primary focus and it's pretty much all self-taught. The only formal computer science classes I ever took were in Java, a language which I still avoid like the plague.

I got a GMail account when you still had to be invited. I used to use Mapquest, AltaVista, and Babelfish before the Google services surpassed all those. I bought an iPod Touch when they first came out and brought it in to work to show it off to my coworkers.

Anyway, I can relate. I get frustrated when, every few years, somebody in the news comes out and claims to have built an 'AI' that can 'pass the Turing Test.' Right, chatterbots have existed for decades. SmarterChild, Eliza, etc. I wrote one of my own once in college using the AOL Instant Messenger API... well, sort of, mine obviously wasn't very good, but I understood most of the principles behind that sort of thing at a high level. I went through a phase where I was fascinated by Markov chains. A friend in high school and college showed me a few simple examples of genetic algorithms and I was fascinated by those for a while... although I had no idea of how widely applicable they would end up being years down the line, I was mainly thinking about how to make better video game enemies with them.

The time we came of age was perfect for learning about this stuff as it developed. I don't think any generation before or after us is better equipped to understand the dynamic range, from a low-level, all the way up to bot nets and modern social media influencing.

However, I guess I'm a bit more optimistic about the future. I do think government is falling behind, but I think that's more because of the particular people who happen to be in government than because society as a whole is falling behind. They used to tell us that 'everybody in the future will have to know computers.' That turned out to be kind of true and kind of not true, as I think you articulated pretty well. Everyone knows how to use computers (or phones now, but of course they are essentially computers) for facebook, mobile games, etc. at a user level. But very few people understand them in an in-depth way... and that's jarring for people like us, because it used to be that everyone who owned a computer understood it in a technical way. My family's Apple IIe belonged to my grandfather before we had it, and he had manuals that told you how all of the serial and parallel interfaces worked in enough detail that you could build your own peripherals if you wanted to. He knew how the floppy drive worked to the degree that he could defeat some of the more innovative copy protection of the day.

But, I guess the thing to keep in mind is that now EVERYBODY has a phone, and back when we were growing up and coming of age, only technical people had computers. The technical ability of the average user has dropped considerably in our time, but that's mainly because the number of users is astronomically higher than it used to be.

I work with a lot of young engineers as part of my job... people who graduated within the last couple of years... and I don't want to get too far into the specifics of what I work on, but a lot of it has to do with old systems from the 1990s and before. Young people don't have the same background that we do on it, but they pick it up quickly. The ones I work with are very smart, and they usually don't need to have things explained twice. Additionally, there are technical tools available now that are more available and more useable than when we were coming of age. I wish I'd had the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi when I was in high school. I learned about micro-controllers and embedded systems in college, but everything they had back then was so awkward to work with and so expensive compared to what you can get now. I wish I'd had 3D printing back then; so many of the projects I built were just piles of soldered-together components because I couldn't find a box the right size and shape for them.

The Maker movement basically didn't exist when we were kids, and I guess that's one of the places where I see hope. The best way to understand things is to build them. And a lot of the tools for building things, even fairly complex electronic things, are becoming much more accessible than they used to be. It used to be that Radio Shack was the best way to get components... if they didn't have what you needed, you could maybe get it from a parts catalog or if you needed it fast, you could drive a few miles out of your way to wherever the nearest mom and pop electronic shop was and ask the grumpy old man who ran it if he happened to have one. Now you can go online and get almost anything you can imagine direct from the manufacturer in China. It's incredible what's available what you can build now. And yes, most people can't or won't do it, but when we were kids most people didn't teach themselves basic on their home computers either.

On the biological front, yeah, we are pretty much genetically identical to the bipedal apes we are descended from, but biology is more than genetics. There's also culture, literature, oral tradition, language... none of that is encoded in our DNA. Those things have taken us a long way, and they've developed over time. Society hasn't overcome its prejudices, but we've developed the language for talking about them, and that didn't exist a few generations ago. You're my age, so you know what it meant for a gay man to be outed when were kids vs what it means today. We've progressed. Not in all respects, and we shouldn't be too proud of ourselves because there is still a very long way to go, but my point is that we are teachable. That's another thing that gives me hope.

From [Yang's Freedom Dividend FAQ on his website](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/):

&gt;Wouldn’t that cause rampant inflation?

&gt;The federal government recently printed $4 trillion for bank bailouts in its quantitative easing program with no inflation. Our plan for UBI uses mostly money already in the economy. In monetary economics, leading theory states that inflation is based on changes in the supply of money. The Freedom Dividend has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a Value-Added Tax.

&gt;It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or inapplicability – primarily housing, education, and healthcare. The real issue isn’t universal basic income, it’s whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce prices in different sectors.

Also:

&gt;Wouldn’t the Value-Added Tax just get passed on to consumers, “cancelling out” the UBI?

&gt;No.

&gt;First, not all goods will be subject to the VAT. Staples such as groceries and clothing will be excluded from the VAT.

&gt;Second, the assumption that the entire VAT would get passed on to consumers is incorrect. Consumers are price sensitive, and the demand for most goods is at least somewhat elastic. While prices will likely increase on many goods, the increase will, for the most part, be smaller than the VAT as producers find more efficient ways to produce goods and adjust prices to maximize profitability.

&gt;Finally, an individual would have to buy a lot of non-exempt items in order to “cancel out” the value of the UBI. Assuming all goods are subject to a VAT and the entire VAT is passed on to consumers, an individual would have to buy $120,000 worth of items before the extra costs associated with a VAT “use up” their UBI. As stated above, those two assumptions are wrong, and most people aren’t spending nearly that much money.",1569443254,{},f1ffag5,True,t3_d8y2r3,False,True,t1_f1fefeh,/r/politics/comments/d8y2r3/andrew_yang_says_teaching_people_financial/f1ffag5/,1569443256.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can you substantiate any of your claims regarding rent? What impact would less restrictive zoning laws have? How would greater geographic mobility affect rent prices? How would increased home ownership affect rent prices? There are five times more vacant homes than homeless people in the US, what happens when this large unused supply is made available? 

""at least some"" - interesting choice of wording. How much is some? 20%? 50%? 5%?

Your rent argument (not to mention the demand-pull inflation argument) sounds suspiciously like the hack libertarian arguments against minimum wage. Are you sure you aren't a libertarian trojan horse?

&gt; Not going to address the inflation thing 

Interesting.

&gt; because other articles directly contradict these

Such as? 

&gt; I've addressed it fully myself numerous times

Where? Looking through a few pages of your comments, all I can find is some demand-pull inflation arguments which have already been addressed 

""any added demand pushes businesses to use idle cash to expand production in order to meet demand. Investment in production will lead to greater supply helping to offset inflationary pressures."" 

""UBI can be indexed to inflation""

The Alaska permanent fund is also relevant here despite your eagerness to dismiss it. Granted it is a fraction of the amount proposed in the FD, but that does not explain why it has had the consistent, long term, *opposite* effect on CPI that you are predicting with the FD. 

Demand-pull inflation is also addressed in the articles I linked that you seemingly care not to read. 

&gt;Where demand already exists and supply is already paid for, demand is unlikely to change as basic income simply replaces one method of payment with another. E.g., replacing food stamps with basic income is unlikely to make people buy more milk. It just means people will likely buy the same amount of milk with cash instead of SNAP.
Where demand is actually increased, depending on the good or service, supply can also easily be increased, be increased with some investment in capacity, or not be increased. It is this third case where prices can rise, and points more to increases in prices for luxuries, and not basic goods and services.

https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7

And also here by the same author: https://medium.com/basic-income/supply-and-demand-variables-d8d15cf85368

&gt; Comparing the results of an entirely different UBI on an entirely different scale to the FD is misleading.

Sufficiently vague to be a non-answer. Be specific. Give examples.

&gt; Referring to the FD simply as ""UBI"" implies all UBI is the same, which is false.

Nowhere did I imply ""all UBI proposals are the same."" This is some real straw-grasping. I can use the terms interchangeably if I'm describing an effect I believe the FD will have. You have to demonstrate why the stated effects or observed benefits of UBI/cash transfer experiments that I cited don't apply to the FD to actually have a point... 

&gt; It is exactly the same thing many Libertarians have proposed

Now we've gone from ""every"" libertarian to ""many"" libertarians...

Still wrong. They propose it in place of ALL welfare and without option. And they don't propose it in addition to things like M4A, forgiving student loan debt, child education for all, paid family leave, FTT, universal financial counseling etc.

And even granting this (which I don't), so what? Some libertarians also propose we have a police force, does that make having a police force a bad idea? Stop the silly guilt by association attacks and stick to actual arguments. 

Also interesting how you've left the following completely unaddressed: 

&gt;Yang wants to scale the benefits of these people according to the impact of the VAT. But it's not yet an official policy proposal so let's say he doesn't for the sake of argument.

&gt; About 50-70% of VATs get passed to the consumer if you look at existing data on VATs. Yang's VAT is 10%, so that's a 5-7% increase on prices of VAT applied goods and services. But wait, Yang wants to tailor it to luxury goods and exempt or lower the rate for lower income consumer staples, as many countries with a VAT already do, so the effect on these people will be marginal - even less than the sum total of 5-7% even if the benefits don't scale.

&gt; Then you have to consider:

&gt; -household income - most of these people don't live in isolation or even are dependent on others - these people will inevatibly include those not on or on less than $1k/m in welfare - their households will see a rise in income.

&gt; -rise in non-profit work

&gt; -huge failures of current welfare programs. E.g. there are millions living under the poverty line with no or few benefits.

&gt; -general benefits to society produced by FD will effect these people. E.g. lower crime rates obviously will benefit the most vulnerable in society.

&gt; -Yang's other policies that directly benefit the poor and directly compound the benefits of the FD like prosperity grants and universal financial counseling.

&gt;-being able to opt into FD as soon as you start adulthood provides the financial security such that less people even end up in circumstances where they require welfare.

Do you concede these points?

&gt; Just because welfare programs are underfunded doesn't mean welfare should be scrapped, 

Many of the issues with means-tested welfare aren't a question of funding. These were already presented to you in the previous reply but you've conveniently ignored them for some reason. 

E.g. 1: there are millions living under the poverty line with no or few benefits. It's not because they aren't eligible, and it's not because the programs they are eligible for are underfunded. In large part it is due to the social stigma (which is another huge problem in itself), and also due to the labyrinth of bureaucracy and means testing complicating changing circumstances.

E.g. 2: UBI eliminates the perverse incentive traps that discourage people from finding additional sources of income (remaining in the required income bracket in order to retain welfare).

Conversely, what benefits do means-tested welfare programs offer that the FD doesn't?

&gt; it should be improved.

I agree. Let's remove means-testing and give everyone double what the average welfare recipient receives. 

&gt; private business, (which would substantially benefit from the FD)

I agree. And so will the workers to an even larger degree.",1569438784,{},f1f857x,False,t3_d8y2r3,False,True,t1_f1evlgs,/r/politics/comments/d8y2r3/andrew_yang_says_teaching_people_financial/f1f857x/,1569438785.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What the fuck does it matter what it's *called?* People aren't going to go for something called ""universal basic income"" because it *sounds* like you're getting money for doing nothing, while ""freedom dividend"" strikes at two points Yang needs to make: 1) American society is about freedom, and 2) this dividend gives people a little more freedom to do what they want to do.

&gt;When on the debate stage he never gets into *why* UBI is needed

He rarely ever gets *any* time on the debate stages, but when he does—and in interviews if you'd bother to listen—he gives specific examples of the types of people it can help: a waitress getting harassed at her job who doesn't feel financially secure enough to quit can now do just that, a family can get a little breathing room, a student can start paying back debts, someone could literally just buy a guitar and explore their passions. Yang has talked *extensively* about the benefits of UBI and how it's not just about giving people ""free money""; it's about the idea that life should be about more than making it to your next paycheck. It's about the pursuit of happiness.

&gt;he comes across as someone who is just promising money for power.

I disagree. To me—and again, I'm not voting for him and don't want him to be president—he comes across as a guy who sees the writing on the wall in terms of automation, UBI, etc and doesn't see other people talking about it so he's only on the stage to move the conversation. Personally I don't think he truly expects to win at all; I think he's just trying to solidify UBI as an idea people don't scoff at the same way Bernie managed to get M4A into the platform.

&gt;He's absolutely a joke and he hurts Democrats and UBI with the reckless way he campaigns.

Completely disagree. Democrats are benefiting from Yang pulling in additional people who otherwise didn't give a fuck about the Democratic platform, he's promoting UBI at a time when nobody else is, he's talking about automation when nobody else is, he actually has *compassion* in a way that a lot of the candidates don't, etc. Yang is not some Jill Stein. He's a guy trying to make a difference. He's not a practiced politician so yes he has cringe-worthy moments more than he should, but his heart is pretty clearly in the right place.

For a ""liberal"" party that prides itself on a ""diversity"" of ideas and cultures, it is always depressing to me just how closed-minded the Democratic Party is and how fast they try to shut down anyone who doesn't fit their narrative. It's just like Bernie's run in 2016 all over again. These are the same arguments levied against him about how he's ""hurting"" the party and making universal healthcare into a ""joke.""

Not necessary. 

&gt; doesn't account for the immediate inflation

What inflation? 

https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7

https://medium.com/basic-income/evidence-and-more-evidence-of-the-effect-on-inflation-of-free-money-a3dcc2a9ea9e

&gt;**The partial basic income provided in Alaska in the form of their Permanent Fund Dividend directly counters the fear of inflation with thirty years of a once larger CPI that began to grow at a slower rate than the rest of the country immediately following its introduction.**
Alaska isn’t even the only evidence we have for the possibility that a basic income might even reduce inflation instead of increasing it.

&gt;In 2011, the government in Kuwait decided to give every one of its 1.155 million citizens $4,000 USD each. That’s even higher than the Alaskan dividend and about one third of a potential US basic income. It was called the Amiri Grant.
Again, the New Zero Argument suggests inflation should increase, and this was a common fear in Kuwait as well. They were even especially worried because inflation was already a problem, so it seemed like the worst possible time for such a huge citizen demogrant.
So what did happen?
Nine months later…
“With a great deal of public spending coming on-stream, and the effects of the substantial “Amiri” grant of KD1000 ($3605) awarded to every Kuwaiti, inflationary pressure is a concern. However, **inflation dropped to an 11-month low of 4.6 percent in July**, the last month for which figures were available, and the rate is expected to average 4.7 percent for full-year 2011, according to international press reports using figures from Kuwait’s Central Statistics Office.”
Six more months later…
“Beyond the activity data, Kuwait’s macroeconomic outlook continues to look very solid. **After peaking at 6 percent in December 2010, [4k grant to every citizen came in in 2011] consumer price inflation had decelerated to 3.8 percent by February 2012.**”

&gt;in Kuwait, just as in Alaska, giving a large amount of free money to citizens did not only not result in increased inflation, but instead in decreased inflation.

I'll add any added demand pushes businesses to use idle cash to expand production in order to meet demand. Investment in production will lead to greater supply helping to offset inflationary pressures.

And the fact that it is in place of most forms of welfare means demand will not even increase that much for basic essentials.

And it can also be indexed to inflation which Yang has indicated.

&gt; decreases relative spending power of those who need benefits

Yang wants to scale the benefits of these people according to the impact of the VAT. But it's not yet an official policy proposal so let's say he doesn't for the sake of argument. 

About 50-70% of VATs get passed to the consumer if you look at existing data on VATs. Yang's VAT is 10%, so that's a 5-7% increase on prices of VAT applied goods and services. But wait, Yang wants to tailor it to luxury goods and exempt or lower the rate for lower income consumer staples, as many countries with a VAT already do, so the effect on these people will be marginal - even less than the sum total of 5-7% even if the benefits don't scale.

Then you have to consider:

-household income - most of these people don't live in isolation or even are dependent on others - these people will inevatibly include those not on or on less than $1k/m in welfare - their households will see a rise in income. 

-rise in non-profit work

-huge failures of current welfare programs. E.g. there are millions living under the poverty line with no or few benefits.

-general benefits to society produced by FD will effect these people. E.g. lower crime rates obviously will benefit the most vulnerable in society.

-Yang's other policies that directly benefit the poor and directly compound the benefits of the FD like prosperity grants and universal financial counseling.

-being able to opt into FD as soon as you start adulthood provides the financial security such that less people even end up in circumstances where they require welfare.

&gt; further subsidizes corporations who refuse to pay their workers a living wage

A UBI would improve labor market efficiency, location flexibility and bargaining power for workers.

&gt; uses a regressive tax that falls directly on consumers

The pass through to consumers is about 50-70%. In any case, you will have to spend $150k+ on VAT applied products to lose more to the VAT than you receive from the FD. 

&gt; is literally identical to every other Libertarian UBI plan that aims to dismantle welfare

This angle is just hilarious.

&gt; dismantle welfare

And in turn enabling the greatest expansion of the social safety net in the history of the world? 

In ""dismantling welfare"" he is replacing it with a far superior safety net.

The vast majority of people on welfare receive much less than $1000 a month. The average payment is close to half that. Anyone receiving more on their current plan can keep it, and a few benefits do stack with the FD like SSDI, certain VA benenits etc.

Then you have to consider the failures of the current welfare programs to understand Yang's preference for FD. E.g. there are millions living under the poverty line with no or few benefits due to the the labyrinth of bureaucracy, means testing complicating changing circumstances, social stigma etc.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/13-million-people-in-poverty-are-disconnected-from-the-social-safety-net-most-of-them-are-white/2019/02/04/807516a0-2598-11e9-81fd-b7b05d5bed90_story.html

What's really telling is a huge amount of charity work simply compensates for the failures of welfare - [here's an example:](https://www.trusselltrust.org/2016/04/15/foodbank-use-remains-record-high/) 42% of this charity's referrals were due to benefit delays, sanctions and other changes. UBI is far more efficient in covering basic needs like having enough money for food, therefore the budgets of charities are freed up to focus on other needs. You would also expect an uptick in volunteering and non-profit work. Every UBI study indicates substantial benefits to mental health - less stress, increased sense of agency and security etc. When people are less stressed they are more likely to volunteer. [Work commitments are one of the largest barriers to volunteering](https://data.ncvo.org.uk/volunteering/motivations-and-barriers/), UBI allows you to work less general hours, less overtime, part time work more viable. Yang's prosperity grants are also HUGE for non-profits: https://www.yang2020.com/policies/prosperity-grants/ 

Another reason UBI is superior to means tested welfare is it eliminates the perverse incentive traps that discourage people from finding additional sources of income (remaining in the required income bracket in order to retain welfare).

More of [the general benefits to society of UBI have been observed time and again](https://twitter.com/scottsantens/status/1119718391949004800). These are powerful secondary benefits that compound the actual cash assistance.

&gt; libertarian

First of all Yang's UBI is substantially different to the negative income tax most libertarians like Milton Friedman support, secondly any notion that Yang is some libertarian ""trojan horse"" as the chapo shitposts go is ridiculous when you consider his extremely progressive platform including but not limited to: M4A, child education for all, paid family leave, student loan forgiveness, carbon tax, redirecting a portion of the DOD budget to building infrastructure, prosperity grants, democracy dollars, financial transaction tax, stricter gun control.",1569428332,{},f1eqykf,False,t3_d8y2r3,False,True,t1_f1djoos,/r/politics/comments/d8y2r3/andrew_yang_says_teaching_people_financial/f1eqykf/,1569428333.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 I don't like unions, we have advanced into a society where their place is very limited.

Trade unions that offer training and education for trades that are needed yet sparse are still necessary, however the inflatable rat mobster stuff, has got to go!

I am all for social programs to educate and enrich our society, but I think some care should be taken to address those that exploit the system. I grew up super poor, I know its like to live off food stamps, and get food pantry boxes just to have something eat, all while living under the roof of a working single mother trying to make ends meet. Free lunch programs for kids shouldn't go away, but yes again, weed out those whom exploit. 

Healthcare is important too. We need it, we all do, come on. We are approaching our next technological revolution, as tech accelerates, quantum computing, propulsion, sustainability, energy, genetics and other life sciences, medicine, as we advance in these ways our social IQ should be advancing as well. No one should be suffering through some illness because of lack of healthcare. WTF people, we dont have to be barbarians anymore.

Education, we all need it. Even if you're going to inherit the family farm and you don't think you need to be educated past 8th grade. Get real dude, get educated, study agriculture and develop the future of farming. That is just one example, there should be a place for everyone somewhere.

&gt;  
&gt;Never let it be said that Andrew Yang can’t read an audience. He came to meet with the Des Moines Register editorial board armed with an imaginative remedy for a struggling industry near and dear to our hearts — community newspapers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the next hour, Yang thoroughly charmed editors in the room while laying out innovative and tech-savvy ideas for all sorts of problems. He was so charismatic — incorporating personal stories of himself and others into his policy discussion — that we almost didn’t care when we realized some elements of his plans would never get off the ground.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yang is the [sixth Democratic presidential candidate](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2019/07/18/election-2020-democratic-presidential-candidate-andrew-yang-live-interview-register-editorial-boar/1766904001/) who has met with the Register since the November 2018 general election. Here are some first impressions:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Who is this guy?** Like many voters, we knew little about Yang before starting to prepare for his visit. He was born in New York and lives there now. His parents immigrated, legally, from Taiwan before he was born. He humorously describes his five months as a Columbia-educated lawyer — “Hated it.” He worked at two unsuccessful dot-com businesses — “My parents still told people I was a lawyer, because it was an easier story,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;He joined a friend at a small test-preparation firm. With Yang as CEO, the company “grew to become No. 1 in the U.S.,” he said, and was bought out by Kaplan. The new millionaire turned to philanthropy, starting the nonprofit Venture for America, aimed at helping to launch entrepreneurs. He stepped down as CEO when he announced he was running for president.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Giving away money:** For someone who professes to be the least ideological candidate in the race, Yang’s signature issue is so far left even Sen. Bernie Sanders doesn’t support it. Yang proposes a “Freedom Dividend” — a form of universal basic income — to every American adult of $1,000 a month. And he makes the idea sound not only dream-worthy but almost doable.  
&gt;  
&gt;He sees the plan as a way for the country to transition into a new economy driven by automation — such as self-driving trucks that could displace millions of drivers in the next decade. While the plan would cost trillions, he argues that it would stimulate the economy and save  “tens of billions” being spent on things like incarceration, services for the homeless and emergency-room care.   
&gt;  
&gt;“It would channel billions of dollars right here to Iowa. It would create about 48,000 new jobs here in Iowa … because we know it would go to car repairs you’ve been putting off and tutoring services and the occasional night out and health care and education bills and day care and everything else,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;He is personally [giving that dividend to an Iowa family for the next 12 months](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/06/11/2020-andrew-yang-universal-basic-income-iowa-family-kyle-pam-christiansen-president-iowa-caucus/1413666001/), targeting it to a worthy soul who moved home to take care of his mother, who has cancer. And while a form of universal basic income might be a solution for at-home caregivers, who perform valuable work for free, his plan would also pay $1,000 a month to billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.   
&gt;  
&gt;“He’ll get his thousand bucks, too, just to remind him he is an American,” Yang said, adding that means testing would be a bureaucratic nightmare. He also rejected the idea of cost-of-living adjustments, saying it would be too easy for people to game the system.   
&gt;  
&gt;Part of the attraction of the plan is its simplicity — but it’s the details that would likely kill it in Congress.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yang brings this same mix of intellectual agility steeped in compassion to issues like corporate responsibility and health care ([he advocates for single-payer Medicare for All,](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medicare-for-all/) but with a provision for homeopathic treatments like acupuncture or herbal therapy). His website lists platform positions on more than 100 issues ranging from getting rid of the penny to “quantum computing and encryption standards.”  
&gt;  
&gt;One editorial board member was blown away: “He belongs among the front ranks of candidates. He has obviously thought deeply about the fourth industrial revolution, has fresh ideas and a refreshing non-ideological approach to governing. Meeting with him is like sitting in on a graduate seminar, with ideas sparking but a relaxed, not-too-nerdy atmosphere.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Another editor agreed it’s a pleasure to listen to Yang, but questioned whether he had thought some of his policies all the way through. For example, his idea for saving community newspapers, while noble, includes taxpayer-funded grants for journalists. One of the tenets of credible journalism is that it needs to be independent — and that means journalists don’t get their salary from the government.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bottom line:** Even if we don’t agree with all of his ideas, Yang deserves more attention than he’s getting in this crowded presidential field. If voters are serious about actually solving problems, as opposed to just winning the next election, Yang’s website [www.yang2020.com](https://www.yang2020.com/) should be on their reading list.",1563675184,{},euchesb,True,t3_cftyah,False,True,t3_cftyah,/r/politics/comments/cftyah/iowa_caucus_first_impressions_andrew_yang/euchesb/,1563675185.0,-6,True,,False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,1563761586.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At it's very fundamental sense: A government's money, it's currency, is a PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE, akin to a highway.  It exists as a common resource, to facilitate economic transactions, and for workers to store the benefit of their labor across seasons (to include the seasons of childhood and retirement years).

When a wealthy person hoards their wealth - they withhold it from everyone else.  But as a public resource, the government should have the ability to confiscate that property for the good of the whole of civilization. (and they do - in the form of taxation).  

The main problem with money, right now, is that it's dumb.  The dollar exists as a dumb unit, and only adjusts it's value as a response to economic forces; all dollars are the same, and can be spent (or not) however a person wants it.

In the future, money could be ""coded"" with behaviors or contracts. (this was the reasoning behind Etherium - and other than this feature, I'm not a fan of cryptocurrency).   Money could be created that makes it impossible to mis-spend (or ""malinvest"") in these ways: buying lying advertisements and media PR campaigns, or bribery.  It only makes sense that a public resource should be regulated to only be used in ways that benefit the public.

2133,[],Mirrormn,,,[],,,,text,t2_4acxm,False,,"&gt;My point here is that these additive taxes crush people quickly.

Sometimes I get the feeling that people just cobble together an argument with whatever scraps of thoughts they can find in their minds, without even considering at all whether the thoughts actually fit together at all. They just have a goal to reach a certain conclusion, and need to put some stuff in the middle to get there, doesn't matter what.

I get that distinct impression from your post.

First of all, you're adding up taxes with things that are not taxes *at all*. I can even begin to think of why. Shelter, food, and water aren't taxes! Not content with adding your entire budget together while trying to talk about taxes, you also just fabricate expenses like ""I can't not save"".

Second of all, if you're putting 20% of your pre-tax income into savings, you are *not* being crushed. ""Crushed"" means you're trying to figure out how to not overdraw your bank account in order to eat dinner, or you're moving back in with your parents because you can't afford your rent, or you're trying to find someone to buy your PS3 so you can have some spending money. (And even those options probably seem privileged to some people). ""Crushed"" does not mean ""My life is fine right now, but I don't have enough capital to construct an underground bunker or invest $50,000 in a get-rich cryptocurrency scheme or buy a better car than that asshole I hate at work and that's the government's fault.""

Thirdly, you're supposed to be talking about regressive taxes, right? So why did you include an aside about how your ""savings are taxed when you die"", which I assume is talking about estate tax, which is one of the most *progressive* taxes there is (only applies to estates above $11.4m). And how does a tax that only applies at the end of your life have anything to do with you being ""crushed"" by taxes on a day-to-day level? It's something that literally can't apply to you in the general course of living your life and budgeting your finances.

Fourth, a lot of your numbers seem totally inaccurate in the first place. You're spending 9% of your pre-tax income on gas? If you're in a tax bracket where your total tax burden is 32%, I highly doubt it. Average Americans only spent $700-$1300 on gas per year in 2016. (And only a fraction of that goes to taxes.)

I really don't see what your intention was in all this. Just to say that regressive taxes suck because people tend to spend all of their money, and all spending is taxed? You don't need to provide an example budget for that, since the point works in the abstract. And even then, including the weird 20% savings piece in there just confuses or even contradicts your point. It makes no sense to me.",1568859576,{},f0qgqh5,False,t3_d5ztyi,False,True,t1_f0q2rr9,/r/politics/comments/d5ztyi/sanders_unveils_25_trillion_housing_for_all_plan/f0qgqh5/,1568859665.0,1,True,[],False,politics,t5_2cneq,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adding a wealth tax will just lead to the rich people moving their assets to avoid taxation. And unless the rest of the world is going to cooperate with IRS investigators, that avoidance will work.

Clearly the branches of government we have now can be corrupted, and if the founders weren't perfect then we shouldn't have to be perfect to pick up their mantle and bring this country to the modern day.

In the past the United States has been protected by our government's slow-moving mechanics, but today that inefficiency comes at the cost of not being able to react in time to meet the demands of the Information Age. The press is reactive and in the perfect position to mediate between the political world and the common citizen.

To me, the most important measure of a final proposal to add another branch - and for the result of any major amendment, really - is that it stands equally in the system of checks and balances. If it is too weak, it will eventually be used to subvert the populace. If it is too strong, it introduces a new and exploitable weakness to the security of our government. Given the stability that our current system has proven, right now I would argue erring towards weakness would be favorable than towards strength. We shouldn't - and don't need to - give up the benefits of a slow-moving system in order to also gain those of a more responsive government.

I've also given it some thought, and I think that we need to stop treating the Constitution like Christians treat the Bible: The era of prophets may be over, but the era of philosopher-politicians still has a long way to go. We need to adapt, like all living organisms do, and rise to the challenges of our time. 

We need to accept still-ambiguous concepts like cryptocurrency and post-nationalism, because technology has destroyed traditional methods of censorship. Regulation and even prohibition don't necessarily need to be off the table, but abstinence-only education doesn't work and likewise trying to hide information from your citizenry that is open knowledge in another nation is not going to work in a world interconnected at the speed of light. 

America needs to be able to take pride not just in having freedom of speech, but in open and brazen sponsorship of speech and all other communication that will help us to excel and perservere. Our society is encumbered by so many perhaps interesting but ultimately pointless debates - what's the celebrity faux pas of the week? - and yet nowhere are we using the collective power of the people to promote forums for the discussion of the topics like climate change that actually matter. Scientists and even the U.S. military have petitioned our leaders to address such threats, but they act like the only way to be granted the power to do anything is to have their party elected as a supermajority. Our election cycle is too slow for that to be a satisfactory rate of decision-making.

We have the current need as a nation to react to events more quickly and we deserve the right to adjust our government to do so. I think the real issue holding us back, though, is that we as a country can't agree to accept responsibility for our collective actions and their consequences. No president can act before being elected, and no voter is living in isolation from society. We need to facilitate discourse amongst discourse and a formalized branch to report on the pertinent topics would be a huge boon.

The ultra-rich among both the GOP and DNC are terrified of Warren and Sanders actually making them play fair. The GOP probably doesn't care much about Trump losing, since part of their natural cycle is to make a huge mess and then vulture off of it while impeding Democrats from cleaning it up too quickly, and Trump and Friends did 8 years worth of damage easy. I think the Ukraine ""dig"" is that they know the Biden family has already greatly enriched themselves in Ukraine (a good deal of which happened while Biden was VP, normalizing that ""High-ups just get rich when they get elected, nothing to see here!"" mindset) and Hunter was there.. and Hunter loves drugs and has no morals (and I suspect the same about Uncle Joe, overall). The GOP suspects defeat no matter what, but wouldn't it be nice to lure Biden on stage on purpose and then *really* hit him with dirt that isn't public yet. Which is another thing about Joe Biden: I didn't need Ukraine at all to find more than enough reasons not to vote for him.

* Joe Biden's tragic family Jerry Springer tale (its a doozy), his dogwhistling-level ""accidental racist"" remarks, the Ukraine dealings themselves, the lack of an endorsement from Obama..

The point is, *why*? Why should I stop smearing this guy as thinly as I can get him? Are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren this catastrophically wounded? Because I've asked angry Twitter mobs to ""give me all they've got"" as far as dirt on them goes, and I got back that Elizabeth Warren ""used to be a Republican!!"".. and when researched yes, she wanted to govern from an economic angle *with humanity in mind* and eventually found out the GOP has no real interest in humanity, so she became a Democrat and *stayed* a Dem. Look at Trump's flip-flopping between parties to see what a red flag on that field looks like.

Fox News would *love* to dig into the things I listed above, and in great detail, holding *us* accountable in a way they never held Trump or the GOP, as they always do, and I won't spend 4 to 8 years of my life defending Biden and his family when other options exist.

We're supposed to be the ones that investigate our candidates, that don't allow ""the older Dems"" to be so ignorant as to support Joe Biden. *Tell them*, and if they bray in your face like a jackass and should ""I LOVE JOE BIDEN ANYWAY! I don't care if his son is invested in Chinese facial recognition oppression technology!"", then they're probably 1. not a Democrat and 2. not who you thought they were all this time? Dunno. My family listened to me and became instantly anti-Biden.

*Anyway*, I'm wondering if the deal in Ukraine isn't the GOP trying to dig up some truly disgusting dirt on Biden (which is difficult, after the things I listed above, but clearly not possible). Biden winning wouldn't be 100% fun for the GOP, but he's already promised not to ""shake things up"" with the ultra-wealthy, he's already shown his opinion is up for sale if you have the cash, and he's already shown that he likes a good grope and light racism, so how bad could it be? The only thing *better* would be to hammer Uncle Joe over the head with something infinitely more damning right at the finish line, in hopes that *just maybe* they can align the forces of gerrymandering *and* bribing *and* foreign aid *and* Joe Biden's unnatural level of moral wounds to potentially get another 4 years of outright feasting under Mango Mussolini.

Washington, the fucking first iteration, president 1.0, before the updates (lol) was such a fucking intellectual giant.  Jefferson? I fucking suck balls at life compared to that man.

Tempted to paste a few quotes, I'll resist for sake of staying on topic.  Look, almost no one on the left is trying to ""take away"" your right to bear arms.  Times are completely different.  A militia does not amount to what it did.  The concept may be preserved,  but it had much to do with maintaining the order of our government the way it functions for the people... or else (you know?)

This is not something a militia can regulate.  Our forefathers did not foresee future tech. The military means a very different thing than it did back then.  They didn't say anything about us ""inevitably"" flying,  let alone developing space tech and satellites and facial recognition, deep fakes, cyber warfare, laser anti air guns, nuclear weapons,  stealth technology etc. and the list goes on for far too long that I can spare here. 

They understood the nature of human beings.  So they could account for extreme partisanship and greed and wealth distribution.  These things were within their toolkit of prediction.  Bearing arms means today, something alien back then.  They had much to say about us as people in a fundamental way. And we should protect what they built.  

But realistically,  they wrote some things without knowing how the story was going to unfold. So yes,  the constitution must evolve to stay current. It must be able to adapt for things they never could have dreamt possible.  Just as we must to the same. 

Keep your guns.  Just regulate the ""well regulated"" militia a bit.  Don't allow yourself to be conned by those that would call for teachers to be armed simply because that's a whole new demographic of potential buyers.  Take pause when people that stand to gain peddle policies that would grant them exactly that.  Likewise, take equal caution over those that oppose policies that will hurt their quarterly earnings.  

No one is taking away your guns,  even when the point of keeping them 250 years ago has become moot.  You like guns.  You maybe like hunting.  You want to feel protected.  Ok fine.  Keep the guns.

Eliminate offshore tax scams through the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act.
Tax Wall Street speculators through the Inclusive Prosperity Act.
Scrap the income cap on Social Security payroll taxes through the Social Security Expansion Act so that millionaires and billionaires pay more into the system.
End special tax breaks on capital gains and dividends for the top 1%.

Close tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy and large corporations.

Bernie on criminal justice reform:

Ban for-profit prisons.
Make prison phone calls and other communications such as video chats free of charge.
Audit the practices of commissaries and use regulatory authority to end price gouging and exorbitant fees.
Incentivize states and localities to end police departments’ reliance on fines and fees for revenue.
Remove the profit motive from our re-entry system and diversion, community supervision, or treatment programs, and ensure people leaving incarceration or participating in diversion, community supervision, or treatment programs can do so free of charge.
End the use of secured bonds in federal criminal proceedings.
Provide grants to states to reduce their pretrial detention populations, which are particularly high at the county level, and require states to report on outcomes as a condition of renewing their funding.
Withhold funding from states that continue the use of cash bail systems.
Ensure that alternatives to cash bail are not leading to disparities in the system.

Rescind former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ guidance on consent decrees.
Revitalize the use of Department of Justice investigations, consent decrees, and federal lawsuits to address systemic constitutional violations by police departments.
Ensure accountability, strict guidelines and independent oversight for all federal funds used by police departments.
End federal programs that provide military equipment to local police forces.
Create a federally managed database of police use of deadly force.
Provide grants for states and cities to establish civilian oversight agencies with enforceable accountability mechanisms.
Establish federal standards for the use of body cameras, including establishing third-party agencies to oversee the storage and release of police videos.
Mandate criminal liability for civil rights violations resulting from police misconduct.
Limit the use of “qualified immunity” to address the lack of criminal liability for civil rights violations resulting from police misconduct.
Conduct a U.S. Attorney General's investigation whenever someone is killed in police custody.
Establish a federal no-call policy, including a registry of disreputable federal law enforcement officers, so testimony from untrustworthy sources does not lead to criminal convictions. Provide financial support to pilot local and state level no-call lists.
Ban the use of facial recognition software for policing.

Establish national standards for use of force by police that emphasize de-escalation.
Require and fund police officer training on implicit bias (to include biases based on race, gender, sexual orientation and identity, religion, ethnicity and class), cultural competency, de-escalation, crisis intervention, adolescent development, and how to interact with people with mental and physical disabilities. We will ensure that training is conducted in a meaningful way with strict independent oversight and enforceable guidelines.
Ban the practice of any law enforcement agency benefiting from civil asset forfeiture. Limit or eliminate federal criminal justice funding for any state or locality that does not comply.
Provide funding to states and municipalities to create civilian corps of unarmed first responders, such as social workers, EMTs, and trained mental health professionals, who can handle order maintenance violations, mental health emergencies, and low-level conflicts outside the criminal justice system, freeing police officers to concentrate on the most serious crimes.
Incentivize access to counseling and mental health services for officers.
Diversify police forces and academies and incentivize officers to live and work in the communities they serve.

Triple congressional spending on indigent defense, to $14 billion annually.
After a review of current salaries and workload, set a minimum starting salary for all public defenders.
Create and set a national formula to assure populations have a minimum number of public defenders to assure full access to constitutional right to due process.
Establish federal guidelines and goals for a right to counsel, including policies that reduce the number of cases overall.
Create a federal agency to provide support and oversight for state public defense services.
Authorize the Department of Justice to take legal action against jurisdictions that are not meeting their Sixth Amendment obligations.
Cancel all existing student debt and cancel any future student debt for public defenders through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.

Appoint an Attorney General committed to public safety and creating a more just and humane criminal justice system.
Limit “absolute immunity” for prosecutors, which is used to shield wrongdoers from liability.
End the practice of jailing material witnesses.
Place a moratorium on the use of the algorithmic risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system until an audit is completed. We must ensure these tools do not have any implicit biases that lead to unjust or excessive sentences.
Abolish the death penalty.
Reverse the Trump administration’s guidance on the use of death penalty drugs with the goal of ending the death penalty at the state level.
Stop excessive sentencing with the goal of cutting the incarcerated population in half.
End mandatory sentencing minimums.
Reinstate a federal parole system and end truth-in-sentencing. People serving long sentences will undergo a “second look” process to make sure their sentence is still appropriate.
End “three strikes” laws. No one should spend their life behind bars for committing minor crimes, even if they commit several of them.
Invigorate and expand the compassionate release process so that people with disabilities, the sick and elderly are transitioned out of incarceration whenever possible.
Expand the use of sentencing alternatives, including community supervision and publicly funded halfway houses. This includes funding state-based pilot programs to establish alternatives to incarceration, including models based on restorative justice and free access to treatment and social services.
Revitalize the executive clemency process by creating an independent clemency board removed from the Department of Justice and placed in White House.
Stop the criminalization of homelessness and spend nearly $32 billion over five years to end homelessness. This includes doubling McKinney-Vento homelessness assistance grants to build permanent supportive housing, and $500 million to provide outreach to homeless people to help connect them to available services. In the first year of this plan, 25,000 Housing Trust Fund units will be prioritized for housing the homeless.
Legalize marijuana and vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions, and ensure that revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in communities hit hardest by the War on Drugs.
Provide people struggling with addiction with the health care they need by guaranteeing health care — including inpatient and outpatient substance abuse and mental health services with no copayments or deductibles — to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program.
Decriminalize possession of buprenorphine, which helps to treat opioid addiction, and ensure that first responders carry naloxone to prevent overdoses.
Legalize safe injection sites and needle exchanges around the country, and support pilot programs for supervised injection sites, which have shown to substantially reduce drug overdose deaths.
Raise the threshold for when drug charges are federalized, as federal charges carry longer sentences.

So, the first question is really ""what do you want to see happen with your donation?"" Also, ""are you looking to back a smaller, niche charity or do you want to be part of a larger effort?"" 


Take your answers to both of these and start looking around. Check in articles and posts about the sort of change you want to be part of: who is there? What organizations seem like they're doing what you want to support? 


While sites like Charity Navigator are super helpful, they're pretty restricted by what their algorithms can do with the forms non-profits submit to the IRS (and whether a charity has the money/manpower to manage their online presence). There are a lot of good causes that don't even think to make sure their profile is presentable. 


I know a lot of people talk about ""administrative costs"" but those are generally necessary in larger organizations with a lot of logistics or even as part of their cause like running a museum (having experience in that world in particular, I can tell you that most of the administrative team will at least play a supporting role in making things run, even if they're not strictly part of the ""program budget"" ). Curating is *weird*. 


And don't be surprised if a charity seems to spend a lot on fundraising - we do run on donations and arranging gifts (particularly the big ones) tends to involve a *lot* of work, sometimes for *years*. You generally don't just have some wealthy donor walk up with a million dollar check and there's a lot of competition from other very worthy causes for those donors.

Snes is the king of this. There are games that still hold up that I can still play and enjoy. What really sells it for me, besides how the graohicnand tech limits were pushed then, is the sound.

Megaman X, Super Metroid, F-zero, battleships and many more examples all have fantastic sound design that probably gets lost now that we have compression algorithms in processing them vs. The sound and graphics hard coded into a chip.

There are many gameboy advance games that still hold up, Zelda, megaman battle network, fire emblem, metroid fusion. And although they have a diminished sound quality by virtue of the gameboy, they still hold up very well both graphically and gameplay wise.

Id say compare the snes and then sega genesis, I feel the genesis had games that did not age so well, sonic is an exception while also being an example of how timeless a stylistic choice can be, and the importance of stylistic consistency.

In psychologist, there was an experiment done to determine is chimpanzees had self-awareness. As I recall, there was a mirror in the chimp's quarters, and after a while the chimp didn't treat the reflection as another chimp. But the experimenters sedated the chimpanzee and put a red dye on top of its head, where it couldn't see it; when the chimp next saw itself in the mirror, it touched its own head, instead of the reflection's, which seemed a pretty good example that the chimp understood the reflection to be itself.

But how do you do this with an AI? Or, more specifically, if an AI can pass the Turing test, does that mean it has consciousness? Or is it just a good set of IF/THEN statements?

We could say that, since the human brain has neural interconnections, if we could somehow develop an artificial intelligence program that could match that number of relationships then we might be close, from a capacity point of view. [The human brain has 100 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/100-trillion-connections/) We are likely far away from matching that.

In addition, even if we could mimic the processing in software, we might not imbue that data with *meaning*. There was a common program written in BASIC about fifty years ago, called Eliza. You would get an initial prompt, like, ""Hi! I'm Eliza. How are you?"" and then could type whatever you wanted. Some people would get into very personal information while interacting with Eliza, because the program seemed to be responding to what they said. But all it was doing was looking for keywords and using canned responses.

The film loses that core element of the narrative's thesis on the nature of intelligence, and moreover, the perception of intelligence and misjudgements thereof.

I'm not sure it's fair to portray the novel as a novelization of the film. It's my understanding that Clarke (it's Clarke, by the by, not Clark) wrote that alongside the screenplay, with the intent that they are effectively companion pieces to one another, not that the novel is somehow derived from the screenplay or film. Given the Saturn/Jupiter discrepancy was only really caused by production issues, they are, really, not merely telling similar stories, but instead portraying the same narrative.

And again, I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's a highly experimental film, both in regards to the visual effects (obviously), but also in relation to how it performs storytelling. The lack of exposition, being a key experiment here, hasn't had a lack of influence either. I'd say it's heavily reflected in a lot of art-house films since.

This can lead to oddities like nets coming to bizarre conclusions like ""most black pixels in this image have a dark brown pixel to the right of them, thus the image must show a lion"", which happened to be true for every single lion picture in the training set but is obviously not a good way of identifying a lion. And we have no idea that that's how the network thinks until it starts misclassifying lions and we spend time figuring out why.

2222,[],Aquatico_,,,[],,,,text,t2_13uop7,False,,"I appreciate the thoughtful reply. The argument that humans' apparent free will and consciousness distinguishes us from life which came about by pure chance is a pretty good one, as we currently have no way of explaining it. However this is my take on it. Even if you were given infinite time and resources, it would be impossible to explain pain to a sheep. You could go on about nociceptors and nerves as much as you want, but the sheep would never understand. While the sheep can feel pain, it lacks the mental wherewithal to understand the concept. This is how I feel about humans and consciousness. We have the neuronal complexity to experience it, but we lack the ability to understand the mechanisms which control it, just like the sheep. Just because we do not (and maybe cannot) understand it, that doesn't mean it isn't governed by purely mechanical processes. 

&gt; Mold cannot ponder its own existence. No software, however complex, can really philosophize about the meaning of life. As far as I can tell, there is an unbridgeable gap between mold and human beings.

I disagree with this point. I do not think we are experienced enough as a species to conclude this. Personally, I believe that developments in artificial intelligence will show us that an appropriately complex and self-correcting system will eventually have the ability to transcend to more than the sum of its parts, and will be able to experience consciousness on some level. I find it difficult to believe that the universe is not just complex chemical and mechanical processes, though I appreciate that others may disagree.",1569364456,{},f1cs2sc,False,t3_d8gox4,False,True,t1_f1cqjcd,/r/AskReddit/comments/d8gox4/religious_people_of_reddit_what_convinces_you_the/f1cs2sc/,1569364456.0,1,True,[],False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2260,[],M0dusPwnens,,,[],,,,text,t2_8s4ye,False,[],"I would rather use both like we do right now, but maybe with a little more everyday familiarity with both. I've lived with both and am fluent in both in everyday life (although I only ever used metric for science when I was a researcher, regardless of where I was).

Metric makes more sense for all scientific measurements, engineering, etc. It simplifies the math a lot when you're dealing with multiple different quantities like trying to figure out the volume of some mass.

But a lot of Imperial measures actually make more sense for everyday uses. And you don't really need a simple volume to mass ratio in everyday life.

A centimeter is useful, like an inch, and a meter is useful, like a yard, and for km or mile they're both pretty equally useful, but the foot is super useful too, and you see all sorts of everyday measurements that are given with large numbers that imply precision that isn't really there, where a foot would be useful. Like ""it's, I dunno, about two feet long"" is more natural than ""it's, I dunno, about 60 cm long?"". It's not a huge deal, but there's a reason that no one really uses the decimeter - it makes sense to have an intermediate measurement, but  multiples of 10 don't actually work out to useful increments in everyday life. There's a reason that you hear ""foot"" constantly in the imperial system and almost never hear casual usage of decimeter.

Volume is similar - maybe even worse. You just use these gigantic ml numbers, much more rarely centiliter or deciliter. The units are easy to convert between, but instead of using the multiple of 10 that makes the number smallest, everyone typically just treats increments like 50 ml as de facto units.

Which is how the metric system ends up working in everyday life in general - instead of having seemingly arbitrary, but actually pretty useful units like the Imperial system, you just end up substituting de facto units made by treating 10, 25, 50 etc. increments as units. Which is also awkward when trying to imply a level of precision - if you say ""about 2 feet"", I have a pretty good idea of the level of precision, and it contrasts clearly with saying ""about 24 inches"", but if you say ""about 60 centimeters"", I don't know if you're saying it's +-10 cm or +-1 cm. Occasionally I've heard people purposefully misreport things to avoid that problem, saying 59 or 61 to imply precision, ironically requiring them to be less precise.

And temperature is probably the big one. Celsius is incredibly silly for reporting outdoor temperature, which is the main thing people need a sense of temperature for.

Cooking is the other everyday use of temperature, but that's almost always because you're setting or reading a temperature - any scale would do because you don't need a sense for what a 200 degrees Celsius oven feels like.

And for outdoor temperatures, Fahrenheit makes way more sense. Ironically for a system all about increments of base 10, Celsius compresses nearly all outdoor temperatures into a tiny range far less than. 100, and a lot of common temperatures go negative, while Fahrenheit represents the vast majority of outdoor temperatures as between about 0 and 100. Likewise, the size of each increment with Celsius degrees (and smaller units are never used - no one reports weather in any kind of decidegrees) is too large, as evidenced by how common it is to see at least one decimal place included in weather reports.  It's a lot less common to see Fahrenheit given with an additional decimal place.

Admittedly, the Fahrenheit scale is large enough that it has the same issue as cm, ml, etc. in that it ends up with de facto units made of 5 and 10 degree increments, but ml and cm don't have Fahrenheit's ironic advantage of fitting useful everyday values into an approximately centigrade scale.

The Imperial units have an arbitrary basis, but there's some sort of genetic fallacy going on when people mock the arbitrary basis. Having an arbitrary basis doesn't make them less useful. In fact, it makes them more useful than bases like the metric system relies on - they evolved naturally through use, and the units that provided useful increments were the ones that survived. Meanwhile, the metric units have a more ""rational"" basis, but not one that has anything to do with the everyday uses of those quantities.

Both are good.

Imperial is better for most everyday uses, but requires remembering a handful of conversions, most of which are pretty easy to remember (although the volume ones get tricky). It requires learning another set of units to do scientific work, but that's fine since you need relatively little actual sense for units when doing that kind of work (1064 C is the melting point for gold and knowing what 20 C feels like outside doesn't really change your understanding of that).

Metric has the advantage of only having to learn one system and not having to remember a handful of conversions. It wouldn't be the end of the world if we switched to metric.

I believe that, if a one-to-one replica of a brain was built, that would be, for all intents and purposes, an intelligent being. To say otherwise is to believe in the existence of something other than arrangement of particles that allows life to form consciousness. Whether that thing is God, a soul or maybe the belief that consciousness can only exist as a side effect of biology is a bit too much to argue for this topic. If you disagree with me on this particular point, then just accept this entire post as the fantastical ravings of a madman, and enjoy it as an interesting perspective that you don't need to accept.

* **A seemingly accurate representation of the world is a simulation that does not need to replicate everything, just enough such that humans are convinced.** This is just a definition for my next set up. 

* **Computational power's theoretical limit is great enough such that a civilization could feasibly run a seemingly accurate representation of the world if the civilization was sufficiently advanced.** This argument is solid for me, but I'm inviting people to tell me I'm wrong, as my understanding of quantum computing is elementary if you're being really generous with the words ""understanding"" and ""elementary.""

* **It is possible for a civilization to exist such that they can build the necessary computers.** Let's all hope we can go post-human. Let's get going on those dyson spheres.

* **Such a civilization would be interested in running that simulation.** The biggest issue of the idea, astronomically large, posthuman science projects probably have astronomically large, post-human costs. Honestly, if I were a post-human civilization, I'd rather reallocate those resources to building more dyson spheres. Never have enough dyson spheres.
---

If you assume all of the above is true, then you are left with the idea that, it is **possible** that what we know as the universe is a simulation. You can, of course argue against the premises.

Maybe consciousness really does exist as a side effect of biology. Maybe a simulation *does* need to replicate everything in the world. Perhaps Moore's ~~Law~~ ~~Theory~~ ~~Hypothesis~~ Guess doesn't take computational power far enough to simulate a world. Maybe civilizations are prone to destroying themselves before they reach post-human. Maybe no one's willing to front the costs of a world simulation project because they're too busy building dyson spheres.

But if you accept those premises to be true, then it is possible that we are living in a simulation. If you add in one more premise, a personal favourite of mine, that a simulation can run its own simulation, you reach an even more insane conclusion: The chance of us living in a simulation is basically 1.",1568993051,{},f0vvvm4,False,t3_d6s1ut,False,True,t3_d6s1ut,/r/AskReddit/comments/d6s1ut/people_of_reddit_what_are_your_arguments_about/f0vvvm4/,1568993053.0,1,True,[],False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2323,[],Hotdropper,,,[],,,,text,t2_epym2,False,,"INFO: does it affect everyone or just me?

For years I’ve said I need another day every week that nobody else gets.

If it happened to everyone, the status quo would probably just be maintained. Queue employers saying the standard work day is now 12 hours and other crap like that.

If it was just me, omg, I’d be in heaven. I’d have the time to write the tools I need to do all of the programmery things I love to do. Time to stay current on the changes in tech so I don’t always feel like I’m stuck playing catch-up. 

Eventually that would mean I could then make time to work on all of my fun side projects.

One of the ideas rolling around in my head has been making an album full of music like Weird Al, but all of the lyrics would be poignant commentary on the life of workers within and around IT. I want to do this both because it sounds fun as hell, and because there’s a part of me that hopes it could help combat the all too frequently experienced inter relation issues we see: the brogramming culture, the impostor syndrome, and the like. It’d be fun to do a couple in ballad style that while being funny and pleasant to listen to, through the story showed how to navigate difficult situations with coworkers and management.

Another idea I’ve had is that I want to play with OpenAI and see if I can’t get the critters to learn to communicate. Give them speak(tone, volume, duration) and a listener, hunger, and the ability to eat. Drop two of them in two side by side “wire like” cages (sound can go through but they are still isolated). Each cage has 3 buttons and 3 displays that light up, and a good dispenser. The buttons in cage A control the food dispenser in cage B. The buttons must be pressed in a particular randomly generated sequence to trigger food being released. The displays in each cage communicate the next button to press to release food in that cage. 

It would probably take a few different cycles to get going...

So to start, for Critter A to get food, he’d have to get critter B to press any button. Once they can manage that, then A needs to get B to press any button, then the display in cage A would light up with the next button Critter B needed to press, and A will have to get B to do it.

That sounds really fun to try doing but I’ve never messed with ANY AI or deep learning stuff.

Then I’d learn how to write code against quantum computing resources, so that I could incorporate that into the AI stuff I was doing, as at this point I don’t believe we will make the leap over the gap between human and computer reasoning until that is accomplished and well understood, as the lab studies into paranormal effects all seem to really boil down to suggesting that there are larger quantum events that can occur and impact us.

I suspect once I hit the point of playing with OpenAI that I’d spend more time doing frivolous fun things as well... gaming and the like. It’s just hard to take time away from accomplishing meaningful things like building an app for my girlfriend to do something like play a video game.
