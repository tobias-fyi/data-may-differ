11,[],Imperator_Helvetica,,,[],,,,text,t2_p7hxv,False,"My first thought was *Wild Wood* by Jan Needle - it's a telling of the Wind in the Willows from the point of view of the Weasels - their socialist overthrow of the corrupt Mr Toad and bourgeoise gentry of Badger, Mole and Rat. Making *Wind in the Willows* the 'protecting the status quo and British class system' novel.

As for books which support totalitarianism. I fear, as u/Meatballsmothman said, there are those who read the same books, but take the wrong message - or just the 'this would be great, if it was **us** in charge and it was our enemies being punished...'

“Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence.” - Orwell

Sometimes people support dictatorships our of fear or ignorance, or that the world is so troubled it requires a strong hand and the suspension of their liberties - either to abrogate their responsibilities 'It isn't me running the death camps, I just tacitly support them...' or that the Authorities are superior - chosen by God, aristocratic blood or their inherent superiority.

“The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.” - Orwell.

It has been argued that superheroes are inherently fascistic - one strong super-moral arbeiter able to enforce that will - but comics like Superman were written by Jewish emigres  as a power fantasy and the original Superman supported social justice - taking on corrupt landlords, nazis, the KKK etc. Not the aryan ubermensch, but a guy representing the best of us.

Some sci-fi leans towards the totalitarian - Heinlein's *Starship Troopers* \- though a satire, was taken seriously enough that some embrace the 'No citizenship without service' ideology and it's in the extraordinary situation of War with Alien invaders. Much like revolutionaries who become totalitarians declare 'Free elections will come after the current crisis is resolved.'

Another satire is the Warhammer Universe - the fascistic militarism, religious mania and surveillance are almost the only sane reaction to a universe full of literal real demons, shapechangers and alien monsters who cannot be negotiated with. The British comic strip *Judge Dredd* could be said to do the same (though it again, was a satire of the US 'Bad Cop' films of the 80s - like *Dirty Harry*.)

At the other end of the political spectrum is Iain M Banks' Culture series - set in a post scarcity machine led utopia where everyone is free.  The Culture has been criticised as having immense personal freedoms, but little way in which to influence the system. Individual property and money is a difficult concept for Culture residents - if everything can be created and replicated then how does one 'own' anything. In *Player of Games*, the Culture is contrasted with the Empire of Azad - where totalitarian capitalism is the only thing shoring up the Empire against insidious infiltration/corruption from Alien busybodies. Much like how states like North Korea react to Western democratic interference.

*Shades of Grey* by Jasper Fforde is a quirky dystopian novel which presents a society in which individual rights are surrendered for the 'common good' and how sensible that appears on the surface - even if various books, machines and ideas are censored to prevent disharmony.

Some of the Futurists of the Early Twentieth Century supported Militarism and Fascism (and Eugenics) as an alternative to the class/monarchies - but many recanted after seeing the results of mechanical slaughter/warfare in the Great War and the horrors of the Second World War.

Colonial fiction might be of interest to you - [The White Man's Burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden) by Kipling is an Imperialist appeal for Empire to invade 'inferior nations.' Like Manifest Destiny. You'll probably want to read lots of dead white British Imperialists, but they were challenged even in their lifetimes and have only become more unpopular.

Finding novels which support totalitarianism might be difficult - totalitarianism and authoritarian regimes tend to treat novelists poorly - Control of the present means control of the past (We have always been at war with Eurasia!) and control of the future (to paraphrase Orwell again.) You'll probably find a lot which support the status quo, or are revolutionary texts - albeit for a revolution to replace the current system with their own - *Mein Kampf, Turner Diaries, Unabomber Manifesto* etc.

Ayn Rand maybe - she wasn't a totalitarian though, even if her philosophy supports enslavement. You can be oppressed by a rugged individualist rather than government!

Marxism pushed for a dictatorship of the proletariat where governmental forces would seize means of production to later be distributed to the people (which happened a lot more in theory than in practice). This was considered an essential stage in the process of reaching full ""true"" communism.

Now of course, to achieve this dictatorship, one requires a few things:

1. A strong central government with a monopoly on violence to seize these means of production,
2. A strong head of government to oversee this redistribution,
3. Some method of overthrowing the old government (who presumably would like to keep their position), and
4. Some method of overcoming the influence and control of the ""bourgeoisie"" (who presumably would like to keep their stuff).

This means that a dictatorship and it's supporters could justify a strong government with a tyrannical dictator, as a man ""leading the vanguard of the revolution through whatever (violent) means necessary.""

That's why so many different dictators are, or claim to be, socialists, from Hitler and the Nazis, to Stalin and the CCCP, to Hussein and the Ba'athists.

Mao's book and Mein Kampf do sort of the same thing, they push for this grander world if only certain things be changed (more devotion to the leader, or elimination of pesky bad groups).

He finds himself in the same location (Boston, Massachusetts), but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000, and while he was sleeping, the United States has been transformed into a socialist utopia. The remainder of the book outlines Bellamy's thoughts about improving the future. The major themes include problems associated with capitalism, a proposed socialist solution of a nationalization of all industry, and the use of an ""industrial army"" to organize production and distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions.

What an asshole she was. PERFECT fit for a juvenile hall prison guard. Which was one of her previous jobs, she told us once. REALLY should not have been in charge of fragile middle schoolers. I truly hope she's dead by now so she can't hurt anyone else like me.

I was cleared to move into the regular LA-Reading class about halfway through the school year, after my parents contacted the principal after I told them about the insane crap she'd said, and this was the first book I read with them. It's not amazing by any means, not original, not award-winning. Just another cheap paperback of about 140 pages, the type you might pick up at a Scholastic book fair. But it struck a chord with me. 

At the risk of spoiling its main plot twist, the characters, a group of 10 teens, graduate school and then are immediately  forced into an unemployment slum in this dystopian future, (Because labor automation from robots), and they have to scrounge, thrift, DIY, and straight-up steal to make a habitable location for themselves in the slums. Then the Big Plot happens and they have to start over again, from the literal Stone Age, weaving fishing lures out of the brushed-out hair of their resident artist, smelting their own bronze and iron, firing their own clay pots. The last chapter of the book has the protagonist sitting down with her pet project, a handmade book, and she begins to write the first sentence of the book, as though this whole novel has been her autobiography.

This book introduced me to the idea that, after school, I might be forcibly unemployed (which, big surprise, actually happened to me because disability) but that I could still DO things. 

That my specialization might in fact be valuable to a group - they had a historian, a geologist, a woodworker-musician, a psychologist, a hunter, all of whom were more than one-dimensional stereotypes. (Not MUCH more than one-dimensional, but there were 10 of them, and it was a short novel.) 

That you have NO IDEA how far from home you might wind up in the course of your life, but that the things you did in The Before Time can and will support you through it.

Also introduced me to the idea of developing a 'robust post-apocalyptic skill set.' I'm pretty sure it was after that year that I got into sewing and darning. Had to stop eventually, because disability, but I do have that skill to fall back on if it's ever REALLY needed. 

I try to re-read it once a year to see if I can get anything else out of it as I age.

“I mean the Century War with Islam,” interrupted the Time Traveler. “Your future. Everyone’s.” He was no longer smiling. Without asking, or offering to pour me any, he stood, refilled his Scotch glass, and sat again. He said, “It was important to me to come back to this time early on in the struggle. Even if only to remind myself of how unspeakably blind you all were.” &lt;

It delves into the nitty gritty and shows the flaws of what is supposed to be a sort of utopia. *Island* is more of an outline for a healthy society that Huxley envisioned. Though he acknowledges its flaws, there are many more that Huxley doesn't acknowledge due to his biases as a writer and thinker. I will do my best to explain it, but keep in mind that I am somewhat skeptical of his ideas as well.

  As far as sex and jealousy goes, polygamy/polyamory isn't in any way enforced. Sex and relationships are basically a free-for-all and the Palanese can have any sort of relationship they wish. Obviously, the Nurse and Ranga would not likely work out if the jealousy persists. Note that there are plenty of monogamous realtionships on the Island as well. The relaxed attitude towards sex and the individual's right to determine their partners stems more from the guiding philosophy in the society; no one is required to abide by it.

  The sameness of all of the Palanese characters is, I think, wholly intentional. Dr. Macphail frequently touches on the fact that the island has essentially taken every imaginable step to eliminate malcontents. While the society is often eerily perfect, I think it is by design. It is a counterpoint to *BNW* , in which malcontents are simply drugged and sexed into oblivion. Here the drugs and sex are supposed to be disciplines in which an individual can grow. Essentially, every part of Palanese life is constructed to nurture some aspect of the individual. Things like the MACs aren't super important to the message; they are more features that an egoless society might create, and not intended to be anything more.
 
  As far as your concern with ""liberty"", this is an area where I didn't know how to interpret Huxley. The Palanese notion of liberty is closer to spiritual notions such as nirvana than anything John Locke would mention. It basically means nothing in Palanese society, because the population has been educated (or indoctrinated, depending on your view) to see that their own society will create both prosperity and fulfillment for them if they simply follow the script. There are no conflicts of interest because everyone has been raised to have the same interest besides Murugan and Rani.

  The emphasis on ""here and now"" is the chief area that you are misreading. It is not materialism or pragmatism, but simply Eastern ""mindfulness"", and it is the lynchpin to the entire society. Rather than thirsting for objects or entertaining the Western notion of the search for meaning, the Palanese derive meaning from their surroundings, their labors, and their friends and partners. The ideal of mindfulness is to be utterly present, and appreciate every detail and aspect of the existence you occupy. Appreciating the way air feels in your lungs, the way the body of your sexual partner feels, the burn of hard labor, all without letting ""Not-You"" (who you think you are) get in the way of it and ruining the experience. Huxley genuinely thought this was the key to killing the human ego, and creating a society like Pala, where the whole contributes to the development of the self.

  For a nation like Pala, the gold standard is an obvious choice. They have created a society without debt and with no internal use for currency, so backing their money with gold will give them impressive buying power abroad. it's actually one of the only ways a nation that small could pursue its economic interests in a more developed world.",1566942767,{},ey9gf6n,False,t3_cw7xje,False,True,t1_ey9bh5v,/r/books/comments/cw7xje/i_need_guidance_on_finishing_island_by_aldous/ey9gf6n/,1566942768,1,True,,False,books,t5_2qh4i,0,,

Traditionally, the left wing vs right wing divide is between republicans (who sat on the left of the french national assembly), and monarchists (who sat on the right). Traditionally, it could be argued that Brave New World in a way is left wing dystopia, but right wing utopia. 

After all, Brave New World is ruled by a benevolent government that eliminated crime, unemployment, and xenophobia. World State delivers everything people could want on a material level. If we look at monarchists, World State is essentially their ideal government.

For republicans however, World State is their nightmare, since it strips away individual agency.

My next planned binge is because Michelle West finished the House Wars series this year, and my turn with the library copy is coming up. Since it's the last book in its series, I plan to read from the beginning again, which will be 16 books (I'm including the other connected series-es, the 2 books of Hunter's Oath and the 6 books of the Sun Sword, along with the 8 books of House Wars). And most of those books are Stormlight Archive-size.

I find that immersing myself in a world suits me. However, because of that, I get picky about what I dive into. It can't be too nasty. And that isn't about the setting, it's about the characters we are asked to sympathize with.

Let's take Marissa Meyer's series, the Lunar Chronicles. I am happy to immerse myself in that one; despite the high amount of political manipulation, violence, and death that occurs in that one, like any other YA dystopia, the viewpoint characters have a pretty good handle on how far they'll go to achieve their goals, generally going almost-but-not-quite up to ""an eye for an eye."" 

But her side story Fairest is very hard for me to read, because the viewpoint character has a very twisted idea of appropriate reactions. She starts off as someone easy to sympathize with, and ends up veering far beyond justifiable actions. 

You're reading Stormlight; I started getting uneasy about Bridge 4 leader-guy's mindset in book 2, and it got difficult to read. But I really liked book 3, despite some rough patches.

84,[],JimFan1,,,[],,,,text,t2_16etf1,False," I've completed ***The Testaments*** by **Atwood**. I've posted similar thoughts before when I was half-way through, but here's a short review.

*The Testaments*, unfortunately, doesn't hold its own quite as well as the original *The Handmaid's Tale.* *The Handmaid's Tale* understood the true horrors of dystopia stem from the notion of 'existence is resistance,' in which the true evil of such society is realized in the destruction of the individual via the loss of autonomy. Protagonists, once aware of their condition, are often unable to bear the so-called tribulations and either choose to conform or, in a final act of defiance, remove themselves from the dystopian society (generally speaking, by either running away or embracing death). In either case, the individual is helpless to alter that which it is a part of. 

*The Testaments* messes this up in more ways than you could imagine to its own detriment. It seems Atwood is tired of the defeatist attitude and pervasive nihilism of this day and age; instead, she chooses to tell a story where her characters actively defy and resist their society. It certainly makes for a fun page-turner/thriller, but because characters actively resist and have agency, it takes away from the Gilead being menacing; more often than not, I found myself disappointed at how incompetent it was. You'll certainly ask yourself: what happened to that to constant fear of getting caught by unseen higher powers found in the original book? Where is the claustrophobia? Who can you trust? It just isn't here.

Worse yet, two of the characters are far, far less compelling than the older one (you'll know who I'm talking about early on) and the twists to the two characters' tale are about as subtle and obvious as mega-bus toppling over while aflame. There were multiple moments that made me sigh in disappointment - whether it was because a scene was written clearly for television, a logical inconsistency, or just general moments that felt like they had to happen rather than being earned. It would have been far better to have just used the older character's perspective as she carries the novel. 

Seems like a lot of complaints, but the book was enjoyable enough...

In the distant past humanity invented AI. AI made better AI. During the Quiet War (which lasted seconds), the AI essentially assumed control of humanity's destiny. For the most part, the AI are benign overlords. Governing humanity is barely an afterthought for them. Early on, AI unlocked interstellar travel and access to unlimited resources guided humanity to a galaxy-spanning utopia. The Polity.

There are a few things that cause strife though.

The Prador are an intelligent alien species of tank sized crabs. They produce thousands of offspring and as a result, have no appreciation for the value of life. Instead of developing AI, they use the excised brains of their own young to power their technology. They fought and lost a terrible war with humanity and now have an uneasy truce/cold war with the Polity.

With medical immortality a fact. Humans can basically be whatever they want. Cyborg bodies, fully artificial bodies, genetically modified organic bodies that can resemble anything they like. Humans have a tendency towards risk-taking behaviour as ennui sets in after a few centuries of life. And the polity does not guarantee their safety when they explore beyond the boundaries of the polity.

The Jain are a long-extinct alien race with a distinctly hostile and alien culture. The Jain might be gone but their technology is lethal enough that it's wiped out entire civilisations in the past when found. Quarantining Jain technology is a major headache for both the Polity and the Prador kingdom.

And finally, there are rogue AI. As much as the AI don't like to admit it. They're imperfect. There's any number of reasons why AI might go rogue, when they do, it's terrifying though. For instance, one famous AI factory was designed to produce better warships. By means of experiment, it's own creators designed it to have material feelings for the warships it produced and the warships were provided with the ability to feel pain, fear etc. The idea was that the warships would become cunning and vicious like beasts.

Unfortunately, the Prador managed to attack the station before it was finished. In desperation, the station was made active during the battle to crank out warships as fast as possible mid-battle. Resulting in a situation where a station AI with maternal feelings was forced to produce warship off spring that kept getting destroyed seconds after leaving the station. It went completely mad. 

Anyway, it's a great setting with a number of trilogies with a focus on various aspects of the setting. I'd start with the Skinner trilogy.

Star Wars is another blend, it is a strong scifi setting (space ships, technology, robots) with a few fantasy elements (the force, jedi knights, lords, queens, princesses, and etc.).

After humanity invented AI, there was the quiet war where AI quickly and peacefully assumed control over humanity. Under the guidance of the AI, the Polity became a utopia spanning many star systems.

In general the AI are effective administrators of humanity. They can be cold and calculating though. For instance during one particular war, AI war strategists sacrificed several billion humans by using them as bait to lure the fleet of a hostile alien race into winning Pyrhic victory. Knowing that the production capacity of the polity would recover their fleet faster than the aliens could recover theirs.

The biggest polity AI can seem nearly godlike. The most powerful amongst them can disassemble a human to their component atoms, read their minds like a book and reassemble them for instance. And the darkest open secret about AI is that they can go insane in rare occasions.

If you read Neil's polity novels in order, AI are mostly a background fact until later in the series when they start taking the lead. If you want to jump ahead (and you can since most trilogies are stand alone), then take a look at *the transformation trilogy.* The trilogy starts with the novel Dark Intelligence and revolves around an insane black AI that acts as a deranged genie.

121,[],Harry-Balsagna,,,[],,,,text,t2_nqsyc,False,"&gt; Much has been written about Star Trek and its politics. That is a left leaning progressive utopia, and transparently so. 

I strongly disagree.   

1) People say the economy is left leaning, but that isn't true at all because this is a post scarcity economy, meaning there is no redistribution of wealth.

2) The government is effectively headed by the spear/shield of their culture, StarFleet, which is organized much like the military with similar military style ranks and uniforms, with an emphasis on law and order.

3) Unlike the leftist free-thinking hippy movement, it espouses a strong government that is extremely hostile to narcotics and homogeneous in culture and fashion, with a promotion of uniforms and uniformity.

4) Starfleet is a complete and total meritocracy.   They have no affirmative-action programs nor promote concepts like victim-class and privilege-class trying to fast-track aliens into positions of power within Starfleet.    We have confirmation of this in the episode in which Picard is given a second chance, and learn that he only has his rank and the extra power and influence that comes with that based on his actions, risk taking, and merit.  

5) Although there can be no useful currency in a post-scarcity economy, the effective currency becomes power and prestige.   There is no socialist attempt at creating equality, only equal opportunity, and those most able achieve the highest positions of power and influence within that structure.  

&gt; For example Lord of The Rings, despite what Tolkein said, is clearly influenced by the two world wars, and especially world war 2.

I always kind of wonder if the folks spouting these sentiments have actually watched more than a couple episodes of *Star Trek*.

*Star Trek* does not present an ""evolved"" humanity, except in the loosest use of the word.  The post-scarcity utopia we see isn't the result of evolution - human beings still need to consume resources to survive - it's the result of technological and sociological growth.  Humans have developed the technology to eliminate scarcity, and they've used it to the betterment of all rather than few.  And, that respect, *Star Trek* is a very positive show.  Very aspirational.  It suggests that we **can** be better.  That we can set aside our greed and hostility and make the world a better place.

But it never presents the darker aspects of humanity as solved.  As gone.  As somehow magically eliminated from the human psyche.

I mean, we've got a genuine post-scarcity utopia.  You can do whatever you want without any need to earn a paycheck.  You can spend all day making art...  Or, more realistically, playing video games and drinking beer.  But for some reason we've got a ton of humans joining Starfleet.  Boldly going into strange, unknown, dangerous situations.  Seeking out conflict.

I've always felt that was at least partly because post-scarcity utopias are boring.  Starfleet gives you a way to raise your social status...  It gives you others to strive against...  In some cases, it gives you others to physically attack.  I've always kind of suspected that if it weren't for Starfleet taking all the people who don't fit into the peace of the Federation, the Federation wouldn't actually **be** peaceful.

But it's a good thing that Starfleet exists, because the Federation is constantly facing external threats.  Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, Borg, Dominion...  No shortage of enemies to shoot at.

And even beyond that - we still see plenty of people who aren't happy with the Federation.  Plenty of people who leave to start their own colonies.

The technology aspect isn’t there, because communism has killed more than all religions combined already.  So the alternative versions seem to be even worse technology wise.

Who wants to read such depressing stuff?

I think this idea is cool, but purely in the realm of FANTASY rather than SF.  
It would be w cool setting for a video game, but ultimately it seems it’s a world no writer really wants to spend mental time on.

Luckily for us, they did that when they hired Michael Chabon as the showrunner.


Here are [his thoughts on Star Trek &amp; Picard](https://www.cnet.com/news/star-trek-discovery-captain-picard-is-the-hero-we-need-says-writer-michael-chabon/):


&gt; To me, dystopia has lost its bite. A, we're living in it, and B, it's such a complete crushing series of cliches at this point. The tropes have all been worked and reworked so many times. There was a period where a positive, optimistic, techno-future where mankind learns to live in harmony and goes out into the stars just to discover and not to conquer, that was an overworked trope. But that is no longer the case. A positive vision of the future articulated through principles of tolerance and egalitarianism and optimism and the quest for scientific knowledge, to me that's feels fresh nowadays.

&gt; Captain Picard is the hero we need right now. He exemplifies in some ways even more then James Kirk -- and I'm not gonna get into the Kirk versus Picard argument because I love Captain Kirk, he was my first captain -- but Picard is even more of an exemplar of everything that is best about Star Trek's vision for the future.",1567547559,{},eyx9145,True,t3_czalq3,False,True,t1_eyx5xz7,/r/scifi/comments/czalq3/star_trek_picard_wraps_production_on_season_1/eyx9145/,1567547572,1,True,[],False,scifi,t5_2qh2z,0,,

1. It is super religious which is fairly uncommon in scifi 

2. The charchters are awful people. There really isn't anyone to cheer on. No one is good. No one is identifiable. This is not a format that is common in fiction in general and as far as I know only happened once in a space opera. Worth mentioning that traditional opera format showing clashes of mighty houses there usually is one good charchter you can cheer on.

3. Partially part of 2 the motivations and planning of the charchters is not something you can picture easily. The Empire and baron set a trap. Paul's dad knows it is a trap and just waltzes into it. The trap is needlessly complicated. The witches have their breeding program. Ok fine. Can you actually imagine being part of an organization that controls your sex life like that? The entire time I was reading it I kept asking myself: when are they going to give up these political religious fights and just settle down raise a family etc. But they don't.

A very common scifi plot is the format: normal person with simple dreams gets casted into an abnormal situation they have to resolve. 

4. They crippled their own tech. Scifi is generally pro-tech. 

5. The Freeman have an unusual spot in the book. They are underdogs but you don't see them except in abstract.

6. It isn't going to get better. It just won't. There is no moment where you see all the scummy awful things they do to each other are going to be a thing of the past. They live in this awful dystopia that is just big enough that it will never die.
