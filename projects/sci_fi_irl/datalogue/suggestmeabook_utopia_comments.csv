11,[],Imperator_Helvetica,,,[],,,,text,t2_p7hxv,False,"My first thought was *Wild Wood* by Jan Needle - it's a telling of the Wind in the Willows from the point of view of the Weasels - their socialist overthrow of the corrupt Mr Toad and bourgeoise gentry of Badger, Mole and Rat. Making *Wind in the Willows* the 'protecting the status quo and British class system' novel.

As for books which support totalitarianism. I fear, as u/Meatballsmothman said, there are those who read the same books, but take the wrong message - or just the 'this would be great, if it was **us** in charge and it was our enemies being punished...'

“Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence.” - Orwell

Sometimes people support dictatorships our of fear or ignorance, or that the world is so troubled it requires a strong hand and the suspension of their liberties - either to abrogate their responsibilities 'It isn't me running the death camps, I just tacitly support them...' or that the Authorities are superior - chosen by God, aristocratic blood or their inherent superiority.

“The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.” - Orwell.

It has been argued that superheroes are inherently fascistic - one strong super-moral arbeiter able to enforce that will - but comics like Superman were written by Jewish emigres  as a power fantasy and the original Superman supported social justice - taking on corrupt landlords, nazis, the KKK etc. Not the aryan ubermensch, but a guy representing the best of us.

Some sci-fi leans towards the totalitarian - Heinlein's *Starship Troopers* \- though a satire, was taken seriously enough that some embrace the 'No citizenship without service' ideology and it's in the extraordinary situation of War with Alien invaders. Much like revolutionaries who become totalitarians declare 'Free elections will come after the current crisis is resolved.'

Another satire is the Warhammer Universe - the fascistic militarism, religious mania and surveillance are almost the only sane reaction to a universe full of literal real demons, shapechangers and alien monsters who cannot be negotiated with. The British comic strip *Judge Dredd* could be said to do the same (though it again, was a satire of the US 'Bad Cop' films of the 80s - like *Dirty Harry*.)

At the other end of the political spectrum is Iain M Banks' Culture series - set in a post scarcity machine led utopia where everyone is free.  The Culture has been criticised as having immense personal freedoms, but little way in which to influence the system. Individual property and money is a difficult concept for Culture residents - if everything can be created and replicated then how does one 'own' anything. In *Player of Games*, the Culture is contrasted with the Empire of Azad - where totalitarian capitalism is the only thing shoring up the Empire against insidious infiltration/corruption from Alien busybodies. Much like how states like North Korea react to Western democratic interference.

*Shades of Grey* by Jasper Fforde is a quirky dystopian novel which presents a society in which individual rights are surrendered for the 'common good' and how sensible that appears on the surface - even if various books, machines and ideas are censored to prevent disharmony.

Some of the Futurists of the Early Twentieth Century supported Militarism and Fascism (and Eugenics) as an alternative to the class/monarchies - but many recanted after seeing the results of mechanical slaughter/warfare in the Great War and the horrors of the Second World War.

Colonial fiction might be of interest to you - [The White Man's Burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden) by Kipling is an Imperialist appeal for Empire to invade 'inferior nations.' Like Manifest Destiny. You'll probably want to read lots of dead white British Imperialists, but they were challenged even in their lifetimes and have only become more unpopular.

Finding novels which support totalitarianism might be difficult - totalitarianism and authoritarian regimes tend to treat novelists poorly - Control of the present means control of the past (We have always been at war with Eurasia!) and control of the future (to paraphrase Orwell again.) You'll probably find a lot which support the status quo, or are revolutionary texts - albeit for a revolution to replace the current system with their own - *Mein Kampf, Turner Diaries, Unabomber Manifesto* etc.

Ayn Rand maybe - she wasn't a totalitarian though, even if her philosophy supports enslavement. You can be oppressed by a rugged individualist rather than government!

Marxism pushed for a dictatorship of the proletariat where governmental forces would seize means of production to later be distributed to the people (which happened a lot more in theory than in practice). This was considered an essential stage in the process of reaching full ""true"" communism.

Now of course, to achieve this dictatorship, one requires a few things:

1. A strong central government with a monopoly on violence to seize these means of production,
2. A strong head of government to oversee this redistribution,
3. Some method of overthrowing the old government (who presumably would like to keep their position), and
4. Some method of overcoming the influence and control of the ""bourgeoisie"" (who presumably would like to keep their stuff).

This means that a dictatorship and it's supporters could justify a strong government with a tyrannical dictator, as a man ""leading the vanguard of the revolution through whatever (violent) means necessary.""

That's why so many different dictators are, or claim to be, socialists, from Hitler and the Nazis, to Stalin and the CCCP, to Hussein and the Ba'athists.

Mao's book and Mein Kampf do sort of the same thing, they push for this grander world if only certain things be changed (more devotion to the leader, or elimination of pesky bad groups).

He finds himself in the same location (Boston, Massachusetts), but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000, and while he was sleeping, the United States has been transformed into a socialist utopia.
