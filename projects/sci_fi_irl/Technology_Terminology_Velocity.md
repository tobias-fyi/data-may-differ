# Technology Terminology Velocity

By Tobias Reaper

The goal for this project is to tell a story about the velocity of technology terminology. I came up with a list of tech terms that are either buzzwords or have been in the recent past, and I will use those as my keywords for querying the PushShift API. I will aggregate the number of comments (and submissions?) that contain the keywords, and explore the data across time and across different online communities (subreddits).

My hypothesis is that the rate at which new terminology (and by transferrence, the technology behind the terms) differs between subreddits. More specifically, I hope to explore the time lag between when a new technology is introduced and when it begins to "soak into popular discouse", so to speak.

If my hypothesis does happen to be accurate, how large is that time lag? How long does it take for the terminology of new technology to make its way books, movies, TV?

Regardless of the outcome, I hope that my exploration of the data will prove interesting.

## Methodology

### High-Level High-Brow

#### For Key in Words

In order to find anything interesting, it was very important to come up with effective criteria for choosing terms to search. Not only did I want each term to encompass a relatively specific technology, industry, or ideology, but also be general enough to be explored in non-technical books and stories.
