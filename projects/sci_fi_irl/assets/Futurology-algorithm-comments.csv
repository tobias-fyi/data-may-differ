Also at the least, a delegate would have to be aware of who's votes he has, if not have every vote public. Even if this were put online where you select your delegate for an issue, if the web page just said ""sorry you cannot assign this candidate as a delegate"", you'd give up if all of your top choices were gone. This means that there's something of a race to pick your delegate so you're not the one that completes a cycle.

6,[],Cyaed,,gray,[],,Discordian Ethicist,dark,text,t2_tf6ig,False,[],"""Wasting"" qubits is a fait accompli of general purpose quantum architectures. They need to be spent on error correction. Classical computers also ""waste"" transistors - look up parity bits some time. If it still seems like quantum computers are inherently worse.... Well, they are. Right now, the best quantum computers are around where classical computers were in the 1960s at best. Still, though: while a quantum computer might be worse that a classical computer for the types of problems that classical computers excel at, if we use it for that problem, we're doing it wrong.

Computer algorithms are classified according to their *time complexity*. This is a measure of how fast they run. Two important classes are P and NP. P stands for **P**olynomial time complexity. Any algorithm in P runs in an amount of time that can be described as a polynomial. NP stands for **N**on**p**olynomial, and contains algorithms that - as you increase the amount of data they need to crunch - are eventually slower than anything in P. 

Quantum computers are special because they can run algorithms in yet another time complexity class called BQP at the same speed as a classical computer runs algorithms in P. When a classical computer tries running something in BQP, at best it will run BQP in NP, and at worst it will run in an even slower time complexity like EXPTIME (time complexity that can be described with an exponential).

Being able to tackle BQP problems in polynomial time means being able to do things like directly simulate protein folding without any simplifications, or being able to do a brute force search for room-temperture superconductors considering thousands of cnadidate materials a day - currently scientists have to figure out how to manufacture a material before they can determine superconductivity. By the same token, we would be able to create evolutionary algorithms to build nanomachinery, or to create hyper-effective drugs and then verify that they were safe digitally by making sure they didn't interact with any biomolecules. Imagine artificial viruses that only killed cancer cells with total lethality. The standard model of physics is good enough that if we had the machines, we could simulate the universe in acceptable detail to fully digitise and automate  - but classical computers aren't those machines.

Quantum computers *are*.

That we have to spend a few qubits dealing with the uncertainty doesn't change the fact that a quantum machine will be able to do in minutes what would take a classical computer the size of jupiter longer than the expected lifetime of the universe to accomplish, in it's field of excellence. Don't knock it.

15,[],Lou-Saydus,,,[],,,,text,t2_dxmbt,False,,"Quantum computing is a special field of computer science that relies on the manipulation of qubits instead of bits (more on that later). In theory quantum computers can run a statistical calculation and compute all of the outcomes simultaneously instead of one at a time. Obviously this is massive speed up when there are many many outcomes to an algorithm.

A bit is the smallest piece of information a computer can store and manipulate. A bit can be one or zero. Pack 8 bits together and you get a byte. 1024 of those together and you get a kilobyte, 1024 kilobytes is a megabyte and so on and so forth. A qubit can be a one or zero aswell, it can also be any number between one and zero, at the same time. In fact a qubit represents every value from 1-0 but the chance of it being any specific number follows a probability curve and only resolves to an actual number when measures. You can take advantage of that super position by running calculations before it's observed, thus allowing you to traverse a massive amount of calculations simultaneously.

The problem? Qubits are VERY sensitive to the outside world and will spontaneous collapse into regular information if not kept under ideal conditions. A long lived quibit only exists for a few nano seconds. You can see how it would be hard to take advantage of this state when you're trying to get many qubits to interact. Beyond that, because each qubit represents a probability, everything can go perfectly and still give you the wrong answer by pure chance. You need to run operation many times to build up a map of what is the correct answer by measuring what outcome happens the most often.

According to Johnson, they indicate that the algorithm can predict the start of a slow slip earthquake to “within a few days — and possibly better.”


however..

&gt; The goal of earthquake forecasting has never been to predict slow slips. Rather, it’s to predict sudden, catastrophic quakes that pose danger to life and limb. For the machine learning approach, this presents a seeming paradox: The biggest earthquakes, the ones that seismologists would most like to be able to foretell, are also the rarest. How will a machine learning algorithm ever get enough training data to predict them with confidence?

&gt;The Los Alamos group is betting that their algorithms won’t actually need to train on catastrophic earthquakes to predict them. Recent studies suggest that the seismic patterns before small earthquakes are statistically similar to those of their larger counterparts, and on any given day, dozens of small earthquakes may occur on a single fault.

I haven’t actively perused the sub in years but, before 2016, the many top scoring submissions very consistently came from comparatively few usernames. These usernames used to have post karma scores in the millions, before Reddit changes its vote fuzzing algorithm and most top scoring posts only had around 1-2k upvotes. These user’s submissions would very consistently score 1-2k upvotes across different subreddits and this would often happen over a dozen times daily. Back then, desktop Reddit used to give you a warning when you were making a repost. It was virtually impossible to post a national headline without getting a warning that the story was already posted several times before, even if the headline was only about an hour old. 

All this points to the submissions of certain usernames being automated with scripts and a fairly high likelihood of vote manipulation.

The scenario you're talking about seems to suggest that humans are 100% accurate at spotting certain things, machines 100% at spotting other things, and we should use both to get maximum coverage. But that's not how it works. Humans perform inconsistently. The same human can see the same image a year later and draw totally different conclusions.

Point being, you'd have no way of knowing which things humans were better at, and if you DID identify such things then it ought to be easy to add a step within the machine's decision-making algorithm to do that thing.

Since when? They will train on real life images - the same exact images clinicians are looking at. 

&gt; and asked one y/n question about it: does this person have disease x?

That may be the question that is asked - but the binary answer provided isnt because that's how the algorithm interprets it - its because that's what a human wants to know. Nearly all computer vision algos will provide a confidence in an identification. Combine that with images/scans and it will say ""well I'm 60% sure I see something at this angle, 80% sure at this angle and 20% sure at this angle"" - it will then come back with a 'I am x percent sure that I've identified whatever I'm looking for in this image' - the binary output is just humans giving it a threshold.

If its trained on all those dozens of possibilities, then this wont be a problem.  

&gt; I think we have a long, long way to go before AI ever replaces doctors in reading images.

Your thinking is too binary. Medical professionals will never be completely removed from the image reading process - but the pipeline will be changed, especially as the face of medicine changes. Initial passes will be done with machines - should an anomaly be detected it will be flagged for further review by a human that can make the diagnosis. 

If you think that we're a long, long way off, take a minute to consider that the majority of industry standard deep learning software (Microsoft CNTK, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Karas, etc..) were only developed and released in the past 3 years, and each year (sometimes even month) practitioners are absolutely smoking the previous years performance measures. That's why there is so much hype - because people can apply these techniques to real world problems - outside of labs and academia.

Typically speaking, a machine learning experiment will get a bunch of images of healthy people and a bunch of images of people with e.g. a kind of brain tumour. Their ML algorithm is then trained on this dataset to discriminate between the two, and subsequently is tested on a new set and often is pretty damn good at the job.

The issue is the noise present in medical data. In this case, MRI brain scans within a given study will have all been collected on the same scanner with identical acquisition parameters. When you introduce hospital #2 into the equation, who also have a 3T machine but it's made by Philips instead of GE and their T1 sequence had got marginally different echo and repetition times... then the algorithm falls apart because its just as sensitive to systematic differences in the images due to the new set of scans as it is to tumours vs. healthy tissue. i.e. It'll pick up people as having a disease just because they were scanned at a different hospital.

Some studies address this by training on multiple sets of data, but you'll still only be looking at like 3 sites when actual clinical implementation would need to cover so much more variability than that.

They do more than just read scans. The contextual information is vital with regards to diagnosis, which is the point. Again, what does 86% accuracy with regards to polyp identification from a radiology AI mean for the treatment plan, in normative terms? Would you risk going with a AI program that has 86% accuracy with regard to just finding polyps, not whether they are cancerous or not, if it was someone in your family? 

I'm extremely skeptical of such ambitious proclamations as ""there will be no more applied radiologists at hospitals,"" and I would like to complicate that notion, if I could. I do think it is possible that there will be fewer radiologists, as it isn't an especially popular specialty despite the pay and the growth in the job market, which American med schools can barely fill, as during Match less than 1000 of all radiology sub-specialties were filled. The BLS data suggests a growth rate of 15%, which means that there will be around 5000 new positions for radiologists yearly to the mid-2020s, which doesn't indicate the specialty being phased out. 

Even then, if these programs can be developed with solid metrics in mind, they would be trained faster with ""labeled data."" Every program that has achieved a high level of success in nearly all of these studies had been trained on labeled images. But there is no labeling repository for radiographic images; if there were, I'd imagine there would be a lot quicker improvement in these programs. I know of one company that employs radiologists for the sole purpose of labeling images. For comprehensive accumulation of images for training, you will almost certainly need radiologists to compile that data, label it and organize it. Even still, given that radiology is a specialty that is created because of technological advancements, it's just as likely that the role of radiologist will shift, and the need will still be as great as these programs proliferate. 

There are also massive issues with regard to liabilities. Who is responsible if an algorithm misses a cancer case? Would it be the vendor, who no doubt will promise high accuracy? Which physician would be responsible? Would the hospital take on that liability? It's almost assured that these issues will be ironed out much slower than the pace of technology. Once liability issues are resolved, there is the whole issue of regulation and payment. I'd wager that the FDA would issue stipulations that require a radiologist trained in the program to be present when the scan is running, as that is the easiest way of determining liability, as well as satisfy any possible new requirements for insurance reimbursement.

Or maybe, ""we put in this gastic tube to feed our patient and want to make sure its in the stomach."" These are basic questions that can be automated, send a thousand pictures of different lines or tubes in right or wrong places and I'm sure a machine can figure it out.

Radiologist gets a CT scan, does the read, and finds different signs indicative of two or three other possibilities. The physician then calls the radiologist to discuss the case with the radiologist and maybe after the discussion the radiologist recommends another kind of study based on their own understand of the literature, based on their own understand of the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging modalities available for the conditions being considered, based on what the studies the patient may or may not be able to tolerate.

First, your thinking  is mostly correct that ""higher-level"" languages (interpreted languages,  languages with complex runtimes or, etc.) typically run slower than  compiled languages. There's a lot of discussion that could be had around  that statement, and it certainly comes with caveats and exceptions, but  in general it's true. However, in this case, C++ and Rust are both  compiled languages, and so rewriting an application in Rust would not  see much change in performance (assuming the application is written as  similarly as possible, in other words, a port to Rust's syntax without  use of the unique nuances of the language that are not present in C++).

However,  Rust has some features that typically makes it an easier language for  writing memory-safe applications compared to C++. So, taking advantage  of these features can make it easier for a programmer to make certain  applications faster in Rust compared to C++ (it's still doable in C++,  but requires more complexity in the programming techniques used).

But  the key thing here is to look at what Brave actually did. They weren't  just rewriting the existing adblocking algorithm in a different  language. They were making fundamental changes to the algorithm itself,  changes that were easier to program by switching to a new language.  These algorithmic changes are where the real performance gains were  realized.

The change is detailed  in this blog post, but I'll give a brief explanation (EDIT: the link  appears to be blacklisted by Reddit, so just copy/paste the URL into  your address bar): brave.com/improved-ad-blocker-performance/

Essentially,  an adblocker works by matching URLs against a list of patterns. If the  URL matches any of these patterns, it is blocked. The lists are very  long, and the patterns can be quite complex, so the adblocker attempts  to optimize how it does its matching. In Brave's old implementation,  they used the assumption that most requests will not be blocked to  optimize their algorithm. However, after some experimenting, they found  that about 39% of real-world URL requests are blocked, which was more  than they expected. So they restructured their algorithm with this in  mind. This time, instead of assuming that most \*URLs\* will not match any  patterns, they make the assumption that most \*patterns\* will not match a  URL (even though there is likely some pattern that matches the URL).  They then go on to group patterns by likelihood, and use a further  tokenization technique on the patterns for faster matching.

Just look at YouTube's watch algorithm.

It's ended up spotlighting and suggesting very problematic videos , from conspiracy stuff, to creepy Spiderman vs Elsa kids videos. It doesn't know what it's doing, it just knows that suggesting xyz will increase the likelihood of user Hunter2 staying on the site longer and generating ad revenue.

At the moment that's as insidious as it goes. But it isn't much of a stretch to see that getting out of hand. A more advanced general AI might decide that Mr. Hunter2 could watch more videos if he didn't have a job.

The one-way property (at least, the definition in said open problem) requires that you can't easily find *any* input that corresponds to a given output. There can be many possible correct answers, but if the function is one-way, then it should be intractable to find any of those correct answers (except by exhaustive search). This is currently practically the case with pretty much all cryptographic hash functions (even MD5, which is broken in other ways, but still has good preimage resistance as far as I know), but there are no mathematical proofs that we will never find a fast preimage algorithm (and there wont likely be proofs anytime soon, since you would have to prove P!=NP first).",1567970549,{},ezl28bb,False,t3_d125bh,False,True,t1_ezkvkxv,/r/askscience/comments/d125bh/how_do_one_way_hashes_work/ezl28bb/,1567970559,1,True,[],False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,[],SkeletonRuined,,,[],,,,text,t2_7six94j,False,,"A one-way hash is a function which is easy to calculate forwards, but difficult to invert.

For example, SHA256 is conjectured to be a one-way hash function. An easy way to see the SHA256 hash of any string is to use an online calculator like this one: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html

If you have an input, say 'flopdood', then you can easily put that in and see the hash: 4cd4aee8ae42396f7b226fb1be20ff839778afb29ea05200c7f3e69d2cdd0104

But, if I give you a hash output, can you find the input?

One strategy to reverse a hash is to just guess inputs until you find one that gives you the desired output. This strategy always works, but if the input was random, then it's pretty inefficient. If you wanted to invert a random SHA256 output with this strategy, it would take basically forever. See this video for an illustration of how much time this would take: https://youtu.be/S9JGmA5_unY

If you happen to have a good idea of what the input should be, then you can invert the hash much more easily. For example, if you see a hash output of 'ae42396f7b226fb1be20ff839778afb29ea05200c7f3e69d2cdd0104', then you know the input was 'flopdood', since I showed you the other direction earlier in this comment. But if you have no idea what the input is, then you're stuck making random guesses.

But what if there's some clever algorithm that lets you calculate the inverse of a hash faster than just randomly guessing inputs? Then that hash function is not one-way!

We don't know for sure that SHA256 is one-way. But so far, no one has publicly inverted a random SHA256 output. Bitcoin actually relies on SHA256 being a one-way function in a few ways, so if someone did know an algorithm to invert it, they might be able to get free money. SHA256 is also used in HTTPS encryption (over which people send bank details, etc). Since there are monetary incentives for people to break these, and we haven't seen anyone break them, it gives some confidence that they aren't broken. But it's not for certain.

In fact, there is *no* function so far that has been proven to be one-way. The existence of one-way functions is still an open question in computability theory. It might be the case that no function is one-way. (For example, if P=NP, then one-way functions cannot exist. If P!=NP, then maybe one-way functions exist, but it's also possible that P!=NP and there are still no one-way functions.)

My brain will slow on the parts it wants to.  I see it twice,  that helps automatically.

I'm just worry it'll get dialed into the algorithm and turned into a mass produced product where I get an Alien or Apes movie every year.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care about Avatar, and I'm surprised knowing that there are people who do.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as Alien is concerned, they should have let that die after 3. That's a dead horse that needs to stop being beaten (Could say the same for Terminator as well.) no matter who is in charge. But therein lies a reason for my disdain. I want something new. Not something I've already seen. And that's what they're doing.  I don't need to see more Apes movies. War was a perfect end to the series, and I don't want a whole reboot of everything. Let it be what it is. Otherwise it becomes a whole new dead horse to smack around. It won't ""ruin"" the originals, it's just unnecessary.

Ask a rhetoric professor such as the eminent Dale Carrico and he'll tell you that this manner of speaking is employed in order to subjugate and dehumanize people. It may be okay for a mathematician to regard you as nothing but a machine, but how does this pan out if your boss, or a silicon valley billionaire, or a powerful world leader operates with this as their view of your humanity? Unfortunately, we know the answers to these questions and the answers are despicable almost beyond belief. Ask the historians. Many layers of frankly fake popular history have painted over our superstitious past as a time of madness and irrationality, but when people believed in mystical and sacred souls we might notice some major differences. The quite recently popular viewpoint that humans are soulless mechanical objects has underpinned what are undeniably the most violent, repressive, and barbaric acts of all time. There is just no comparing the warfare, repressive statecraft, and factories of death of last century with any other period, ever. Humanism was the midwife of dehumanization.

If it helps to reverse the analogy to help you understand, your body is a totally unique version of software with several billion years of sedimented memories that are intimately interrelated to every other being on this planet.

Because that's basically what you're getting. I mean, I know some of the guys who do it, and it would probably hurt their feelings to hear that. But it's true. Most of those books are written in a single draft, often at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 or MORE words per day. 

They crank out as many book as quickly as possible specifically BECAUSE Amazon's algorithm favors quick releases in terms of promoting the book. MASSIVELY. So if you have a readable first book that you practically give away, with at least one resolved plot line to prevent people from being pissed off at a non-conclusion, you can then string those same characters out over multiple books, releasing one every two weeks. The sales bumps from the first combine with the visibility bump of a new release to drive up their ratings rapidly.

I had this happen to me once and got up to #39 in the world in thriller writers for a few months. As to why I haven't done it again? Mostly vanity. I'm trying to write better books, not more of them. Eventually, however, I'll have to shore up the income by cranking out a new pulp fiction series.

Really, these guys are filling the slots left by the old 'dime store' novelists who got paid fuck all for their work and got little credit, usually giving up rights as well. At least with ebooks and Amazon, they get a 67% royalty. Unfortunately, basic pulp fiction just ain't that hard to write, so the number of people trying to make a buck has skyrocketed.

I saw this comment and thought it something worth sharing:
""I love and hate this idea...
Love the idea of a totally open credit bureau that values privacy and does not use medical loans against us. And has full transparency....

I do however not trust the government as we've seen w/ Trump it could easily swing from leftist egalitarianism to rightist fascism in 1-2 election cycles. Then they could use credit scores as a weapon.

I think instead the government should create a regulation platform for credit agencies where they must follow certain principles to be allowed to operate as such including:

* No medical debt.

* Full transparency on how credit scores are scored -- perhaps even being required to use a government sanctioned algorithm.

* Free credit reports to consumers and other tooling.

* Must provide free counselling and support to consumers.

For example, maybe poor people who moved to the middle class  haven't had experience in financial matters, so despite a decent income, are more likely to get into financial problems.

250,[],bobbyfiend,,,[],,,,text,t2_36gej,False,,"OK, this is potentially really cool, and the authors might be studying something never studied scientifically before, but there are some things to be concerned about, from the [stud](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0346-1)y this blog post-type article is based on:

*TL;DR: the study has red flags associated with ""impressive theory but unconvincing data"" situations*

1. It is really effing difficult to find out how many participants were in this study. Their write-up doesn't follow standard research report format, so (to me, used to reading such reports) it feels almost like they're hiding some key elements of their methods. They probably aren't hiding them, but they sure as hell aren't making them easy to figure out. They appear to maybe have 12 participants in their study. TWELVE.
2. They published this in a journal that is apparently OK with leaving out or obfuscating a few of the methodological details, and isn't a core journal for neuroscience research.
3. The specific method used for imaging isn't the most commonly-used method out there. To me, that suggests they tried a few methods, and when that happens the researchers almost always go with the method that gives them the results they expected. There are TWELVE participants. I would love to see results from a few different imaging methods presented together, for comparison.
4. Neuroimaging is itself under a lot of pressure right now to clean up its act RE: data fishing. The possibilities for p-hacking are built into the entire process, from the ground up: every pixel of an image used (even if it's processed and run through some statistics) is the result of an averaging algorithm, and the choice of which algorithm to use is, from what I understand, non-trivial. Then there's the statistical processes used to aggregate across images (averages of averages), also offering various choices. Finally, there are the statistical procedures used to estimate effect sizes or p-values or whatever, which also offer various choices. That, on top of the fact that there are multiple kinds of imaging techniques in the first place, creates an incredibly high likelihood that neuroimaging studies can represent, essentially, illusions created by the researcher's expectations. One way of reducing the chances of such an outcome is to have MORE THAN TWELVE participants (I keep putting that in caps, and yes I know that many neuroimaging studies are done with small N, but statistics says ""fuck your rationalizations; it's still a tiny N and your confidence interval is so big it can't fit into your mom's muumuu"").
4. I'm not super impressed by their ""nobody has ever studied this before"" line. Maybe they're right, but this is a claim about a personality trait. See the entire field of personality psychology. I don't know if most people have any idea just how many different theories and tests of personality have been created and studied (often with pretty reasonable empirical methods, though not brain scans) over the past 100+ years. I will bet 5 of my own actual dollars that someone else studied this. In fact, I'm going to try to find some time to search, later. Again, the authors' choice of journal seems fishy, and it seems unlikely that reviewers for ""communications biology"" or whatever would have any kind of in-depth knowledge of the personality research literature. **Edit: [of course this claim is bullshit](https://search.proquest.com/openview/47a2561455af6d80b4ff61c7ffb5b2bf/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=29096).**

The claim they make for #4 (above):

&gt;One also has the power to choose not to choose, deliberately to allow one’s actions to be determined automatically by surrounding events. Though other reflexive cognitive processes are the focus of intense attention3,4, such “volition-on-volition”—meta-volition, for short—**has not been previously investigated**. 

(My emphasis). Despite the fancy neuro-cognitive language, they're basically just describing something that would seem familiar to most people, possibly ""spontaneity"" or ""going with the flow"" or similar. It took me literally 10 seconds in google scholar (""personality spontaneity measurement"") to find the report linked above. I'm open to being wrong about this, but I really think these authors are full of shit when they claim they are the first people ever to study or even name this construct.

266,[],georgioz,,,[],,,,text,t2_ch041,False,,"&gt; The sense of ""self"" comes from conscious representation of associative neural architecture. As one goes through life, you development a ""narrative"" that expresses the continuity of your existence in terms of the goals your culture sets for you and the goals the brain happens to develop that are allowable within cultural and other constraints (e.g. cognitive capacities limit goals - few people can become theoretical physicists - it's simply impossible for most).

I actually think this goes even deeper. There are neuroscientists such as Malcolm MacIver who link consciousness and sense of self with capacity of living organizms to plan. Malcolm has a very interesting theory here. He argues that organisms with simple sensoric apparatus with limited reach that do not have need to plan are purely reaction based. Something happens - e.g. food or predator comes to their vicinity - and they just need to react. Water organizms are often like that due to natural way by which water obscures senses.

However when it comes to land animals and especially animals with advanced sensory such as eyes the situation changes - especially in landscape where predator and prey can use land features to play hide and seek. Suddenly predator needs to plan. It needs to visualize itself comming on its pray from certain angle using land features or plants to hide or even taking into account wind and other things to be useful.

The internet has commoditised almost everything it is used for, creating a post-scarcity economy. The only thing that is still scarce is our attention.

Many people, confronted with a deluge of content, as the article says, defer the impossible task of choosing the best content to gatekeepers such as Google Search or the recommended items on Amazon. They will consume whatever shows up in front of them and are not really interested in digging deeper, they just want to be entertained (or buy a pair of headphones). At best, the algorithm is unbiased and shows them the most popular items, which creates an endless loop where competitors are shut out. At worst, the algorithm is skewed in order to make money.

Those gatekeepers themselves are also popular because they are popular. being the ""default"" option. For instance, when you want to search something, you go to Google and not Bing. Even if both services are largely identical (and Google even has two more letters to type), you pick Google, because who cares about Bing? This process happened to all gatekeepers, from social media to Youtube, making the winners virtual monopolies that don't even require the use of anticompetitive practices to stay that way. The market is open for all to make a superior competitor, it's just that no one will care.

From this position, they can in turn decide which content will become a monopoly, based on what makes \_them\_ the most money. Their complement (content) is commoditised while they themselves are a monopoly, which as Econ 101 teaches, is a recipe for massive profit.

This dependence on gatekeepers then leads to a large number of content creators failing, and worse than that: finding themselves \_irrelevant\_ (great recipe for depression, btw). No matter how good you are at what you do, no one cares unless a gatekeeper believes they can make money by promoting you. This is the situation musicians were in 50 years ago, which was supposed to be remedied by the internet, but instead expanded to \_all\_ forms of content: news, apps, websites, small stores selling on Amazon, even movies and video games are going that route.

In the end, if the only thing subject to scarcity is our attention, gatekeepers who can optimise the benefits we get from our limited attention are the only players with a product that has value. Everything else is virtually worthless, because if it disappears, you'll just be served something else instead.

Bitcoin arouse out of the need for a anonymous, and universal currency. i.e.; the value of canadian currency vs us currency wouldn't change.

&amp;#x200B;

But to remain anonymous, but still be able to accurately record information, the transactions between bitcoin users needed to be encrypted with a complex mathematical algorithm. This is essentially a confidential checkbook or bank ledger. It makes sure that person A paid person B, but hides that information.

&amp;#x200B;

Each time a transaction is made using bitcoin, a computer has to use processing power to solve those algorithms and confirm that person A paid person B. Well, over thousands of transactions this can take up quite a bit of processing power to solve these complex algorithms to confirm each parties funds and transactions. The solution to this is to borrow public CPU power, (you and me) in exchange for a opportunity to get bitcoin through solving these algorithms. This is called bitcoin mining. I'm lending you my computers ability and processing power to help solve those algorithms and ensure all transactions are legitimate, in exchange to find bitcoins depending on how successful it is.

&amp;#x200B;

This means bitcoin is a currency whos value is consistent world wide, non taxable, extremely hard, almost impossible to steal, and totally anonymous.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin rapidly gained popularity, but concern and evidence of bitcoin being used to purchase contraband to avoid paying taxes, and launder money into other currencies, thus eliminating the paper trail.

&amp;#x200B;

Some bitcoin users were arrested and convicted of various crimes for participating in bitcoin transactions, where the money ultimately ended up in criminals hands and resulted in bad things happening. This didn't totally kill bitcoin, because the arguement could be made that the bitcoin users should have no liability in asking or knowing what their currencies are used for. This resulted in a rapid drop in bitcoin price,

&amp;#x200B;

It has since been rapidly spiking and dropping in price, but overall, gradually decreasing, and in my opinion, you should expect it to. It's too risky to invest in. It could be declared illegal by a government at any point because of the tax evasions and your assets would be frozen. Or god forbid you end up being charged criminally for reasons like the aforementioned, and lastly, as the use of cryptocurrency becomes more apparent in horrendous crimes like sex traffiking, i'd expect public outcry to rise over time if it somehow did take traction again over a moderate period of time.
